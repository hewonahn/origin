The vast majority of our gun homicides are perpetrated by gang members killing rivals over the drug trade. 70%+ of recovered guns originate from the US, with 20%+ of the remaining having defaced serial numbers making them untraceable.\n\nOur prime minister knows this. The problem is that a lot of the prohibited guns are smuggled through First Nations reserves that span across the US/Canadian boarder. Rather than dealing with the debacle of challenging Native reserve rights, our PM chose to take the action that has the least chance of reducing gun homicides. Banning the sale of Canadian handguns is nothing more than a vote grab meant to dupe city voters into believing that he is taking meaningful action.

The government is going after law abiding citizens, not the criminals. The government has no clue how firearms work, same with their own laws. And the laws they do pass are either so poorly written they make no sense or they just don't bother enforcing.\n\nA common gun control law people demand are Universal Background Checks, but they're ignorant to the fact that we've had that since 1993, the NICS system. In order to purchase a firearm from a store or manufacturer you must pass a NICS check, failure to pass one disqualifies you from buying a firearm, period. And if the store or manufacturer doesn't perform one and are caught, they are held responsible with severe punishment.\n\nA basic example of Government Incompetence involves this NICS system and the Maine Shooter. The Shooter should not have been eligible to purchase a firearm due to crimes previously committed, however because this was never properly reported he passed the NICS system. Additionally he also had a history of mental episodes that were also never properly reported.\n\nIn addition to this story are the numerous cases of people who have no history criminal activity or mental health issues who have purchased firearms and later used them in crimes. Universal Background Checks won't solve the problem because it hasn't for the past 20 years.\n\nAs for the Government having no clue how firearms work. A machine gun made in the year 1986 is completely legal for a regular citizen to own, all that is needed is extra paperwork and a special tax stamp. However a machine gun made after 1986 is not okay for a regular citizen to own. Not to mention the countless false statements made by American Politicians.\n\nIf we want to solve this crisis then doubling down on the laws that have been proven ineffective will not work."", ""It's mainly a mental health issue combined with a large population."", ""I am not American but you are wrong. Mass shootings happen mostly in places where it's NOT ALLOWED to carry a gun like:  schools, cinema or campus.

There are many vids where good guys quickly kill bad guys with guns but you won't see them on CNN or any democrat tv you have there."", 'American gun culture is completely different from the rest of the world. Before we get into why stricter gun laws wouldn\'t work, we need to get into why we can own guns in the first place.\r  \n\r  \nBy the time the US was created, they made the amendments. But the main one we need to focus on is the 2nd amendment. Many believe that it\'s simply just used for self defense or hunting, but that\'s far from correct. The main reason for the 2nd amendment is for the government to not get too much power, the founding fathers believed that if the American government suddenly became tyrannical, it\'s the citizen\'s duty to take down that tyrannical government before it takes action on them. It\'s the reason why citizens could have the same weapons that the military had back then. Many say ""oh well they didn\'t except AR-15s to exist"", the founding fathers would probably still stick with the 2nd amendment, because remember, the 2nd amendment was created so that militias and civilians have more power than the government. This is still relevent today and will be in the future, because we can all agree that the government isn\'t perfect and will take the chance to have full control over the American population, however, armed militas and civilians, backed by the 2nd amendment, prevents the government from having power over the people. Also the 2nd amanedment was created for militas to defend their homeland incase of an invasion from a foreign power.\r  \n\r  \nNow I\'ll explain why stricter gun laws would hardly reduce crime, perhaps even skyrocket it.\r  \n\r  \nNow, we all know that criminals don\'t follow laws, especially gun laws, so we can\'t expect gun laws to stop criminals from having guns, if anything, it will only take away guns from the innocent or incriminate them for having one.\r  \n\r  \nYou may point to other countries that banned guns and no longer had shootings, but remember, that\'s only because people complied with the regulations. This will be completely different in the US, because we all know the US has a lot of gun supporters, and almost all of them are stubborn, so you can\'t expect them to comply with regulations, especially criminals. The only thing left to do in that situation is to kick down doors and confiscate guns one by one. Not only is that unconstituational and illegal, but it will be incredibly expensive, difficult, ineffective, and incredibly dangerous.\r  \n\r  \nThere are 144 million houses in the US, a huge percentage of which has a gun inside it, but they don\'t know who would own a gun, so they would have to track and find 393 million guns (most of which are probably not even registered), among 326 million Americans, among 144 million households. Either that, or kick down every single door, and we all know that is illegal and just stupid. Just imagine the amount of money and time spent on this.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, people can simply hide their guns in their backyards, bury it.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, you should expect a rain of bullets if you kick down a gunowner\'s door down.\r  \n\r  \nThe chances of a 2nd civil war from happening will be certain, as gun supporters would try fighting the government, actually, probably almost everyone would try fighting the government.\r  \n\r  \nAll of this because you decided to ban some guns', 'because every time someone mentions gun control, they clutch their ar-15s a bit tighter', 'Why are non-americans so stubborn about minding their own damn business?', 'The majority of Americans favor more gun control.', '[removed]', 'The vast majority of murders committed with guns are by people who cannot buy or possess a gun legally.

I am super pro gun control while I am a gun owner. Nope not an American. European. In a country with some of the strictest gun laws world wide... Rates of legal gun ownership don\'t correlate at all with rates of gun crime. They are infact slightly anti correlated. That means the more legal gun ownership in a region the less gun violence. School shootings are very dramatic, disgusting acts of murder. In the US however ""regular"" street gun crime accounts for most firearms deaths (outside of suicide). Most mass shootings (4+ dead in a shooting) are committed not by white grudge school shooters but African American ""gangsters"", for lack of a better term, by far.\nFurther, I have multiple high powered semi automatic rifles. The notion that only in the US can you go to some sporting or outdoor shop and buy a military style rifle is laughable, idiotic and shows you have not the slightest insight to the topic... Every city here has a hunting outdoor or sporting shop that has racks and racks of semi auto rifles (AR10/AR15s) and semi auto shotguns, the ones that look like from the set of terminator for anyone who\'s no clue about guns. \nIMO the poisonous aspect in the US is public gun culture more than anything. Criminals will always get their hands on a gun no matter the gun controll laws. Fun fact, illegal guns are usually way cheaper than legal ones because they flood in and are traded across borders. So if you want one as a criminal, the illegal fire arm is cheaper not traceable and you need no paperwork for it and the govt. Does not even know it exists (removed ID numbers) and probably was brought in from some old arsenal or warzone.\n\nAnd then there is the aspect of social contagion. If there is no role models and presence for a certain crime there is little risk for it to occur. Serial killers for example were a phenomenon mostly contained to the 70s, 80s and 90s.

It is very valid that that would create a system where only criminals would have guns. In that respect, it's too little too late. Besides, most of the shootings are done by people obtaining illegal access to weapons by circumventing laws that are already in place. New laws won't make people who disregard laws suddenly obey them.\n\nWhile it's not just a mental health thing, we have some serious problems with our culture that other parts of the world don't. The diversity we have in our country brings more cultures in closer proximity of each other than most of the world. We have a fairly high strung expectation of success driven by the American Dream that pushes people to their limits. While many Asian countries have similar pressure, homogeneous culture and/or oppression keep them in line. Our society endorses all kinds of violence and act shocked when someone gets fed up with it. Banning guns won't stop them from killing people, it will just make us feel better about it because they kill less people. Not that that's a bad thing, but it's not practical to execute and does nothing to address the root problem.\n\nI short, some people discount gun control in the same way you discount mental health and justify it through their own self righteous means so they don't have to admit that they contribute to the problem too."", 'I‚Äôm not disarming myself while criminals have guns.

This second group is also willing to view guns as a sort of neccesary evil, with limited legitimate uses for things like self defense and hunting.\n\nThen there is the small but vocal contingent of us who view a civilian right to bear arms as not just a neccesary evil, but a positive good in its own right, and one fully in line with the philosophy of liberalism (for example, google my flair and the ""4 boxes of liberty"").  This group is willing to accept some firearms restrictions, but more along the lines ""ban all guns from some people"" rather than ""ban some guns from all people"".\n\nThen there is the smaller and arguably even more vocal group that wants to ban civilian gun ownership and confiscate all the guns full stop, something akin to the Australia model.', ""This is probably *the* most controversial topic on this sub along with Afghanistan.

It is obviously unrealistic to believe that criminals will disarm themselves, and a civilian ban on gun ownership would likely embolden violent criminals since policing currently is unwilling or unable to offer quick and competent responses or meaningful closure rates on violent crimes in much of the country. A total restriction on firearms would slowly whittle the existing stock of illegally owned firearms down but that would probably take a decade at least. \n\nAlso just in terms of personal liberty I believe it is and should be a right to have the means to defend oneself effectively.\n\nI believe a right to effective self defense can also be reconciled with evidence based restrictions. A belt fed machine gun or mortar has little use for self defense and should remain fairly heavily restricted.

Many confessions are extracted under duress. Some of those who admit guilt are plainly innocent, as recent exonerations have shown (see article). The extraordinary lack of safeguards for suspects in Japanese interrogation cells is a stain on the whole system, failing victims as well as those wrongly convicted.\n\nSay you did it, even if you didn‚Äôt\n\nIn a country more inclined than the West to think of itself as a big family collective, admission of guilt is often seen as the first step to readmission into society. It is also the surest route to a conviction. Prosecutors and police are thus under immense pressure to make suspects talk, and have powerful tools to encourage them to do so.\n\nCommon criminal suspects may be held in detention for 23 days without charge. Many have only minimal contact with a lawyer. Few interrogations are recorded, and then not in their entirety, so there is not much to stop interrogators piling in. Physical torture is rare, but sleep deprivation, which is just as effective, is common. So are various other forms of psychological coercion. Some interrogators use moral blackmail (‚ÄúThink of the shame you are bringing on your family‚Äù). A few, if they are convinced that the suspect is guilty, simply fabricate a confession and press the suspect into signing it.\n\nIn a court system without an adversarial approach to establish innocence and guilt, judges too rarely question whether confessions really are voluntary. Yet time and again innocent people have been shown to confess to crimes in the hope of a more lenient sentence‚Äîor simply to make the interrogation stop. In October a mother convicted of killing her daughter for the insurance money was released after a crime reconstruction proved her innocence. Last year Iwao Hakamada was freed after 46 years on death row when a judge declared that his conviction was unsafe (among other things, he appears to have been tortured at the time of his arrest). One lawyer estimates that a tenth of all convictions leading to prison are brd on false confessions. It is impossible to know the true figure, but when 99.8% of prosecutions end in a guilty verdict, it is clear that the scales of justice are out of balance.\n\nAs a step towards restoring due process, all interrogations should be filmed from start to finish. Suspects should have ready access to defence counsel, to whom prosecutors should also disclose all evidence. Interrogations should be much shorter; suspects should be properly rested. Investigators who fabricate evidence should be put in the dock themselves. Prosecution cases should rely more on detective work, and less on self-incrimination. Such reforms would not improve conditions in Japan‚Äôs psychologically brutal prisons. But they would give the innocent a better chance of keeping their liberty.\n\nEdit: here's the process to get a gun in Japan\n\nJapan 1Take a firearm class and pass a written exam, which is held up to three times a year. 2Get a doctor‚Äôs note saying you are mentally fit and do not have a history of drug abuse. 3Apply for a permit to take firing training, which may take up to a month. 4Describe in a police interview why you need a gun. 5Pass a review of your criminal history, gun possession record, employment, involvement with organized crime groups, personal debt and relationships with friends, family and neighbors. 6Apply for a gunpowder permit. 7Take a one-day training class and pass a firing test. 8Obtain a certificate from a gun dealer describing the gun you want. 9If you want a gun for hunting, apply for a hunting license. 10Buy a gun safe and an ammunition locker that meet safety regulations. 11Allow the police to inspect your gun storage. 12Pass an additional background review. 13Buy a gun."", 'this topic makes me so tired, and so sad to live in the US', 'As an Italian Liberal, i am anti gun.', '2nd amendment is an important part of ensuring individual\'s ability to protect their private property, civil liberty, and self.

I'm really struggling with gun control.,"It seems that the prevailing anarchist opinion is that gun control is bad (this didn't surprise me, obviously), and it's the last thing making me hesitate fully embracing the label.

I'm from England, and I've never seen a gun before in my life (in this country). I've never known anyone who owns a gun, and I don't know anyone who wants a gun. Gun crime is extremely rare, so rare that the police don't even have guns (not the standard police, anyway), and we don't have the cultral love for guns and obsession with self-defence that you see coming out of the US. I've never heard a gun shot, and I live in a small city. 

I think my issue is that I'm imagining what my life would be like if the Tories just decided to do away with gun control tomorrow in our current society, with everything else remaining the same. It would be hell, and I'd be terrified to go outside. I'd never go for walks in nature again, at least not alone, and I'd definitly never go out at night. I also see guns as noting more than something made solely to kill or cause harm... and I find it hard to see why that should exist in any society.

I'm asking you to persuade me, I guess. I really thought I'd found my people... until I thought about guns. I really wish they just didn't exist ü§£ What would gun ownership look like in an anarchist society? How do you go outside and  not have a panic attack knowing gun ownership is common? Any YouTube videos on the subject would be super helpful too.

Thanks, guys üòä",1adr5l5,125,187,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1adr5l5/im_really_struggling_with_gun_control/,"['I feel you on this, I\'m from the USA and the prevailing left-liberal wisdom is also that gun control is a necessary step towards reducing the violence in that society.\n\nThe way I\'m thinking about it these days is that, actually the mass-shooting phenomenon is pretty new. Before that, most gun violence was associated with other illegal activities like ""drug deals gone wrong"" or domestic violence. And when you look at these things, what you see is that mass shooters are right-wingers enacting vengeance, domestic violence comes from patriarchy, and people deal drugs because they need the money.\n\nSo the violence is a symptom of underlying problems like racism, misogyny, poverty. As these problems get worse, so does the violence. You can\'t solve the violence by taking away the guns because people have other ways of enacting it. For example, in the UK the same conversation is had, only it\'s ""knife crime"" and people get stabbed, so others want to lock up teens who feel they need to carry knives for their own protection.\n\nAnarchists will need guns and people who know how to use guns if they want to defend themselves against people who have guns. That\'s the root of the issue. It\'s a distant concern for people who are just organizing a soup kitchen, but it\'s a logical position if you believe that the state should not have the monopoly on violence.', 'I don\'t think anarchists are in general advocating for only cutting gun control. We merely cut gun control as a corollary of our opposition to all law and authority. If anarchists are exclusively trying to remove gun laws, I think they have missed the greater point of anarchism.\n\nMost of us are focusing on liberation which is a far broader project and has many more dimensions than gun ownership. Please do not view anarchism\'s merits based purely on a singular topic that is only a small part of the ideology. Of course gun control laws will have to go by our fundamental opposition to law. That said, gun safety is a bigger topic than just removal of the weapons - there\'s questions of best practices, safe uses, safe storage, etc. all of which has stalled in the US as a conversation, and ones that anarchists could be having to ensure safety in the here and now and ""after the revolution."" So if you\'re worried about this gun toting dystopia, anarchism is probably not going to result in that. \n\nI think almost all anarchists I know hate guns and firearms and violence. It is a necessary evil, but do not mistake our tacit acceptance as enthusiasm (though I\'m sure there are some anarchist enthusiasts, who are perfectly fine with their enthusiasm so long as they are not trying to shove owning a firearm down the throat of anybody within earshot).', 'Please be aware that Anarchism is pretty fluid, those who tell you that you aren\'t an anarchist just because of that, do not fully understand Anarchism.\n\nThat\'s said, guns are simply a tool, it is the overall environment that makes them useful or dangerous.\n\nIf a society needs everyone to be armed all the time, that\'s a very bad, probably psychotic society. It sounds even odd to call it a ""society"",  given the lack of sociality and probably very few healthy relationships between people; it sounds more like war than anything else.\n\nAnarchism is against strict laws in general, and I guess that\'s why people get obsessed about gun control. Still, having sensibile rules that are self-imposed and shared, is the better view in my opinion. This means that an Anarchist society could agree on not holding weapons, while still giving anyone the chance of having one.\n\nI\'ll conclude saying that I don\'t like guns either, and I wish very much to live my life without ever seeing one.', ""I think context matters and practicalities of today are different from the realities of an anarchist utopia.\n\n\nI live in a country in top 10 of handguns per capita and we have very little gun violence. Under the current systems and culture, I'd not make getting a gun any easier.\n\n\nThere's other stuff to focus on first, like decentralizing and promoting worker ownership etc"", 'The thing about anarchism is that it is *not* ""the current society"", but a far different, not yet realized, one (or many!). Relaxing the gun control in that case may not be the *first* thing one would want to do in transforming that society toward anarchism.', 'Just to tighten you up on the UK, guns are very much legal to own and plenty of people do.\n\nDitto crossbows, the semi-automatic versions of which are functionally and effectively guns.\n\nHandguns were very tightly controlled after Dunblaine bar competition pistols but these and rifles are legal to own with a licence and a genuine, non-defence reason to own such as pest control, hunting or sport.\n\nGetting a licence varies in ease by local police force - much easier in rural areas where there is open land and more genuine reasons for ownership.\n\nSome standard bobbies do carry firearms here - Nottingham police force was the first outside the met I think, to arm them against gun crime 15 or so years ago.\n\nGuns are a lot more prevalent on the streets than you seem to think - the main difference here is they tend to be stashed and retrieved as needed because of the heavy penalties for possession.\n\nI think the whole issue is far more related to the societal motivations for gun violence - oppression, poverty, perceived danger.\n\nA gun in itself is just something that can kill a thing from far away, such tools are very good in their proper use case and I believe the individual should be free to own and safely operate them.', ""Truth be told, even in my ideal anarchist post-revolutionary society, I don't exactly see private ownership of guns as a great idea. Rather, I'd advocate for communal gun ownership on a local, decentralized level, with an armoury of some sort in most if not all towns and villages, so that in case of an emergency, the people can arm themselves.\n\nAs for the here and now? Well... I'm from a part of Europe without gun proliferation myself, too, and I'd argue introducing private ownership of guns into our societies indeed wouldn't be the brightest idea. I do think that over in the US, things are a bit more complicated, but let's face it: No amount of privately owned guns is going to enable the American people to go up against their government's military industrial complex in any realistic way, shape or form. What is a gun going to do against a swarm of drones or a tank?"", '>I\'ve never known anyone who owns a gun, and I don\'t know anyone who wants a gun.\n\nThey\'re called your local MP. They\'re called Parliament. They\'re called the Crown. Just go look at the boys in funny hats outside Buckingham Palace. They\'ve always wanted guns, and they\'ve been using them to abuse people for a very long time.\n\nThe worst part is the bulk of the violence they did to you happened [well before you were born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure). And they did that with muskets.\n\n(As an aside, all that is without touching on your government\'s long history of violence towards Ireland, India, Africa, and much of the known world.)\n\nGun control as an argument rests on the assumption that guns are so dangerous that only a trusted and privileged few (i.e., cops, soldiers, governments in general) can be trusted to have them. Problem is, the actions of those trusted and privileged few are the very best argument against gun control. The British Empire did many terrible things. The US Army was conducting acts of genocide back when muskets were standard issue. Belgium conducted genocide in the Congo under Leopold II. France abused Algeria and Vietnam. And that\'s without discussing the low-hanging fruit we know as Germany, Japan, Russia, and China.\n\nNow if you want to take the position that no one needs guns, that\'s your business. Anarcho-pacifism is a perfectly valid philosophy. I reject pacifism because I don\'t believe it is the responsibility of the oppressed and marginalized to be peaceful in the face of violence- it is the responsibility of the abuser and oppressor to stop the violence. If [Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_massacre) and [Hungerford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungerford_massacre) are sufficient by themselves to justify restricting arms from the workers, then [Bloody Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1972)) is sufficient cause to justify banning the British government from owning guns.\n\nBut if one is to take the position that no one needs guns, it needs to be ***no one***. The part that has always annoyed me about gun control, especially the nO oNe nEeDs a wEaPoN oF wAr crowd, is that they happily and unironically maintain standing armies, police states, and nuclear arsenals, even knowing the evils governments the world over have done. Capitalism requires guns to enforce property rights, and it works best when all the firepower is concentrated in the hands of capital and government sympathetic to capital. An armed and educated proletariat frightens capital and Caesar more than white supremacists and fascists ever have.\n\n\\[Last second thoughts: I think a good chunk of why you\'re afraid of guns is simply due to a lack of exposure to them. I didn\'t grow up with guns at all, didn\'t handle them until my mid 20s. I\'m not afraid of guns now. Exposure and familiarity gets rid of fear. When I see people with guns, I just think ""Cool. Nice firearm."" I don\'t wonder if they\'re an incipient mass shooter, because the overwhelming majority of gun owners aren\'t looking to cause trouble. They just want to be able to defend themselves.\\]', ""I used to think exactly like you although being from the US I have shot guns before. But I'm genuinely afraid to be in public spaces more and more. I'm so afraid my children we be caught in a school shooting. The high school where my daughter will go to high school had a couple shootings this past year. It's horrifying.\n\nBut like others said, it's more the systemic underlying causes of capitalism and oppression that cause the negative side effects of gun violence."", ""Guns are currently only allowed broadly in state hands on the UK. I'm not currently but have been a gun owner, I don't live in the UK anymore. I've been a shooter since I was a kid (we had a gun range at school, it was like Harry Potter but with violence instead of magic).\n\nGuns are tools that can be used for all sorts of things other than murdering people. I'm a vegetarian but I have a close friend who only eats meat he hunts and I'm all for it (he is in the UK).\n\nAs an example, a local area might have an agreement that guns aren't welcome in a certain place or at certain times and people with no reason for conflict will for the most part follow that conduct. \n\nWho is going to apply gun control? In anarchy there's no state to apply top down controls. No one can ban guns, because then you have someone exerting that power over others and that's a hierarchy that would need constant vigilance for as long as it needed to exist to ensure it didn't get all authoritarian.\n\nNote that gun controls in the UK are pretty tough, if the laws are the same you can't own pistols which are far more likely to be used in a crime than the scary looking assault rifle you see fat American neo Nazis rocking. Many societies have high gun ownership but aren't as culturally fucked as the USA, so the guns stay locked up. America is a poor use case. \n\nCrimes of passion would happen, but you're really unlikely to be mugged in a society based on equity, responsibility and mutual aid. Mental health would also be greatly improved.

I live in the US. I've never seen anyone get shot. I walk around pretty much wherever I want to, except the absolute worst neighborhoods. Gun violence is definitely a problem but it's not as common as the media would have you think. The media sells violence. Mass shootings are extremely rare. What's far more common are gang-related shootings, which are more so caused by poverty than anything else. If people had their basic needs taken care of, there wouldn't be all this poverty and gang stuff, and gun violence would be drastically reduced. Gun control is never the answer, it only increases the disparity in power between the people and the state, which is already far too large of a disparity. The solution to the vast majority of gun violence is just taking care of people's basic needs. The vast majority of gun violence is caused by generational poverty."", ""Anarchism is against monopoly of gun ownership. It's either give everyone access to guns or take everyone's away.

If the state has access to weapons of war and the people do not then there is no parody and the state can go on a rampage of violence and genocide with the people having very little recourse to this. When the people have parody the state is unable to steam roll them and must disarm the people prior to unleashing its true violent intent.\n\nI understand that many people would attempt to debunk this saying ""the government has jets, tanks, etc"" but the truth of the matter is that no state has ever defeated a determined insurgency that has had the support of the local population. Look no further than the middle east, decentralized insurgents have bankrupted the US empire, the most technologically advanced empire ever, and insurgents are still frustrating and have been frustrating countries like Israel, Saudi, UAE. These insurgents fight with small arms and limited tech for the most part but are able to frustrate, and through attrition, eventually defeat the invaders in their lands.\xa0\n\nThe deep rooted ‚Äúlove for guns‚Äù as you put it in Americans stems from the US revolution in which decentralized insurgents, Minutemen/militia men, rose up and were able to defeat the global empire of their time, The UK. The UK at the time had access to the most modern of military implements and weapons while the Revolutionaries largely rose up with nothing but hunting rifles and other small arms. The militia men understood that engaging in conventional warfare with the Brits would only result in redcoat forces being able to fix the much smaller and less equipped militia forces in one spot and overwhelm them with the dominating firepower that conventional forces have at their disposal. Instead the American forces would engage the redcoats in unconventional ways, ambushing, sniping at leadership, attacking less defended supply routes, and otherwise not playing the game that the larger conventional forces wanted to play. Still today many US citizens who ‚Äúlove their guns‚Äù understand the true purpose behind said guns, not only to resist common criminals but also to resist the state.\xa0\n\nThis was extremely effective and obviously the revolutionaries were able to defeat the brits, and it was possible even though only 3% of the population at that time actually took up arms to fight. This is the key, the people need parody with the State AND a supportive population. Even though only 3% of people actually fought, behind the scenes supporting members played a far more valuable role. The farmers, merchants, bar keepers, etc. that supported the revolution in non-direct ways contributed greatly to the success of the revolution. This is also why the American Native Indians were able to be effectively defeated by the US later on because the white population at the time did not support the Native insurgency and would assist the state in their attempts to eradicate them. Very reminiscent of Zionist colonizers who move onto Palestinian land and cry out for the military to come and crack down on the Palestinian people for trying to defend it.\n\nIts the same concept behind armed protesting, if protestors are just as armed as the cops they seem to be a lot less keen on using their toys to beat on people.\n\nSo long and short is small arms in the hands of even a few determined fighters with their community backing them up will win the day. It\'s not pretty, it\'s still extremely violent and the fight may take decades, centuries maybe, but eventually the state will collapse under its debt and overspending as it finds itself continually frustrated by groups of everyday people with basic fighting weapons.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Don\'t take this as me sucking off the American revolution and founders I am an Anarchist and I do understand the many flaws in the American revolution and our ""Founding Fathers""\\*\\*\\*', 'In conditions of Anarchy, defined as total lack of authority, heirarchy, laws, and state, there would be no state or legal constructs with which to weild any control.

I own three firearms as well as multiple bladed articles.\nOne of my firearms is a child friendly air rifle. One is a revolver and one is a rifle.\n\nThe revolver and rifle use CO2 which makes them legal. They are still powerful enough to do damage or even unalive someone.\n\nAnd there are more legal reasons to be able to get a more powerful gun in terms of the license than you might think. But you don't have to register even powerful CO2 aslong as they're just under the legal limit. \n\nIn terms of blades obviously not firearms , but I have the legal right to carry one with me which I do, which is a pretty large hunting knife.\n\nAlthough police might stop you and make a fuss, it comes down to knowing the law and following the letter of it.\n\nPolice will use batons and guns.\nFascists will use knives and sometimes even acid.\nWe beat the fascists on the street most of the time, especially with the numbers of say, the AFN.\n\nAnd the more extreme violence doesn't happen that often.\nI can say from personal experience though I have had police pull guns on me numerous times.\nAnd have had guns pulled on me by hunters.

Let\'s say you are the only person in your community that hates(HATES) guns, whilst other 99 are gun-nuts and think everyone should be armed for safety of everyone . You could stay and cooperate, or you could leave and find a gun-free community.\n\nGun co trol in it\'s current state is imposed by the state, so every anarchist should be against it. However, freely associating/disassociating with gun-lovers should be also supported by every anarchist.\n\nIn practice, you wouldn\'t have these extremes, you would figure out with the others a situation where they are free to own guns, whilst people not fond of them would be kept safe and away from them.', ""Regarding the fear of going out aspect, I'm not afraid because of personal experience. Out of 30+ years in living here, I've never been shot at, and I've been in different neighborhoods, states, and cities. In my opinion the media has overblown the issue. You are just as likely to die in a car accident as you are to a gun, and most gun deaths are suicides. If you are not suicidal or live in gang territory, you're unlikely to be on the receiving end of a bullet.\n\nSomething else that helps with a fear of firearms is becoming acquainted with them. I know in the UK guns are heavily restricted, but if there is some way for you to be able to shoot (don't start with a shotgun!) that will help you to know the limitations of these weapons as well as the fact they can be responsibly handled. One pro gun control media person here in the US thought because she was clumsy that everyone else is too, and that we haven't designed firearms to accommodate for that either. Some personal knowledge of how they work can help a good deal.\n\nAs a means of self defense nothing is as close to being egalitarian as a firearm. Blades require strength and training to use properly. Archery and martial arts require the same. Firearms require some training too, but you can show someone more or less how a firearm works and have them be combat effective in less than 10 minutes, obviously there are some exceptions. The only amount of strength you need is to be able to cycle the action, hold the weapon and pull the trigger, and there are various designs to meet a person's needs there too.\n\nI hope that was helpful. Feel free to ask questions."", 'So first off, guns exist so you can\'t just get rid of them. Once you open up that that Pandora\'s box, there\'s no way to lock it back up. Second, consider the U.S. We have literal more guns than people. And with that, we actually have so much little gun crime proportionally per our population, it actually speaks to how relatively well the U.S. works as an advocate of gun ownership for the individual. Guns are a tool and they can be a powerful tool and like any tool, they need to be treated respectfully. \n\nThird, think about the reason why you don\'t have that gun culture. Why did that develop? Because your government decided to pursue policies to take away guns over time. Foundationally, it\'s about controlling the population and making it harder for them to resist the power of the state. Our first real gun restrictions in the U.S. were about controlling black people after the Black Panthers marched into the California office and Reagan enacted that. \n\nSo here\'s the issue. By continuing to embrace gun control even as a legitimate concept, what you\'re speaking to is the ability of the government to corral people, especially minorities as they are the ones who are harmed the most by these policies. And in several ways, that gun control has negligible effects on making people ""more safe"" especially when the police continued to be armed and your own government still has that monopoly and commit violence on a daily basis.\n\nAlso, most people aren\'t dealing with gun violence on a daily basis. Honestly, I feel like this is the kind of paranoia that comes out of having never actually experienced a thing. Because you are so removed from guns in your part of the world, you can\'t even conceive how people operate around the assumptions of guns. Fact of the matter is, we act like people normally do. Be aware that a person might have a gun and don\'t be paranoid about it. \n\nSo yeah, if you go an anarchist society, most people will probably own guns. But alongside that, we advocate for education, training and safe use. Just because we want people to own guns and be free, doesn\'t mean we shouldn\'t be safe about them.', ""3D printers make gun control arguments void. You can't stop the signal."", 'This is a multi-dimensional issue.  For example, what types of guns are people ""technically"" allowed to buy and what kind of guns are they actually able to buy.  For instance, in the US, anyone other than convicted felons can buy assault rifles.  They can then buy conversion kits that turn the semi-automated rifles into fully automated rifles/machine guns. While the modification itself is technically illegal, typically you would discover that after a mass shooting.  \n\nUsing a TLI - theoretical lethality index: At the time the Constitution was written a rifle could be used to kill 45 people/hour - that is the TLI.  A modern assault rifle modified to be fully automatic - has about 100 times the TLI.  One modern person = 100 revolutionary war people.  \n\nThat said - my wife\'s good friend was home in her apartment right after college.  A guy working for the apt complex used a skeleton key to come into her apartment.  Luckily she was in the back bedroom when she heard him.  She slid open her night table drawer, pulled out a fully loaded hand gun and said: If I see you in the doorway, I will shoot you.  Moments later she heard the outer door open and close.  \n\nSo - complicated topic.', 'As someone who also lives in a very low-gun country (Ireland), this is something I struggle with as well.\n\nI think it‚Äôs worth asking the question: if ‚Äúthe revolution‚Äù happened tomorrow, all coercive government was abolished and people were left to create new social organizations based on mutual consent, is it necessarily the case that lots of people in countries like the UK or Ireland would run out and start importing hand guns en masse?\n\nI can‚Äôt speak for anyone else, but for myself I know that I have zero interest in owning a gun. If they were fully legal tomorrow, that wouldn‚Äôt change. I think a lot of people who grow up in a country without guns would probably feel the same way. \n\nIt‚Äôs also important to take a holistic view of the mission of anarchism. I‚Äôve never encountered an anarchist who advocates for repealing all gun laws by itself, as a single issue. Just like people who call for the abolishment of the police aren‚Äôt saying ‚Äúabolish the police but leave everything else exactly as it is now‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think many anarchists would be cool with the idea of removing all gun control measures without also addressing the underlying causes that contribute to widespread gun violence. (‚ÄúNo gun control but everything else stays the same‚Äù is much more of a right-libertarian mindset).\n\nAnd about ‚Äúfinding your people‚Äù, one thing I love about anarchist spaces is that unlike many other leftist communities, people here don‚Äôt tend to excommunicate you for deviating from orthodoxy (the people against hierarchy and centralization of power don‚Äôt act like petty dictators, who‚Äôd have guessed). \n\nI‚Äôve seen many members of this sub state that they like the ideals of anarchism but aren‚Äôt sure if ‚Äúpure‚Äù anarchy would actually work practically, and that doesn‚Äôt seem to be a controversial stance. So don‚Äôt worry, people aren‚Äôt going to drum you out of the community if you don‚Äôt uncritically accept all the tenets of anarchism.', 'Guns will never not exist. That pandora box has been opened. Anyone with access to basic tools and knowledge can create them. And that\'s not even mentioning 3d printing...\n\nThat said, regarding guns and ""guns violence"" : \nI see it as a red herring. We often talk about the violence caused by a few citizens doing violence with their weapons. But we seldom discuss the harm the guns held by the state do, whether it be killings by the agents of the state or the people our armies kill across the world. Yet, this is where there is the greatest need for a kind of ""control"". We, the people, ought to control what the state is doing with its guns. \n\nAnd on an ideological level, it makes sense that people have access to firearms and that restrictions on their possession be lowered to the minimum. While I still think there ought to be a minimum of control (violently mentally ill people, minors, etc. should not have access to them), I am against gun grabbers and even more against gun grabbers from the left. \n\nFinally, I think a lot of the issues we ascribe to firearms have social causes. Even in Europe. When you read historical accounts from before the current era (let\'s say, prior to WW2), there are often mention of people casually owning firearms. However, ""gun violence"" was not really prevalent back then. Even though they were more easily accessible. The ""guns bad"" mentality didn\'t exist yet.\n\n---\n\n**TL ; DR** : Gun control is at best a non-solution to a non-problem, and I think anarchism is not compatible with gun control in the liberal sense.', ""We wouldn't even be talking about Gun Control if we'd ever nipped white supremacy in the bud and did Reconstruction properly after the Civil War, instead we put former Confederates in power and introduced Slavery with extra steps."", 'From the Floridian anarchist, when the hurricanes come through and the law can‚Äôt help, we all act accordingly if not friendlier.

It would be hell, and I\'d be terrified to go outside.\n\nWhy? Why would you feel this way? I live in the US, in a big city, in an area many white people would consider a ""bad"" part of town, and I\'m not terrified of guns. Cops showing up is a bigger danger.\n\nThe thing is, you are (in the  US) extremely unlikely to be a victim of ""random"" gun violence. Even with the mass shooting ""epidemic"", it\'s mostly media hype. Gun deaths, overwhelmingly, fall in one of two categories - suicides (and it\'s not even close) and gang violence (meaning, if you\'re not the crew in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - or selling weed to them - you aren\'t being shot at).\n\nGuns are just tools. They aren\'t scary things - people are what make guns dangerous. So if the people around you aren\'t dangerous to you, they don\'t suddenly become dangerous if they have a gun.\n\nI grew up in a suburban area, and absorbed many of the attitudes towards guns held by American liberals. Living in a rural area is what showed me that they really are tools with many uses. Where I lived there, the sheriff\'s office would be at least 30 minutes away in an emergency, which also meant if there \\*was\\* a problem, I would have to deal with it myself, *even if* I thought cops were useful. It wasn\'t hard then to shed myself of the liberal attitudes.', 'There is a few layers to it. \n\nIn a revolution we would support the right of workers to take up arms in self defence of the pickets, but this doesn‚Äôt mean that a struggle against gun control is liberatory. \n\nBut a revolution is never going to be legal, so opposing gun control honestly isn‚Äôt a left strategy aiming to legalise the arming of revolutionary forces. It‚Äôs more about allowing the petty bourgeoisie to accumulate weaponry, so that fascists can attack workers.\n\nIt also fundamentally isn‚Äôt going to be the prevailing question in conflict with the state during class conflict. The police are going to be able to accumulate more and better guns (and armour) than either revolutionary unionists or petty bourgeois white supremacists.\n\nThe decisive question is more going to be how many workers walk away from the military in such times, and how much economic power the unionists are willing to flex. This should ultimately see us as taking a position that restrictions on gun use are not of concern, and that the more significant debate is whether we accept that violence will be unavoidable should you end up in a revolutionary civil war.\n\nToo many people get derailed into a free market type debate, rather than seeing it as about the practicalities of what it would mean to be in the kinds of situations that leftists are experiencing in the Middle East.', ""The idea that a sudden erasure of gun control laws would lead to (pun intended) anarchy, is ultimitely illogical.

CMV: There is no argument that would convince gun control opponents that America's gun culture is a problem,"I dont live in the US but because I live in a western, English speaking country, I see a lot of American cultural debates. Afaik, the debate around guns is almost unique because no other country has Americas gun culture. Countries in civil wars aren't as saturated with guns as America. Therefore I don't think the rules of normal debates apply to guns in America. A tweet from a few years back argued that Sandy Hook ""marked the end of the US gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over"". I think this is right and the ""debate"" is mostly over, if it ever really existed.

Regardless of any level of gun violence or any argument that's made, gun control opponents refuse to budge and view it as anything other than a black and white issue. Regardless of how many suicides, murders, accidental deaths or mass shootings there are, the idea that anything should change around guns in America is completely rejected.

I don't think this is the fault of gun control supporters in America. I just think that their opponents have a religious level of belief in guns and won't budge regardless of how many deaths there are.

They don‚Äôt like that police need probable cause to search people‚Äôs persons or effects and that if a search done without probable cause turns up evidence that 100% proves that the person they searched committed a crime, any crime (even murder), that that evidence can not be used in trial against that person.  They would point to known murderers and rapists being let go ‚Äúon technicalities‚Äù and going on to rape and murder again.  Would it matter how many murderers and rapists were being let go and murdering and raping again to you?

I hope not.  \n\nLet‚Äôs go to a more realistic example.  The rise of fake news, inflammatory news, and people sharing inflammatory news has led to a serious problem in the US with misinformation and political divide.  You could reasonably argue it led to tens of thousands if not even hundreds of thousands of extra deaths from covid.  It is, quite literally, a threat to out democracy.

Again, I hope you answer this question in the negative. \n\nHaving individual rights comes with certain problems that are inherent in how these rights work and how they restrict the tools government has to deal with problems.  That is the price of freedom.  There are certainly countries where the people give up individual liberties when problems arise so that government can more easily and more effectively tackle those problems. Those countries eventually turn into authoritarian hellholes.  \n\nIt is no different, in my view, when it comes to the 2nd amendment.  Guns are the great equalizer.  Every human has a right to self defense.  And in my view that also means every human has the right to the proper tools for self defense (you can of course lose rights through due process of law).  People do not need to be athletes and martial art experts to have a decent chance at defending themselves or their family.  The weak should not just be expected to have no defense when attacked by the strong.  The people must have the ability to tell their government ‚Äúno‚Äù.  They must have some kind of *real power* to do that, not just words on paper that give power only because the government allows it to be so.  A well armed and well trained population has *real power* to tell its government ‚Äúno‚Äù, whether the government allows it or not.  Restrictions that make it much more difficult to get guns, get ammo, train with guns, severely limit the type of guns you can get, etc. , are all restrictions that remove that power from the people.  History is too replete with examples of government turning on its people in a brutal and authoritarian way, and the people having no real means to fight back.  The Tiananmen Square Massacre is a great example of this.  The Holocaust, another.  Stalin‚Äôs rule of terror, yet another.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt think gun violence is a problem.   It‚Äôs that I think that the government must address this problem *within the confines of the US constitution*, just like it addressed any other problem.  Gun control is just easy political points for people who don‚Äôt know jack shit about guns and are all too happy to be nannied by the government.  But it doesn‚Äôt get at the root of the issue, which is what high level policy choices led us here (namely drug prohibition, the war on drugs, a history of racism, and ‚Äútough on crime policies‚Äù).  Reversing the effects of those high level policies would, realistically, take decades.  The average voter just does not have that kind of attention span.  They want everything ‚Äúnow now now‚Äù, and it‚Äôs all based on fear and ignorance.  Just like the introduction of drug prohibition and the drug war was based on fear and ignorance (and racism).  And yet we still haven‚Äôt learned.', ""Ok, I want to dispell a few myths I've been seeing crop up here.\n\n   1. We already have background checks. If you're a felon, no gun for you. If you want to buy a gun, you are legally required to go through a background check. There are no loopholes, just people breaking the law, and people not enforcing it properly.\n\n   2. (The following is not to minimize the tragedy of, and the suffering that comes with loosing a child or witnessing a shooting at your school. It is simply giving context) Many seem to be under the impression that school shootings are the majority of gun violence here in the States. This is not true. Most deaths from gun violence occur in intercity gang violence, and domestic shootings elsewhere. School shootings, and really mass shootings in general, actually only make up about 10% of gun violence in the country.\n\n   3. Many firearms used in mass shootings were obtained illegally, and if they weren't, the shooter often had nothing in their past to suggest their future actions. If a monster wishes to do harm, make the gun illegal won't stop them.\n\n   4. While banning guns may drop gun violence, it will increase violence in general. We've seen this in the UK. Yes, no more shootings, but stabbings, and assaults increase to new heights(though to be fair different cultures exist in these countries and are likely the most responsible). If there are no guns, the school shooter will just get a knife.\n\n   5. Many have said, or implied, that gun owners don't care when innocent people are shot. They do. We all do. We merely disagree with how to fix the issue. \n   This is why issues like this, abortion, racial discrimination, and gender equality continue to be issues. No one talks, they just call the other guy a monster. If we were to leave insults at the door, grow thicker skin, and talk to each other like adults, we could probably fix most of these issues in a heartbeat. But we don't. We act like children who want the last cookie. All this will lead to is further division, and most likely, even more death."", ""You are misrepresenting the views of people who refuse to budge on gun control.

These are valid reasons for wanting to keep guns despite the fact you and others disagree.  \n\nYou think they should compromise which is reasonable but gun owners do not trust progressives to stop at a small steps. They know that many progressive want to ban guns and believe than any compromise would lead to demands for ever increasing restrictions. \n\nTo sum it up.\n1) They want guns for valid reasons.\n2) They see problems with guns but think the benefits outweigh the cost.\n3) They refuse budge because they know progressives want to ban guns and any gun control is a step towards banning guns entirely."", ""I think it's the other way around. The facts simply don't support what you say and I'll give you many examples as to why gun control is BS. All we need to do is break down the data. Maybe you never heard these arguments before.\n\nEveryone in America needs to follow the gun laws in their local area. We can see that regardless of the area, each demographic commits gun crime at far different rates. Men and women perhaps the biggest, Men commit FAR more gun crime than women do despite following the same gun laws. Whites commit more gun crime than Asians, Hispanics commit more gun crime than whites, blacks commit gun crime more than Hispanics. 21yr Olds commit more gun crime than 51yr Olds. If it were gun control than these statistics would be even. But clearly there's a much different problem it's the people not the guns.\n\nIf we go back in time when some European country's had similar gun laws to America, European country's still virtually saw no gun crime. Compare the city of London to NYC. Same exact gun laws back in the 50s, the 2 were the exact same. London saw virtually no gun crime. NYC so a lot more.\n\nWhich brings us over to the time line of gun crime. In the 60s the gun crime started to rise and got worse and worse until the late 80s to early 90s when it peaked. It started decreasing since the early 90s. All of which fell under the same gun control laws. \n\nMore guns are in circulation now in 2023 than in the late 80s, far more. But we experience far less gun crime despite guns being much easier to get and more guns being in circulation. I can just refute gun control all day long. \n\nWe see in the United States that gun crime varies and that some of our most heavily gun regulated areas have some of the worst gun crime. Which brings us back to country vs country. Brazil and Russia have much stricter gun laws than the United States but experience much higher levels of gun crime. Even in terms of class, the Asian lower class commits less gun crime than the black middle class. America is the richest country on Earth, our lower class is the upper class of the planet. But we don't experience the lowest levels of crime so it's not a poverty issue and to refute that again we see that gun crime was worse in the 90s despite being much richer in the 90s compared to the 50s.\n\nGuns save a lot of lives too through deterrence and self defense. You use them to hunt and have recreational activities with them. They're used to protect us against government tyranny. \n\nILLEGAL handguns commit the vast majority of crime. So why go after the guns that have almost nothing to do with crime? It makes no sense. \n\nYour kids have a better chance at being struck by lightening than dying from a legally purchased firearm. I know you see someone kill a few kids, it's all over the media and you think this is happening like crazy over here. It's not. You're far more likely to die during a car accident than shot by a gun by an extremely large margin. \n\nLook at the war on drugs here. Look at prohibition. Not only does it not work but it makes things worse. You want the black market to open up and all the fun things that come out of there? People will get the guns anyway. Same with heroin in illegal and people still get their hands on that easily. It's pointless. \n\nPeople cherry pick and like to compare America to some country's in Europe that already had a low level of gun crime even when guns were legalized. They base everything off that and leave all other data out. This is either confirmation bias or the dunning Kruger affect, you don't know what you don't know.

This ""gun culture"" is not contributing to any societal problems. \n\nIn this country we have things called constitutional rights. They can\'t be violated. Guns are one of those rights. That\'s the end of the story unless you can get enough support to amend the Constitution. \n\nWe did have a history of oppression in the name of safety. The case of Dred Scott said that black people shouldn\'t be recognized as citizens or it would cause a whole host of negative societal issues.

So it\'s not a question of necessarily changing our minds but it\'s a case of the two ideas you find contradictory being held by reasonable people.\n\nThe US is on an extremely dangerous trajectory right now. Violence against marginalized people is on the rise and the rhetoric is at utterly insane levels. The police generally don\'t give a shit about these communities and not infrequently the people committing this sort of violence are off duty cops or very close to them. These communities are already at a high level of risk and I\'m afraid it\'s going continue to rise to some very, very dangerous levels. If the cops won\'t protect these communities, who will? Gun control historically has effected these communities disproportionately and many, especially black, Asian and LGBTQ have been arming themselves at a fairly high rate since 2016 but it\'s still far behind the far-right. Of course that\'s not to say any of those communities are in lockstep of course, that would be silly, but there are large portions who are arming themselves. In this climate I\'m skeptical of sweeping measures like assault weapon bans because the far-right is already heavily armed. If they weren\'t and the police weren\'t I\'d be more ok with it but none of those are the case. We don\'t get to choose the world we live in.\n\nSo what are these people doing with these guns?

Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over"".\n\nSandy Hook was in 2012 and one of the more recent widely reported massacre. If you do a search, it won\'t take too much effort to find similar stories that go back decades. The only difference between those stories and Sandy Hook is that we have many more media channels (including various discussion boards and social media type places) to spread the news much wider and much quicker.\n\nThere was an interview with the journalists who uncovered all the Nixon stuff that eventually caused him to resign (to not go through the impeachment and senate trial process). They were asked about today\'s media (I think Twitter was mentioned) and they said that their stories would\'ve unfolded much much quicker.\n\n> I think this is right and the ""debate"" is mostly over, if it ever really existed.\n\nYou should look up the Columbine shooting coverage (which interestingly enough was supposed to be a bombing with guns being used to kill people who were running from the blasts, but the bombs never went off). I believe that was the first mass murder that received such wide coverage. There is also a theory of media contagion effect playing into this (one of the reasons why suicides aren\'t usually reported on the news and why there are studies showing that there was an increase in suicides in the few months after Robin Williams\' suicide was reported on).\n\n> Regardless of any level of gun violence or any argument that\'s made, gun control opponents refuse to budge and view it as anything other than a black and white issue. Regardless of how many suicides, murders, accidental deaths or mass shootings there are, the idea that anything should change around guns in America is completely rejected.\n\nThe issue I take with this viewpoint is twofold. Most gun control proposals are usually an attempt to restrict guns when an outright ban wouldn\'t work. But the ban is still the ultimate goal. In some European countries, where the general access to self-owned (as opposed to gun/range owned) guns is stricter than most of US, they do not have outright bans to everything. For example, in NYC, you can get a rifle and shotgun permit which takes 6 months (before COVID19), but you cannot own any air/spring powered weapons (NYC Administrative code 10-131, if you are interested). Under many assault weapon bans, even some of the types of guns used for international shooting competitions are illegal (because magazine doesn\'t get inserted into the grip). Then we look at countries that have registrations (like Canada) and when someone smuggles guns across the border (another issue) that wouldn\'t be legal anyway, guns still get restricted there even more.', 'History has shown that the NRA faction will support gun control if they feel it will be applied in a racist manner or will be applied more harshly towards minorities.

After my Father passed (suicide by gun), I made no effort to take over his guns and allowed the police to take my guns as well, so I haven't had guns in my home for twenty years.   \n\nI reflect now, that due to stresses in my personal life, had I had guns - I would either have ended up in jail for shooting some of my neighbors dogs, or I would have taken my life by gun. Whichever came first. So for me, personally, even though I could have, having guns would have been a bad idea - but I recognized that and self regulated. \n\nInterestingly though, I was unfortunate to find myself trapped in bad 'elitist' private schools where teachers and the entire system were exploiting, damaging, the children in horrifying ways which proved impossible to bring to light and I was obliged as a child to strategize using guns (I had access to!) to murder some predatory teachers and bring the hidden problem out in the open - of course it would have cost me my life, but the point is I was on the margin of becoming a school 'mass' shooter as a solution to a real world problem and I'm a profoundly talented strategist that goes calm in intense situations so it is likely I would have done an awful lot of damage before I got taken down which would have taken hours given the response times in the arena I was in. \n\nOf course I never did it and if I had gone the violent route there were more effective ways available to me (explosive devices, poisons etc) - but through consideration of guns as a solution I came to understand the problem with guns, they get a power over people, it is as if the 'want' to be used and it is just too easy for guns to be used as a quick solution in an 'in the moment' circumstance (like shooting my neighbors dog on the night I finally can't take it anymore). \n\nI don't consider the argument for and against guns to really be about guns - it is about social environment and the pressures contained within. If people have realistic protection from the kind of threat that may cause them to need to consider retaliation, then having no gun control is going to be dangerous. Getting illegal weapons is always possible, but at least there is a time period for reconsideration between getting overly stressed and snapping and going and seeking a weapon - having guns immediately available just makes it too easy. \n\nIn addition, people appear to have become confused about the realities of what happens when bullets start flying - I noticed that when the US NRA and anti-gun control advocates make arguments about supposedly sensible civilians and police bearing arms to protect society, they tend to make 'perfect' scenario arguments that assume that 'bad guy/gal become public danger, the good guy/gal citizens get their guns out and shoot the baddies' - in the real world, very few people are going to be accurate or circumspect. Furthermore sidearms (which I'm useless with, they're cool to hold and play with, but not really effective) and are only really accurate to use at suicide distances. Every bullet in the air is another bullet that can harm innocent bystanders and people who think they are brave and heroic and would carry guns out of a need to 'protect' society tend to be the same people who would panic and start spraying bullets around - personally I wouldn't want to be carrying a gun, because I know I would never survive harming an innocent (and the 'bad' guys probably qualify as being socially sick, which my personality treats as 'innocent though dangerous'). \n\nFurther interestingly, I worked as a contractor for private security companies in Iraq and Afghanistan for about five years over a decade ago (desk jockey and strategic management roles so I didn't carry guns, though I could have, left that to the security operatives excepting for one contract where I kept an AK beside my bed - the zone I was in was too exposed, I had no choice). So I got to be in an environment where pretty much everybody carried guns with high expectation that they may need to use them - what caught me most is the effect on the people I worked with who did end up in firefights and put insurgents down, it hurt them, *badly.* Could see it in their eyes, their body language, hear it in their voices - terrible, terrible pain. And these were trained ex-military operatives of high standard in justifiable shootings in a war zone and taking a life tore them to pieces and gave them a cancer on their soul that will never wash out. \n\n*But my personal take on the gun control argument in the US - it's pointless, you're not going to stop people carrying guns in the US as is the tradition of the country or prevent mass shootings through politics or making new gun control laws or having endless barneys between the NRA and gun control advocates. Stop wasting your time on it and give the time toward overarching solutions to the social problems of the human community, institutional abuse and clearing up the confusion gangs of sickening, false and dangerous politicians, teachers, preachers, mental health functionaries and other exploitive business creatures playing with the life of the human community and your gun argument will resolve itself by extension.*\n\nIf the US spent even a little of the time it spends arguing about unwinnable arguments like gun control on attempting to understand the truths about countries it interferes with in a shallow self serving manner, like Zimbabwe, then my country would probably be in a much better place rather than suffering from being infected with other countries failures.

There's already so many restrictions stopping from anyone from buying a gun. Like you can't just sit down one day and feel like you want a gun, and then get one within that same week. It's a long process."", 'So people with guns/permits are grandfathered in but I‚Äôm curious if handguns can still be inherited?', ""Most Canadian handguns were smuggled in from the US. that's not going to change any time soon."", ""Context: Handguns have been restricted in Canada for decades now. \n\nAs restricted weapons they can only be purchased by people with a restricted license. This is an additional license on top of our standard firearm license, with additional requirements. \n\nThey can only be discharged at ranges that allow restricted weapons - nowhere else (including your property) and no hunting. \n\nThey can only be transported (even to a range) with a transportation permit. \n\nIn other words; this makes practically no change to existing Canadian gun culture.\n\nThe Americans in this thread are downright hilarious.\n\nGo ahead; debate any of what I've just said as being false. I have a restricted firearms license.\n\nEdit:\n\nA couple quick notes since this has gained traction. \n\nOver 22% of Canadian households own at least one firearm. There are 34.7 guns per 100 Canadians. \n\nHunting is absolutely huge in our culture. The difference is that guns have never been seen as a tool for self defense here. They're tools for hunting, and a hobby. Our culture does not overlap guns with self defense. I understand this probably isn't what you're used to. We like it. We don't buy guns to prepare for the worst."", 'There\'s so many comments about ""why do you need them?"". It\'s not a need, it\'s strictly a recreational want. Firearm ownership in Canada is a privilege, not a right.\n\nAs one of the miniscule minority that actually obtained an RPAL and used it to purchase a pistol, the process is not a simple thing. Getting the RPAL in the first place requires ownership courses which cost quite a bit (200$CAD, 2 days locally to me), 3 specific references (1 family and 2 non family IIRC), background checks, and finally a submission fee for your application (can\'t remember the cost, 50-100$ range). Keyword application. After this chunk of initial process the RCMP can deny your application. \n\nOnce you get approved you get your RPAL card in the mail. From here you can buy restricted and non restricted firearms. For buying restricted, there\'s still more process to go through.\n\nTo buy my pistol from Cabela\'s, I need to prove I was a member of a registered gun range (different ranges have different monthly costs), agree to a waiting period, and during that period my references will be called again and I think a background check is ran. Should you be married/listed a SO in your application, they will get a phone call from the RCMP saying ""your SO/ spouse/ex is trying to buy this firearm, are you okay with this"" and they can say yes or no to continue or stop the process. I only had to wait a week, the store called me and said ""you\'re good come pick up your new pistol"".\n\nOnce I had my pistol, I got a piece of paper that said I was allowed to take it home, and only straight home. It detailed a route to my listed residence from the store and if I got caught by law enforcement with it outside that route, it would be confiscated and I could face criminal charges/fines.\n\nOnce I got home I had to follow a specific set of rules for storing the pistol. It had to be in its own locking hardcase, with a trigger lock, inside a safe or secured room (I had a gun safe), with its registration documents verifying its legality and ownership inside the case with a copy outside the case, all while having none of the keys to unlock any of these cases/locks inside the pistol case. Basically don\'t have the trigger lock key in with the pistol. Again, if you don\'t follow these rules the RCMP can charge you, confiscate all your firearms, etc.\n\nTo go to the range, you have to go straight to the range and straight back. IIRC you have authorization to transport to the range you\'re a member of from your listed residence without a set route. Just as long as it\'s reasonably direct. No unnecessary stops.\n\nMy point is that I followed all these rules and paid these fees to use my 450$ Canik pistol to poke holes in paper at 15m. That\'s literally all you can do with a pistol in Canada. There\'s competitions but that\'s just poking holes in paper quickly and accurately.\n\nI moved in 2019 and ownership became impossible for me since the vast majority of landlords don\'t allow firearms in their lease agreements (not saying its an issue), I had to have my pistol destroyed by my local PD since selling a restricted firearm was such a daunting process when I had to move in 4 weeks. Regardless of the fact that I had my restricted firearm destroyed, I still have to notify the RCMP that I was moving, where and when specifically. \n\nI followed all the rules. I\'m fine with having more rules, I\'ll play by them. But outright bans/freezes without statistical backing are just frustrating for anyone that\'s followed the rules for even longer than I have.', 'Canada has got to be one of the easiest countries in the world to smuggle weapons into. It shares the longest international land border in the world with the United States. Makes me curious how large the illicit gun market in Canada is I can think of maybe two Canadian mass shootings in their modern history although I know that had that mass stabbing a month or so ago. There is already a decent amount of guns in the country as a whole the American populace just seems a bit more bloodthirsty in general on top of easier access.', 'This type of thing is why many states can‚Äôt get even moderate gun control legislation passed. After seeing this you can‚Äôt convince any gun owner that they won‚Äôt be going for outright bans next.', 'I think many people are missing the point here. The Canadian gun owners are heavily vetted, especially for handguns. They are safe and trustworthy by design. There was no reason to implement further restrictions on them. There was no failure in the system resulting in a mass shooting or terror attack or even a tragic accident. The system was working well as intended.\n\nThe PM decided to shamelessly use the mass shooting of children in Texas, thousands of miles away using a semi-auto rifle (from what I recall) to push through further restrictions on the law abiding gun owners in his nation. An absurd and opportunistic measure which punished people not remotely related to what had happened. \n\nIf you‚Äôre for safe gun legislation, Canada had it.

Gun ownership is considered a privilege, not a right. As it should be. \n\nOur existing gun laws were already some of the most strict in the world. To own a firearm you need to complete a course with 2 tests at the end. To own a handgun it‚Äôs an additional course with 2 additional tests. Then, you submit an application to the RCMP (our national police force) where they will conduct a criminal background check and a mental health check. Only then are you allowed to have a license to purchase a firearm (PAL for long guns and an RPAL for handguns). Which must be renewed every 5 years. \n\nOnce you have your PAL/RPAL you are subject to 24 hour criminal background checks and must comply with very strict storage and transportation requirements. In addition, restricted firearms (ie handguns) can only be shot at a gun range that allows them. No self defence, no daily carry, no hunting. Range only, and you must take the most direct route from that range to your house and visa versa. That means no stopping at the beer store on your way home, no stopping at a friends house on your way etc. \n\nThis new handgun freeze will only effect licensed gun owners. It completely ignores the fact that the vast majority of guns used in violent crimes (85-90%) are smuggled from over the US border, or made from 3D printed parts. Most Canadians are ignorant to our existing gun laws, this new measure takes advantage of that. It panders to their existing voter base and pushes aside the the people who wouldn‚Äôt vote for them anyways, all to make it appear as if they are doing something about the crime rates that have steadily been rising for the past few years. \n\nIt is a complete farce and only punishes the people who go out of their way to follow the law while ignoring the real problem. Because addressing real problems would require real work. Something our existing government refuses to do.', 'Remember folks: No one is coming for your guns.

This is done by household/apartment/RV/ect not by per person. If you dont have a living residence only then can it be done by person. This is to avoid grandpa from having the insurance for the entire extended family. If there is a gun in your living residence you must have the insurance.  Also because it has to be mentioned no this does not include grenade launchers or M203\'s or RPG\'s or rocket launchers or flame throwers, ect. Just a slug or pellets propelled by expanding gases down a tube. No this does not include rifle launched grenades like the ones used in WW2 or any othert technical ""what if"" you can come up with. However something like a masterkey attachment would be perfectly fine.  Update 2A to allow insurance. Accidents happen, intentional crimes with guns happen. Victims should not be up shit creek without a paddle because someone else made a mistake or committed a crime intentionally against them. This rate like many other things should be is stapled to inflation so its always effectively the same coverage and we dont need to have long drawn out political battles over it every 10 years.\n\n\n\n43% of americans have guns in the home. 43% of of the us population is roughly 140 million people. Lets say the average number of people in a home is 4. That means there would be roughly 35 million residences paying say 5 bucks a month. Thats 175 million dollars a month going into the insurance pool a month. That may actually be too high it might even be viable to have it lower than 5$ a month.\n\nEdit: As I discussed below with someone regarding the insurance cost and cost of buying a safe. There could be an income threshold where the federal state or local govt pick up the tab for people who couldnt afford the 5$ a month or the cost of the gunsafe. Or the insurance pool money could be used depending on how the numbers work out if there is enough.\n\n\n\nIf a crime is committed with your gun and you showed gross negligence in storing and securing them regardless of if you are involved or not you spend 1/10th of the sentence they get in jail. If its a life sentence that results you spend 5 years in jail. Safe storage would also include having a different storage container or location for your ammo that also has a different lock than your gun safe. If you keep your ammo together in the same safe with your guns that is a violation of that law. Owning guns without owning a gun safe is illegal no questions asked. So no having a spare room and just locking the door does not count people break in windows and steal things all the time. Guns are really pretty and super nice to look at just like pictures or posters or other things you hang on the wall. But guns are tools that can be used to kill people pictures and posters cannot. Store them in a safe. If you do these things and someone finds a way to break in and steal them and commits a crime with them you would not be held liable by this law.\n\nObviously OC and CNC would be exempt from the safe rule. Also if you use a weapon for home defense you must have it attended to at *all* times. Again with no exceptions. No putting it in the corner of your bed room and just leaving it unattended when you are not in the room with it. If you want to do that while sleeping its fine because you are in the room with it. But when you wake up it must stay on/with you or be put back in the safe.\n\nAs a ***staunch*** supporter of 2A I have 0 problems with any of these and any reasonable gun owner should as well.\n\nEdit #2: I have edited a few good ideas from other side conversations or PM\'s so if some comments seem weird thats why.

There\'s only a dispute about  which ones are so powerful that only the government should be allowed to have them.\n\nOn the pro-life side of things, there\'s a sudden change in the definition of what a thing is, and they want everyone to go along with that. It\'s not about whether the constitution protects all or some of something that is known be fall into a category.

Fair enough. Let‚Äôs talk. There are legitimate points to be argued on all sides of the discussion around the accessibility of firearms in our communities.\n\nApproach the conversation around gun laws as an affront to your identity as an American? We‚Äôve got a problem.\n\nWe need to be able to engage in order to decide what is worth keeping and what needs changing when it comes to guns. American gun culture preempts that engagement and is a bigger problem than any individual law or set of laws about firearms, including 2A itself.\n\nETA I think it‚Äôs really regrettable that many of our most knowledgeable on the subject matter are the first to disengage. Far too often the voices that remain and advance the conversation get things wrong and we would benefit a lot if we could learn from people who know what the hell they are talking about.

Because it‚Äôs none of the government‚Äôs business. There are millions just like mine. Molon Labe', 'Medicare for All > Gun Control. In every way. Anything else is just political theater. \n\nThe only two actions that should be taken on gun control in America are barring those with violent misdemeanors from purchasing guns, and ensuring ALL gun sales require background checks, not just in-store sales.

In Switzerland you can't carry a ready to use firearm unless you get a permit, which requires you to prove need by giving concrete safety concerns which could be alleviated by carrying. otherwise you can carry your gun to a range by transporting the weapon and the receiver seperately (and the ammo as well) each one secured seperately as well. for example you could have your receiver in a locked glove box and your rifle in a locked trunk of your car. This prevents you from accessing your weapon in a fit of rage, without requiring some time to grab both components and reassemble them (which realistically only takes a few seconds for trained hands), as well as requiring a potential thief to break into two seperate secured containers (and to figure out where each is). I think having the receiver on your person also counts as secured, so that's an option as well. it's barely an inconvenience (since you are also required to store them seperately) and it can prevent quite a few types of incidences."", 'Not true.

Pro-gun or anti-gun. Black or white. But from what I can tell, talking to people individually about it, is that most Americans seem to be somewhere between those two extremes. Most seem to think that individual citizens can own guns responsibly but that we ought to do something to try to keep them out of the hands of people who will not do so responsibly or limit the damage in some way of people who choose to use them for evil. We have a lot of differences on what we think the specifics of those policies should be and what policies are effective and which are overreaching.

Do you trust this person to define more laws like it?', 'A lot of very ignorant people who‚Äôve never even held a gun, want to project this idea onto gun owners that we do not value gun safety and training, which is, when required by law, a form of gun control.  \n\nThe exact opposite is true.  Every gun owner I know personally makes teaching and learning gun safety a top priority.  Once a person learns how to treat a firearm, they should then learn how to handle a firearm and practice it until they become extremely proficient at the safe handling and use of a firearm.   \n\nJust like learning the fundamentals of shooting makes you a competent shooter, learning the fundamentals of firearms safety makes you a responsible gun owner.  \n\nPeople who have never taken the time to learn any of those things like to make believe that a gun is dangerous simply by existing and that if we restricted the type of gun people could legally own, that the gun itself would somehow become safer.  \n\nBut the opposite is true when talking about NORMAL and SANE people.  An untrained person with a gun is extremely dangerous.  Not only to others, but to themselves.  \n\nI‚Äôm not even talking about violent, evil, and disturbed people who would wantonly murder someone for whatever sick reason they can justify in their own minds, and then use a firearm as the instrument.  \n\nEven the most disingenuous person who hates guns can see that the vast majority of gun crimes are NOT committed by normal and sane people.  \n\nMillions of Americans enjoy the use of their firearms legally every day. And the vast majority of us agree that guns, of any type, should not be in the hands of violent, evil or disturbed people.  And that normal and sane people should be responsibly trained in the proficient and safe use of firearms.  Both of things being forms of gun control.  \n\nNow you can say, ‚ÄúNobody NEEDS a _______,‚Äù for target shooting, hunting, pest control, etc., but that is NOT a fact.  That is YOUR opinion.  And your opinion is meaningless outside of your own home or sphere of influence.  That is the part that hurts everyone‚Äôs butts.  That their ‚Äúopinion‚Äù means nothing to anyone else but them.  \n\nGun control exists in varying levels in every state in the US.  Some I agree with and some I don‚Äôt.  But my opinion is mine and should not be used to restrict another normal and sane person‚Äôs enjoyment of their firearms.  \n\nThe problem is when an opinion is mischaracterized as a ‚Äúfact‚Äù and then used to restrict another sane and normal person‚Äôs enjoyment of their firearms. \n\nSomething we are about to see played out in the automotive industry when new cars start being built with ignition interlocking devices that will require a driver to blow into a device to prove that they are sober before they can start their car.  \n\nOf course there are supporters with their ‚Äúif it saves even ONE life,‚Äù theory. And opponents who feel that it will only restrict those people who would never attempt to operate a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or narcotics.  \n\nAnd the debate will be moot because someone in power already used their office to codify their opinion that having these devices on cars is the next logical step in preventing alcohol related traffic fatalities since training, laws, fines, imprisonment, etc., have failed to stop people from drinking and driving.  Their opinion being that more restrictions equate to more safety.   \n\nAnd hot on the heels of the ignition interlocking device is the governor to prevent speeding or evading police.  \n\nAnd eventually someone on Reddit will ask, ‚ÄúCan a person enjoy cars while also supporting some form of restrictive devices on their cars?‚Äù', ""Gun control, as in :\n\n1. every gun is loaded\n2. don't point the gun at anything you're not willing to destroy\n3. keep your boogerpicker of the bangswitch until ready to pew pew\n4. know your target and what's beyond"", ""I like all the perspectives iv read through and agree with a lot here.

It\'s arguable that a bunch of these mass shooters are actually mentally stable and just evil fucking scum. I digress. \n\nWe have seemingly blurry lines on what constitutes violent crime or makes someone a felon. \n\nThe ""loophole"" people *should* be a caring about is the one where a judge orders someone to get rid of their firearms but then allows them to give or sell them to their fucking brother or aunt or best friend. Which is just another way of saying ""they\'re still mine and I will have access to them but when asked and on paper, my dangerous felonious ass won\'t *actually* own them."" This is stupid bullshit justice system nonsense. If you commit a violent felony and your right to a firearm is revoked, there should be checks and balances in place to make certain your firearms are gone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuying a gun for the first time is also different everywhere. Here in California, you take a short paper quiz on gun safety. A chimp could do it. You also have to prove you have a gun lock. New handguns come with them. You do not need to prove you have a safe or a safe way to store them. No one asks about whether or not you have children or if children could gain access in your home somehow. You also fill out background paperwork. \n\nThere is no training. There is no gun safety course. There is a guy who would 9/10 times rather not be dealing with you at all trying to support your right to buy a firearm and make a buck behind the counter waiting for the next dipshit to repeat the process. \n\nAs a gun owner and a conceal carry holder: I want to see gun safety courses *required* for first time buyers. Whether they are held by the shop selling the gun or something you have to do elsewhere. The initial course should contain everything needed to teach someone about proper handling, storage, technique and anything else a new gun owner should know. \n\nAfter the initial course, you buy your gun, then you should be required to take a firearms shooting course. Again reiterating the initial training but also making sure you can actually handle a live firearm and know how to shoot it. \n\nHowever, I fully support removal of any kind of wait period of people who already legally own firearms. \n\nThere is going to have to be a give and take, and the main issue now is that the government keeps the stance of take take take and we don\'t want to give under the current circumstances.', 'Me.

They shouldn‚Äôt be an identity or a culture.', ""Absolutely. I've written this out before, so I'm just gonna mostly copy/paste from an old comment of mine.\n\nHonest answer as someone who enjoys shooting and guns in general. I strongly believe in gun rights, personal freedom, and the ability to have guns for defense and hobby use. I've thought a lot about what would actually reduce gun violence and not take away from responsible owners.\n\nImplement national gun licenses. 21+ only, must pass a background check, mental health screening, and class, which includes both hands on competency and legal basics and testing. Fail any one of those and no license for you. If you only fail say the shooting competency or legal test you can retest at a later date. License has a QR code that you can scan to verify on a national registry that it is a valid and current license. Must have a license to buy, sell, or  own guns. The license can have an additional endorsement for concealed carry which would be a course specific for that topic. Renew every 3-5 years; lose if convicted of a violent crime, abuse, gun crimes, etc. Felonies for having a gun without a license, selling to someone without one, etc.\n\nImplement safe storage laws with exceptions for home and self defense. Aka all guns must be secured in an acceptable safe, with exceptions like having a gun out of a safe when you are home, concealed carry, hunting, etc. If your gun is stolen and you did not have it properly secured, you can bear responsibility if it's used in a crime.\n\nIn exchange for bearing the majority of the cost for the above, gun owners would be free to buy and own what guns they want, sans full auto and explosives. That includes high capacity mags, ARs, etc. I would also say that short barreled rifles and shotguns as well as suppressors should be unregulated for licensed gun owners. Again, in exchange, the gun owners have legal obligations and responsibilities regarding safe storage and use, as well as bearing the cost of the classes and testing. If you fail to lock up your rifle and someone steals it and commits murder, you're now an accessory to said murder. Responsible owners should have no issue with safe storage, and you can still have a gun available for defense.\n\nThis would address the issue that many mass shooters are 18-21, address safe storage, and ensure competency in firearm owners. It gives gun buyers/sellers a simple and verifiable way to check that another person is a licensed and legal owner, whether in a private or commercial sale. It doesn't take away guns from owners who can show they are truly capable of safely owning guns. It also provides real consequences for irresponsible firearm owners and those who violate those laws."", '\'Can a person enjoy driving while also supporting some form of speed limits?

"CMV: Gun control is not the answer to America's gun epidemic- Instead, better mental health access and gun education is.","[The National Center for Biotechnology Information reports](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047385/) the three main causes of injury were accidental (36%), self-inflicted (33%), and assault (26%). This means that over 1/3 of gun injuries are caused by people with lack of education on guns, not people out to kill.

Even more, America's mental health is on the decline, and suicide rates are increasing.[According to National Alliance on Mental Illness, nearly half of suicide victims had a known mental health condition.](https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Common-with-Mental-Illness/Risk-of-Suicide) Who knows how many more had an unknown illness. [UC Davis reports 61% of guns deaths as suicide,](https://health.ucdavis.edu/what-you-can-do/facts.html)with only 35% as murder. Even mass shooters like ones at Sandy Hook had mental issues but received no help.

Our incredibly expensive healthcare system does not help encourage people to visit the doctor.  [Nearly 1 in 4 Americans are skipping medical care because of the cost](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/nearly-1-in-4-americans-are-skipping-medical-care-because-of-the-cost.html).

Even more, guns prevent crimes and death too. [Guns prevent an estimated 2.5 million crimes a year](https://fee.org/articles/guns-prevent-thousands-of-crimes-every-day-research-show/), or 6,849 every day. Most often, the gun is never fired, and no blood (including the  criminal‚Äôs) is shed. Every year,¬†400,000 life-threatening violent crimes are prevented using firearms.

Plus, banning guns doesn't help either. [Forty percent of state prison inmates admitted they obtained the gun illegally](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/) on the black market, from a drug dealer, or by stealing it. In countries like the U.K. where firearms are practically banned, criminals just use other weapons like their knives or bare hands. In fact, knife crimes (primarily assault and robbery) and subsequent hospitalizations in the U.K. have been increasing for years. [In the U.K., there were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. T](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42749089)his is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014,  when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since  comparable data was compiled.

This shows that gun laws don't keep weapons out of dangerous hands, as people who are ready to rape, rob, and murder don't typically care about laws. Shocker.

Instead, we should be focusing on making mental health treatment free or at least much less expensive, as this will greatly decrease the number of gun shootings and primarily suicides each year in America. In addition, we should be giving people basic firearm education in school to drop the number of accidental injuries.

The test would cover how to load and unload the firearm, how to clear the firearm, how to use the firearm\'s safety(if applicable), and the rules of basic firearm safety(treat every gun as if it is loaded at all times, etc). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe this would solve many of our problems, alongside an improved healthcare system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I would also like to add that we should do away with stupid, pointless laws made by people who know nothing about guns. Having a pistol grip and an adjustable stock on a gun does not make it any deadlier than if it had a fixed stock and no pistol grip.', 'So, i haven‚Äôt seen this point yet - countering your ‚Äúmost guns are bought illegally‚Äù.\n\nWhere do you believe these guns are being produced? They don‚Äôt just materialize, they‚Äôre certainly legally produced/shipped at some point, and an illegal aspect enters the picture somewhere, through stealing, or illegal selling to people without a license.\n\nIf you cut down on the legal market (which would be the only thing laws are able to affect) you cut down on the supply, and therefore the amount of guns available to be sold on the black market/be stolen. Factories aren‚Äôt going to continue producing guns they can‚Äôt sell legally. \n\nLike i assume you know of gun buy-back programs, which sorta fly in the face of the majority of your points - the police know that less guns = less crime, so they proactively buyback guns people don‚Äôt want, and might give away/sell illegally', 'Oppressive force is the surest sign of a failed state\n\nDrugs, cameras, cars, guns, gene editing technology, all tools....all meed to be used responsibly.  If the knowledge of their use and how to manufacture them is widespread, so should education about safe and intended use should be too', 'While I overall agree with your position, I think you are erring in your approach similarly to those advocating for draconian gun control.  Namely, you don\'t address the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of specific proposed measures for reducing the number of gun deaths.\n\nAs an example, after the most recent shootings there has been an increased nationwide call for a new Assault Weapons Ban to restrict weapons like the AR-15. Putting aside for a moment the vagueness and factual incorrectness of how ""assault weapon"" is typically defined in these bills (the AR-15 is NOT an assault rifle), FBI statistics clearly show that long rifles are used in only a tiny minority of gun crimes.\n\nThis chart from the FBI breaks down the number of homicides 2012-2016 by the weapons used to commit them:\n\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-4.xls\n\nIn 2016, 11004 homicides were committed with firearms. In 7927 cases the type of firearm could be determined. Of these 7927 homicides only 374 were committed using rifles. That\'s 4.7%. Personally I suspect that relatively few rifles were used in the 3077 homicides with unspecified firearm type, as wounds from rifle rounds are more distinctive and more remarkable due to the rarity. But that\'s purely personal conjecture, so let\'s stick with a high estimate of 4-5%. Also mark that this includes *all* rifles, including hunting or bolt action rifles that would not be subject to control. The number of ""assault rifle"" deaths would be lower. Spread out over a population of 332 million, that means the average person has less than a 1 in a million chance of dying to an ""assault rifle"".\n\nCompare this with 89.6% of deaths being from handguns, or 19x more.\n\nAlso note that 676 homicides were committed with ""Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, [pushed,] etc.)"". That means that in 2016 almost twice as many people were killed with *bare hands* than were killed by rifles.\n\nIf the purpose of gun control is to save lives, then gun control measures which would save the most lives should be prioritized. So much effort to ban a subset of long rifles based on cosmetic appearance in order to reduce deaths by, at best, a single digit percentage shows that many proposed gun control measures are driven solely by fear and ignorance rather than careful consideration on how best to save lives.', '[deleted]', ""Most people who use guns against others do not have mental illnesses. There will always be angry, stupid, drunk people. While mental health is a real problem, it is not the primary cause of public violence. *People are.*\n\nIf you want a society that doesn't blow each other's heads off on a regular basis, you have a tough choice:\n\n- Guns\n- People \n- No shootings\n\nPick 2."", 'I agree with you but sadly i think they will go with the cheaper, more fiscally conservative option of just banning guns.', 'Also, as a mental health advocate. People who say that we need better mental health services are stereotyping people with mental health challenges as violent. And I‚Äôve worked with that population. It‚Äôs been rare for me to feel scared  around them. The issue is shootings and mental health are sensationalized to ignore the issue on how easy it is to access weapons. \nI had to sign a document saying I could not have any weapons for at least 4 years when I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts. \nAnd I feel it‚Äôs less of a mental health issue, and more of a person no longer seeing the victims as human. A loss of conscience. \nThink about it. 25% of people will experience a mental illness. So if the stereotype of people with mental illness being violent was true, there would be more acts of violence. However, studies have shown that there is no real difference in the amount of violence within the mental health population and the general. However, news tends to not report on most general acts. It doesn‚Äôt add to viewership. \nAnd it‚Äôs true psychopathy and sociopathy exist (mainly known as antisocial personality disorder), but it‚Äôs been shown for those to seek more management positions due to how easy it is to have that power.', 'As someone who was suicidal and got bullied in middle school and used to have fantasies about shooting my bullies at school and then shooting myself... Im very glad I didnt grow up in a place where I would have had access to a gun. I dont really know if I would have done it or not but I think its possible that I would have at least shot myself with it. I was actively thinking about suicide but I was terribly afraid of jumping off a building, hanging myself etc. and I was really hoping to have a gun to do it painlessly and with a bigger chance of success. If my dad would have had a gun at our home, I feel like I would have found some way to steal it too. Its not easy to keep your gun completely out of your childs reach.', ""Oh good I just saw your edit, congrats on having the open mind and all. Yeah I was just gonna say you're not wrong about mental health and gin safety education, but I don't think this is an either/or type of deal. I think we need both harsher gun laws and more attention on mental health. Both can happen simultaneously, it just needs to become the priority. But you get it, I'm happy you committed to changing your mind if you really thought you needed to."", ""> This shows that gun laws don't keep weapons out of dangerous hands, as people who are ready to rape, rob, and murder don't typically care about laws. Shocker. \n\nGun laws do not work because criminal care about the law. They work by disrupting the logistical train that is required to commit a crime with a gun.\n\nTake for instance the London Bridge terror attack. The terrorist did not acquire a gun before the attack, because it would draw too much attention to themselves before the attack.\n\nCriminals are able to stay criminals, and not inmates, by their ability to blend into the general public. By outlawing guns, it gives law enforcement a much larger window for them to notice criminals before they hurt their first victim.\n\nThe converse of this would be the Las Vegas shooter. He was a law abiding citizen, right up until the first bullets were falling on his victims. He had killed dozens of people before the first possible chance of arrest.\n\n> knife crimes skyrocketed anyway, and now law-abiding people can't protect themselves nearly as well. \n\nAgain in the case study of the London Bridge attack, bystanders affected an effective defense using makeshift weapons (a narwhal tusk, and a fire extinguisher). I can count dozens of items within reach of me, that can be used to defend against a knife (e.g. my chair), but nothing that is effective against a gunman.\n\nIn the case of the Las Vegas gunman, due to the terrain and prepared position, it was impossible for any law abiding citizen to have protected themselves using any of their firearms."", 'You can‚Äôt force someone to seek out mental health services or to attend a gun safety course. You can, however, limit access to weapons ending up in those people‚Äôs hands.', 'Okay. So you think that if someone is diagnosed with mental issues and violent episodes if he has access to good mental health care he should be able to go to a gun show and buy a gun without that being an issue. lol.  \n\n\nPlus. Gun control is NOT banning guns. Just like automobile control, like making sure people who operate cars, is not banning cars. It\'s just making sure everyone who is given the privilege to use one knows how to do so safely.  \n\n\nIt\'s SMH when Americans try to pretend like they\'ve put real thought into gun control and it\'s obvious they\'re just being puppets of the NRA. You say it\'s a lack of education about guns but the reality is that your country lets people who are uneducated buy guns and it\'s ridiculous.  \n\n\n40% of prison inmates admitted they obtained guns illegally BECAUSE you have no freaking gun control to make access to them difficult. FFS. If you had first world regulation of your firearms this wouldn\'t be the case. And you know what obtaining those guns illegally means? It means they had stolen guns that were supplied form all the civilians who keep them in glove boxes and under their car seats. Because your \'law-abiding citizens\' are actually breaking a slew of laws if you actually had adult style laws regarding fire arms and would be, you guessed it, criminals. The ridiculous NRA lobby influenced lack of laws protect the criminals who cause 50k+ gun deaths a year by keeping those laws not laws and those people ""law-abiding"" when in reality they\'re just irresponsible children.  \n\n\nIt really goes so freaking deep the impact the NRA has had on destroying America. You don\'t even have access to adequate information because they lobby against it being funded. Why? Becasue they know if the real information came out the truth about how they unpatriotically destroy their own country would come out. It\'s rather insane.', 'This comment has been deleted due to failed Reddit leadership.', 'Few points: \n1) You are not specific in what policies you are referring to when you say ‚ÄúGun control‚Äù which  is a large spectrum of activities so it includes ‚Äòbanning guns‚Äô but it may also be more involved screening (for instance to certify that they don‚Äôt have a mental health issue).  So if in your proposed solution, having access to more mental health facilities there should be a way of preventing those very people from procuring a firearm, which is gun control. \n\n2) You mention suicides which are much more effective with a gun. And you mention that most people who use a gun to commit suicide have no history of using mental health services. There are lots of resources available (suicide hotline), but they still happen.  \n\n3) You did not mention domestic violence which is a big cause of gun deaths, statistics from this past year in covid show a spike in this type of violence, probably due to lockdown and stay at home orders.\n\n4) while a mass shooting gets the media attention, it‚Äôs all the hundreds of thousands of gun deaths that are not mass shooting related that are the true tragedy.  \n\n5) mental health is very difficult, and unless we are ok with stripping people of their rights if they are deemed to have a mental issue, little can be done. I had a neighbor who had clear mental issues. Left nasty notes on our doors all the time, escalated up to pepper spraying me and my wife. We got mental health services called on him and unless he surrenders himself and wants to get help, *nothing* can be done.

The ban had some effect in the short term, as most of the weapons on the market became illegal. But let\'s talk about the ban itself. The ban was ineffective, in that it didn\'t ban or restrict the **function** of the weapons. It instead banned cosmetic appearances. I\'m going to list the aspects that were banned under the 1994 ban on rifles that could accept an external magazine: A bayonet lug (lol!), telescoping stock, a pistol style grip, a flash suppressor (or the barrel threading to accommodate one), and grenade launcher attachments. *Edit: It must have TWO of these features to be illegal*\n\n[https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-367c2405e45e18be349495f390f55145-c](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-367c2405e45e18be349495f390f55145-c)\n\nThis is an AR 15 that is compliant with the 1994 ban. I\'m going to all caps and bold this: **NONE OF THE WEAPONS CAPABILITIES ARE RESTRICTED.** It fires the same ammunition with the same accuracy at the same rate of fire.\n\nSo what is an ""Assault Weapon"" ? It does not have a concise definition. This is where the issue is going to be on any kind of ban. I\'m going to guess that Biden and the Democratic Party are going to try and just use the 1994 ban as a template. It will be effective for a short while, as all the \'new\' weapons are taken off the market to be made compliant, but it won\'t take long.\n\nI don\'t see a point where the Republicans and Democrats can agree on anything that will actually restrict the capabilities of weapons sold. I fear it will turn into just a political show of the Democrats pointing ""See we did something!"" and the Republicans ""See? We blocked them from doing anything serious.""', 'My problem with an assault weapon ban is that it seems disingenuous. ARs and AKs look scary but make up very little of the gun crime in the US. If they wanted to curb gun crime, you would need to go after pistols. \n\nThe issue is that as many ARs as there are out there, there are more pistols. Also, pistols are less scary, meaning that it\'s harder to argue, ""no one needs that.""\n\nLastly, the reason most gun owners roll their eyes at more gun control is that we can\'t enforce the laws we have. Full auto is illegal, but there is a huge problem with glock full auto switches right now.

Barrel shrouds, which basically reduce the chances you grab a hot barrel, and let\'s you hold the gun securely, and suppressors which reduce gun volume from ""wear ear protection or go deaf"" to "" wear ear protection or your ears will ring for a bit"".\n\nPrioritizing ""assault weapons"" which basically amounts to mostly aesthetic features and ignoring every functional component of the firearms makes the ""anti-gun"" crowd look stupid.\n\nThis isn\'t an assault weapon given the current definitions:\n\nhttps://www.dark-storm.com/dsi/ds-15/ds-15-lightning-rifles/dark-storm-ds-15-lightning-featureless-5.56-rifle-black/\n\nThat makes an assault weapon ban stupid.', 'Nope.

This is basically a FB chain post I\'ve seen for fucking *years,* just more polished presentation.\n\nIt\'s...technically true but there\'s *a lot* of backstory to these and it\'s missing the rest.\n\n**Armenia**\n\nFor starters, ""Turkey"" in 1911 was the Ottoman Empire. It was not the modern Republic of Turkey. That aside, the [Ottoman penal code](https://archive.org/stream/TheImperialOttomanPenalCode/OttomanPenalCode_djvu.txt) that was instituted in 1911 essentially restricted the importation and ownership of weapons that were in use by the Ottoman military, very few civilians would have had them. The Ottomans had only begun to acquire ""modern"" bolt action rifles en mass in 1910 and the reformed penal code passed that year was designed to ensure that civilians couldn\'t get their hands on these firearms without the government knowing about it.\n\nNobody was disarmed. \n\nThere were reports of Armenian villages being disarmed at various times leading up to and during the genocide however there is no official policy (that I\'m aware of) that mandated the disarming of the Armenians. It\'s more likely that the Armenians, being generally pretty poor, didn\'t really *have* much in the way of firearms. There wasn\'t any real need to disarm people who weren\'t armed to begin with.\n\nFurthermore, non-Muslims were generally prohibited from owning firearms in the Ottoman Empire though this wasn\'t universal. So again, it\'s likely the Armenians weren\'t actually armed.\n\n**USSR**\n\nThe USSR had policies of restricting ownership of certain weapons from its inception that were carried over from Tsarist times. It makes sense given the context of how the USSR came to be and the fact that there were a lot of places in the USSR where there were open battles with armed paramilitary groups for a long time after the official declaration of the USSR.\n\nI\'m not aware of any specific decree passed in 1929 that ""disarmed"" people. Certain classes of people were prohibited from owning firearms and that category definitely expanded as time went on however the situation in the USSR was much the same as it was in Turkey at the same period - ownership of ""military"" weapons was restricted and monitored whereas ""personal"" firearms received less scrutiny.\n\nYou did generally have to be a party member to legally own a firearm but there were only two notable instances of ""disarmament"" - one in 1918 and one in 1941.\n\nIf you know your history, it should be pretty obvious why that happened on those two dates. 1918 was in the middle of the Russian Civil War and the Bolsheviks were fighting against the Whites, they needed arms and they wanted to ensure White loyalists had less to use against them. 1941 was in response to the German invasion of Russia and the arms were taken to give to the Red Army to help repel the invasion.\n\n**China**\n\nI have no idea what they\'re referring to by ""established gun control in 1935."" \n\nThe only notable date that corresponds in Chinese history is the end of the Long March when the CCP was almost destroyed by the KMT Nationalists. This is also the year that Mao becomes the leader of the CCP.\n\nThis is another one of those ""guns were never really a thing most people had"" scenarios.\n\n""Rounded up and executed"" is also misleading. Again I\'m not sure what these dates actually refer to, I think 1948 is supposed to be the Great Leap Forward and 1952 is the end of the Land Reform Movement. The total wasn\'t 20 million and most of the people who died during this period weren\'t killed for political reasons.\n\nIn large part, the people who were killed were frequently land owners, landlords, and people who owned businesses and the people doing the killing were frequently the communities in which they lived. Mao and the CCP tapped into some pretty deep seated historical anger towards the propertied classes and as part of their consolidation of power they unleashed that anger and it got *a lot* of people killed.\n\nMao and the CCP absolutely knew that they were stoking violence, I don\'t think that\'s debatable, but that\'s not the same as ""rounding up dissidents and executing them."" This also doesn\'t really have anything to do with gun control as, again, there weren\'t any guns to really control.\n\n**Nazi Germany**\n\nAs much as I love typing vast blocks of text no one will read, Three Arrows already [put this one to bed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfHXJRqq-qo)\n\n**Cambodia**\n\nThis is half true in the sense that when the Khmer Rouge came to power there were already laws on the books restricting firearm ownership that the Khmer Rouge just never changed. The people in Cambodian society who could and were allowed to own firearms tended to be the more ""elite"" citizens and most of them were purged and their belongings taken.\n\nThis included most of the firearms in Cambodia. The firearms weren\'t the explicit point, the Khmer Rouge just wanted to take everything the previous elites had and that included firearms.\n\nMost of the people who were exterminated were never armed to begin with.\n\n**Guatemala**\n\nAgain, this is another instance of ""the people who were killed were generally already disarmed.""\n\nGuatemala had heavy restrictions on gun ownership for decades prior to 1964 and the Mayans were generally so poor that they couldn\'t afford firearms even if they would have been allowed to have them.\n\n---\n\nI 1,000% agree that an armed population is important for checking the actions of a government. I agree with the sentiment behind these but why be so sloppy with history and make yourself look like a partisan hack.\n\nYou can absolutely make the case that disarmament precedes systemic state violence without having to play fast and loose with history.', 'The funniest thing about this is thinking an armed citizen or group of has any chance, no matter how well armed, versus a competent military', ""These are all true examples of where gun control hurt a population that may have been able to defend itself if its citizens were armed.

There are also countless example of modern democracies with strict gun control with no history of government oppression and a low likelihood of that happening in the foreseeable future.  It is fallacious to assert that guns are the sole defender of a populations freedoms.  Free press, freedom of expression, education and a free democracy are much more powerful agents of freedom than firearms.

Read the requirements for getting a PAL if you\'re not convinced on that point.\n\nHonestly, this whole ""debate"" just seems like it\'s being dredged up by some overpaid American consultants.', ""Maybe I'm crazy, but it seems like people are finally beginning to understand how effectively civilian gun ownership is already managed in Canada.\n\nSeems the Liberals overplayed one of their pet wedge issues, and accidentally drew attention to how well our original laws worked/how fundamentally different they are from the Americans."", ""The new rules were written by people who don't know anything about guns.\n\nMy partner was shooting a film and had to talk to three different RCMP officers about the prop guns because the rules were so unclear on what is or isn't a replica.\n\nOne of those RCMP officers wanted to confiscate all his prop guns until he obtained a business license. \n\nSo dumb."", 'You know, I read the bill. Tuned into almost every live debate and followed this bill every step of the way. \n\nIt was a real eye opener. It was surprising to learn just how ignorant the people who were tasked with creating the legislation were when it comes to existing gun laws, not just guns. It was infuriating to watch the people who were going to be impacted by this bill not even really given the time of day by the government. Cut off, mic issues, inappropriate insinuations, you name it. \n\nSo instead of relying on *Canadian* statistics, groups like Poly rely on *American* statistics. The government then imported *American* politics and got everyone riled up. That‚Äôs the only way they could sell this shit to the public. \n\nBy the way, it wasn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúAsSaUlT rIfLeS‚Äù that were being discussed to be banned. There were many plane-Jane hunting and sporting shotguns and rifles in there too. \n\nSo no, I‚Äôm not a fan of the liberals, and I don‚Äôt think C-21 deserves to survive. \n\nThis whole bill was created in response to American tragedies and was nothing more than an ‚Äúeasy win‚Äù for the liberals. Trudeau imported American culture conflicts into Canada and ran with it. Gun owners aren‚Äôt the only people arguing ‚ÄúAmerican rhetoric‚Äù and from what I seen it has only been a very small minority arguing against C-21 in an American context.\n\nInstead of presenting C-21 through normal channels, via legislation in the house, Trudeau just OIC‚Äôd everything, circumventing debate. \n\nNot long after in November of last year, they tried to slip in two massive amendments to the bill which *drastically* expanded the scope of the original bill. Now there were an extra 300 pages of common sporting rifles and shotguns that were on the shit list. The backlash, spurned on by the AFN announcing a resolution to oppose C-21, and the comments of Carey Price, caused the government to blink and they withdrew the amendments. \n\nThe frustration for the liberals began to manifest when they started to run out of time and patience. During one of the SECU meetings, the liberals brought forward a motion to limit debate to only 20 minutes per amendment in SECU and anything that wasn‚Äôt discussed before the last meeting ended was considered passed. \n\nThe only meaningful consultation the government did with *anyone* were with gun control groups like PolySeSouvient. They had all the time they wanted to chit chat with the government and pretty much wrote the bill for them. What about the 2.6 million people who were going to be impacted by this legislation? What about the indigenous people who were only ever consulted about this bill while it was still a handgun freeze? Nothing was ever mentioned to them that this was eventually going to incorporate long guns. Where was *anyones* say in all this? \n\n‚ÄúOh but it‚Äôs okay, because we just did it *after* we drastically expanded the bill. It‚Äôs all good!‚Äù. \n\nThis is what makes C-21 so egregious, It was pretty clear where the liberal bias was and the legislative path they chose reflected that. \n\nFor any of you who support the governments gun control bill, you can *thank* the government for being dishonest about their intentions from the get-go. You can thank them for trying to limit debate and ram last-minute prohibitions in the bill while they thought no one was looking, because that‚Äôs why this bill is having such a hard time.', 'The main problem with the ‚Äúgun control debate‚Äù in this country is that 90%+ of people just don‚Äôt care at all, and are supremely uninformed as a result. I truly don‚Äôt believe anyone in this country, outside of a handful of sycophants, would actually support increased restrictions on licenced gun owners if they understood the current restrictions and situation (or even just the restrictions from 5 years ago).\n\nThe problem is though that nobody cares. If you‚Äôre not a gun owner, new gun laws (I say ‚Äúlaws‚Äù not ‚Äúenforcement of laws‚Äù here) probably aren‚Äôt even a top-50 issue on your radar. You hear the government wants to increase gun restrictions and that it‚Äôll make you safer (even though it won‚Äôt) and you think ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs nice‚Äù and then never think about it again.\n\nAnd I don‚Äôt blame people. I went to a gun range for the first time at age 19, and was astounded that I could fire an AR-15 in Canada, and that I could even own one myself after going through a relatively straight-forward process. That‚Äôs not the case anymore, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from getting my license and now owning plenty of guns most Canadians probably don‚Äôt know exist in this country using a license most Canadians probably don‚Äôt even know exists either.', 'Trudeau told ministers to find 15 Billion in budget cuts by Oct 2.

As well, it‚Äôs the government, so I wouldn‚Äôt doubt the administration costs runs well past 5 billion. I mean, the guns were banned 3 years ago and no scheduled buyback. Not something I was describe as efficient in any sense. \n\nWould be amazing for one of two things to happen:\n\n1. Senate sends the bill back \n\n2.

Many people fail to realize how many hoops you have to jump through just to get a basic PAL license in Canada. We already had stricter gun laws than the UK and EU. I would heavily be in favor of implementing EU gun laws in Canada.

Some countries in EU even allow for ownership of fully automatic weapons and have drastically lower gun violence rates than Canada. This is because guns alone do not harm people, people do. ***The real issue is why in some countries do people feel motivated to harm others***? Marginalized and disenfranchised people of all walks of life have been hit the hardest by this governments policies. Its not like people can cut out eating or feeding their children.

Had they successfully entered my home, and had I shot someone, I may have had to face prosecution (MD laws are weird to me).\n\nThat being said, I don't have a firearm in my house at this time and haven't for a while now (I have a good sized pittie mix that is a great deterrent). I don't carry either (I used to), but in a way I almost feel safer without having one on me.\n\nWhere I live now, is one of the easiest places to get a firearm, whether it is a handgun or rifle. There is no requirement for paperwork to buy in a private sale.  My state doesn't require a concealed carry permit if you are over 21 and we are also one of the leading states of gun exports used in gun crimes elsewhere. \n\nSomething has to be done though. I don't have an answer to what exactly needs to be done, but it needs to happen. Unfortunately, people aren't going to give up their guns, even if the government says they have to (at least where I am). \n\nIt's a sad world we are living in, and it only seems it's going to get much worse before it gets better, if it ever does. \n\nhttps://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-gun-laws/west-virginia/\n\nhttps://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/legal_affairs/report-west-virginia-has-more-gun-related-crime-than-most-states/article_ef0a281a-b2de-5181-8c5c-c7d236ee2ceb.html"", ""How come police unions aren't out there demanding gun control?

The leading cause of death among American children and teens is guns, 1 out of 10 gun deaths are under the age of 19.\n3. Death from firearms occurs at a rate more than 5 times higher than drownings.\n4. Since 1970 the U.S. has had 2,032 school shootings. Numbers that are increasing and becoming more frequent. 46% of school shooting or 948 of them have taken place since the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy in December 2012. (Less than 10 years ago)\n5. School shootings have by some accounts have even increased or at least returned to pre-COVID levels. Homeland Security\u202fresearch shows that\u202fif we ‚Äúknow the signs‚Äù of gun violence, act on those signs we can prevent it and reverse the trend.\n6. Nearly 300,000 children have been on campus during a school shooting just since the unprecedented attack at Columbine High School in 1999.\n7. Improperly stored weapons have contributed to school shootings, suicides and the deaths of family members, including infants and toddlers. Around 4.6 million American children live in a home where at least one gun is kept loaded and unlocked.\n8. About 50%, that is one out of every two parents with a weapon in the home\u202f mistakenly believe their children don‚Äôt know where a\u202fgun\u202fis stored.\n9. In 80% of school shootings, at least one other person had knowledge of the attacker‚Äôs plan and failed to report it.\n10. The Secret Service and Department of Education in a comprehensive school shooting study, found that\u202f93%\u202fof school shooters planned the attack in advance.\n11. In the majority of cases mass school shooters shared\u202f threatening or concerning messages or images prior to an attack. More than 75%\u202fraised concern prior to the attacks. People saw or reorganized warning signs in most active shooter cases.\n12. Children living in poverty ‚Äì urban and rural ‚Äì are more likely to die due to gun violence than their more affluent equals.\n13. About 20% of gay and lesbian youth have been directly threatened or injured with a weapon on a school property.\n14. Black youths are four times more likely to be killed with guns than white children.\n15. The vast majority of individuals with diagnosed mental illness and receiving treatment do not engage in violence against others.\n16.

Then we were told people get hurt and disappear all the time. F\\*ck Greg Abbott and this harassment while we all mourn.\n\nOur leadership failed America yet again. Biden could\'ve declared an executive order and he did not. Our children were murdered and our President does nothing. This isn\'t just Biden. It\'s Trump and Obama and Bush too. They do nothing.

We know they are war mongers who get rich by taking gun lobbyists money. We also know that all Democrats do is hum and haw and do nothing, oh sorry... ""prayers."" CNN and MSNBC does not hold our leaders to account. They won\'t. The liberal media is an extension of Biden\'s White House just as they were an extension of Obama\'s White House and just as Fox News is an extension of Donald Trump\'s White House. Gun violence is systemic and there\'s nothing our media or government will do to change this. We need an uprising. We need anger. Conversations do not work.   \nPresident Biden has the authority to pass executive orders. Trump passed executive orders daily. Trump knew that by passing executive orders, lawful or not, that he would get what he wanted in the short term and clog up the courts in the long term. Joe Biden could do the same. People say that executive orders restricting guns are illegal. To the 19 children and two adults who just died, what does legality have to do with anything? They are dead forever.   \nThe Right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness supersedes the Second Amendment. We as a nation failed these children\'s right to life. Clinton passed an assault weapons ban in 1994. Title XI of the Federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, known as the Crime Control Act of 1994, took effect. This was not challenged in the courts, so yes, an assault weapons ban is constitutional.  \nBiden must act. Prayers and supplication does nothing. Prayer is a weapon used on the right to placate culpability. If I were God, I would spit on our prayers. It\'s too late for prayers. Biden must pass executive orders and let the Supreme Court make them illegal. Joe Biden has executive power. He chooses not to use it. Here are just a couple of executive orders Joe Biden could sign into law today.  \n1) For starters, an executive order to pass H.R. 8 - This bill establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties (i.e., unlicensed individuals).Specifically, it prohibits a firearm transfer between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. The prohibition does not apply to certain firearm transfers, such as a gift between spouses in good faith.  \n2) Ban semi-automatic assault weapons. H.R.1808 and S.736 - To regulate assault weapons, to ensure that the right to keep and bear arms is not unlimited, and for other purposes. This bill makes it a crime to knowingly import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon (SAW) or large capacity ammunition feeding device (LCAFD). The prohibition does not apply to a firearm that is (1) manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action; (2) permanently inoperable; (3) an antique; or (4) a rifle or shotgun specifically identified by make and model. The bill also exempts from the prohibition the following, with respect to a SAW or LCAFD: importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession related to certain law enforcement efforts, or authorized tests or experiments; importation, sale, transfer, or possession related to securing nuclear materials; and possession by a retired law enforcement officer. The bill permits continued possession, sale, or transfer of a grandfathered SAW, which must be securely stored. A licensed gun dealer must conduct a background check prior to the sale or transfer of a grandfathered SAW between private parties. The bill permits continued possession of, but prohibits sale or transfer of, a grandfathered LCAFD. Newly manufactured LCAFDs must display serial number identification. Newly manufactured SAWs and LCAFDs must display the date of manufacture. The bill also allows a state or local government to use Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program funds to compensate individuals who surrender a SAW or LCAFD under a buy-back program.', 'Honestly the kids are alright.', ""Republicans don't care if kids die in school.

If our government has determined  that an individual is too dangerous to fly on an airplane, that person should not have the opportunity make a legal firearm purchase. Due process principles require that Americans denied their right to purchase a firearm under this provision have the opportunity to appeal this denial to a federal court.\n\n\n**What the Amendment Does:**\n\n1. Gives the AG the authority to deny firearms sales to individuals who appear on the No Fly List or the Selectee List. \n\n2. Provides a process for Americans and green card holders to appeal a denial in U.S. Court of  Appeals and to recover their reasonable attorneys fees if they prevail.\n\n3. Sets forth a procedure for protecting classified information during the appeal.\n\n4. Protects ongoing FBI counter-terrorism investigations by giving the AG the discretion to  allow gun sales to go forward to individuals covered by this Act.\n\n5. Includes a ‚Äúlook-back‚Äù provision that ensures prompt notification to the FBI if a person who has been on the broader Terrorism Screening Database (TSDB) within the past five years purchasesa firearm.\n\n**How It Works:**  \nThe TSDB is the broad consolidated watch list comprised of several more narrow threat databases that various government entities maintain. The No Fly List is a subset that precludes an individual from boarding a commercial aircraft that departs in, arrives from, or flies over the United States.The Selectee List is used to identify individuals who require additional screening. \n\nIndividuals on the narrower No Fly and Selectee lists would not be allowed to purchase guns, but Americans and green card holders would have due process rights to appeal in the Court of Appeals following a proscribed procedure. The AG would have the burden of proof. \n\nClassified information would be reviewed by the court following procedures similar to those in the Classified Information Procedures Act used for criminal proceedings. In cases where the classified information is relied upon, the court would have a range of options to protect the information while fully ensuring due process. These options range from providing an unclassified summary to disclosing some or all of the classified information.\n\nTo ensure appropriate oversight and transparency, the Attorney General would be required to report to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate on the number of persons denied a firearm, the number of appeals filed, and number of persons who prevailed in their appeals under the provisions of this Act.

We have to make that offering, out of devotion to our Moloch, our god. The gun is our Moloch. We sacrifice children to him daily.\n> \n> December 15 2012\n> \n> Few crimes are more harshly forbidden in the Old Testament than sacrifice to the god Moloch (for which see Leviticus 18.21, 20.1-5). The sacrifice referred to was of living children consumed in the fires of offering to Moloch. Ever since then, worship of Moloch has been the sign of a deeply degraded culture. Ancient Romans justified the destruction of Carthage by noting that children were sacrificed to Moloch there. Milton represented Moloch as the first pagan god who joined Satan‚Äôs war on humankind:\n> \n> First Moloch, horrid king, besmear‚Äôd with blood Of human sacrifice, and parents‚Äô tears, Though for the noise of Drums and Timbrels loud Their children‚Äôs cries unheard, that pass‚Äôd through fire To his grim idol. (Paradise Lost 1.392-96)\n> \n> Read again those lines, with recent images seared into our brains‚Äî‚Äúbesmeared with blood‚Äù and ‚Äúparents‚Äô tears.‚Äù They give the real meaning of what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School Friday morning. That horror cannot be blamed just on one unhinged person. It was the sacrifice we as a culture made, and continually make, to our demonic god. We guarantee that crazed man after crazed man will have a flood of killing power readily supplied him. We have to make that offering, out of devotion to our Moloch, our god. The gun is our Moloch. We sacrifice children to him daily‚Äîsometimes, as at Sandy Hook, by directly throwing them into the fire-hose of bullets from our protected private killing machines, sometimes by blighting our children‚Äôs lives by the death of a parent, a schoolmate, a teacher, a protector. Sometimes this is done by mass killings (eight this year), sometimes by private offerings to the god (thousands this year).\n> \n> The gun is not a mere tool, a bit of technology, a political issue, a point of debate. It is an object of reverence. Devotion to it precludes interruption with the sacrifices it entails. Like most gods, it does what it will, and cannot be questioned. Its acolytes think it is capable only of good things. It guarantees life and safety and freedom. It even guarantees law. Law grows from it. Then how can law question it?\n> \n> Its power to do good is matched by its incapacity to do anything wrong. It cannot kill. Thwarting the god is what kills. If it seems to kill, that is only because the god‚Äôs bottomless appetite for death has not been adequately fed. The answer to problems caused by guns is more guns, millions of guns, guns everywhere, carried openly, carried secretly, in bars, in churches, in offices, in government buildings. Only the lack of guns can be a curse, not their beneficent omnipresence.\n> \n> Adoration of Moloch permeates the country, imposing a hushed silence as he works his will. One cannot question his rites, even as the blood is gushing through the idol‚Äôs teeth. The White House spokesman invokes the silence of traditional in religious ceremony. ‚ÄúIt is not the time‚Äù to question Moloch. No time is right for showing disrespect for Moloch.\n> \n> The fact that the gun is a reverenced god can be seen in its manifold and apparently resistless powers. How do we worship it? Let us count the ways:\n> \n>>It has the power to destroy the reasoning process. It forbids making logical connections. We are required to deny that there is any connection between the fact that we have the greatest number of guns in private hands and the greatest number of deaths from them. Denial on this scale always comes from or is protected by religious fundamentalism. Thus do we deny global warming, or evolution, or biblical errancy. Reason is helpless before such abject faith.\n> \n>>It has the power to turn all our politicians as a class into invertebrate and mute attendants at the shrine. None dare suggest that Moloch can in any way be reined in without being denounced by the pope of this religion, National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre, as trying to destroy Moloch, to take away all guns. They whimper and say they never entertained such heresy. Many flourish their guns while campaigning, or boast that they have themselves hunted ‚Äúvarmints.‚Äù Better that the children die or their lives be blasted than that a politician should risk an election against the dread sentence of NRA excommunication.\n> \n>>It has the power to distort our constitutional thinking. It says that the right to ‚Äúbear arms,‚Äù a military term, gives anyone, anywhere in our country, the power to mow down civilians with military weapons. Even the Supreme Court has been cowed, reversing its own long history of recognizing that the Second Amendment applied to militias. Now the court feels bound to guarantee that any every madman can indulge his ‚Äúreligion‚Äù of slaughter. Moloch brooks no dissent, even from the highest court in the land.\n> \n> Though LaPierre is the pope of this religion, its most successful Peter the Hermit, preaching the crusade for Moloch, was Charlton Heston, a symbol of the Americanism of loving guns. I have often thought that we should raise a statue of Heston at each of the many sites of multiple murders around our land. We would soon have armies of statues, whole droves of Heston acolytes standing sentry at the shrines of Moloch dotting the landscape. Molochism is the one religion that can never be separated from the state. The state itself bows down to Moloch, and protects the sacrifices made to him. So let us celebrate the falling bodies and rising statues as a demonstration of our fealty, our bondage, to the great god Gun.', 'Soooo, let‚Äôs see here:\n\n1.

The other doors will likely be locked from the outside, but can still be used to egress from the school during emergencies. But this ignores simple facts. People *will* use these doors to leave in normal circumstances. They *will* prop them open to pop outside to smoke a cigarette. In either situations, a shooter can use this time to sneak into the building and bypass any other security measures. Locks *will* fail to engage, especially if a student sabotages the lock ahead of time. Other students can simply let in their friend, who they may or may not know has a gun and intends to shoot up the place. This is just setting them up to have something (or someone!) else to blame other than the gun.\n\nRepublicans love to point out that laws won't stop criminals from getting guns, so why don't they acknowledge that metal detectors won't stop guns either? Do they think someone who wants to shoot up a school would be stopped by knowing some little alarm is going to go off if they walk in the door? Think about what happened when you last saw someone trigger the metal detector. The disinterested security guard meanders over and asks them to go back through it and empty their pockets of anything metal. And during this time, the shooter (who already intends to kill people) would simply shoot the guard. At best, the early gunshot at the entrance gives the kids a few second's warning.\n\nMetal detectors are not gun detectors. They will go off all the time, and it will be so routine that virtually no one will bat an eye when it does.

I am Anti Gun Control,"Federal gun control legislation like the Gun Control Act of 1968and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993) created nationwide requirements that make it more difficult to obtain a firearm.

These laws have been in place for decades, and by now, the evidence is crystal clear. Gun control doesn‚Äôt work. Some of the key reasons are detailed below.

Criminals Don‚Äôt Obey Gun Control Laws

Criminals, by definition, do not obey the law. Gun control laws only affect law-abiding people who go through legal avenues to obtain firearms.

Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws. That‚Äôs why background checks have virtually no impact on criminals.

A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes ‚Äî and the results weren‚Äôt surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source. 

The vast majority of criminals obtained their firearms through other means, including: 

Illegal underground sales
Bought, borrowed, traded, or rented from friends or family
Gifts
Purchased by another individual for them
Theft
From their victims
From the scene of a crime
Criminals who go through illegal avenues to obtain firearms aren't going to submit to background checks while doing so. Ultimately, only law-abiding citizens would be impacted by expanded background checks.

The vast majority of gun violence is committed using handguns, not big scary black rifles. The vast majority is carried out by people who have lived in generational poverty and who feel their only way to make ends meet is to engage in illicit activity. \n\nMaybe instead of violating people‚Äôs rights to pass unconstitutional, immoral and quite frankly illegal laws, politicians should be concentrating on helping lift those neighborhoods up out of poverty, giving the people who live there a *proper* education and not just pushing them through school to meet quotas, and put them on a career path that would help them make ends meet and find success. The problem is, most of these politicians bank on their constituents being poor and ignorant just as much as they depend on generational voting records by the politically ignorant.', 'When two sides of an issue cannot agree on fact, or manipulate data to suit their own purposes, there is very little middle ground or discussion to be had. \n\nAs soon as the Biden administration touted, as fact, that gun deaths are the leading cause of death in children, I knew there was no point in having a reasonable discussion. \n\nThat claim is false and targeted at non-gun owning liberals and independents in order to push more ineffective/unconstitutional gun laws. It‚Äôs manipulative and fundamentally politically motivated and frustrated the hell out of me. Even if I wanted to have a discussion, I now need to unravel the lies and falsehoods spread by the fucking US government before any reasonable discussion can occur.', 'I agree with the notion that gun control _as it is written today_ does not work. A few reasons why, that I would like you to try to address:\n\n- we don‚Äôt test people for fitness for gun ownership. Sure we do a cursory background check, but unless you‚Äôre a former felon, won‚Äôt be a problem. We need to include mental health and other mitigating factors. \n\n- criminals can easily obtain a gun from a family member. We should take away guns from any family member of a person who meets the criteria for publicly dangerous\n\n- we don‚Äôt hold gun owners accountable for violence committed with their gun and we should. If I fail to keep my gun out of the hands of a bad person, I might as well have just given it to them. By adding liability, we would certainly see less gun violence at the hands of folks who obtained the weapon from friends or family. This isn‚Äôt even a restriction on guns! Just accountability!\n\nYour points don‚Äôt prove that gun control doesn‚Äôt work. They could also prove that we haven‚Äôt incorporated _enough_ gun control. Just because an idea doesn‚Äôt work in one measure doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt work in a greater or lesser measure. If I wanted to break a window by throwing a ball at it, and only had a foam ball, and it wasn‚Äôt working. I couldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwelp it‚Äôs proven, throwing balls at windows doesn‚Äôt break them.‚Äù\n\nAnd you can‚Äôt possibly make the case that _no_ gun control would somehow be effective at curbing gun violence. Anyone who could have a gun now that isn‚Äôt a criminal could easily get one. The current laws don‚Äôt make it hard for anyone but criminals to buy guns. So what‚Äôs the outcome if we abolish gun control? More criminals get more guns. And you‚Äôre saying that would be a better situation than we have right now?', 'Gun control has to be a two-way street. If law-abiding citizens have to jump through impossible hoops (try to lawfully cc in some counties in California) while criminals have seemingly unlimited access to guns and law enforcement is lax, there‚Äôs a big fucking problem.

Because assault and murder are already illegal under the laws, *no matter what weapon is used*. If we believe that gun control laws are needed to prevent assaults and murders, then it follows that we also need laws that regulate every other object that could possibly be used as a weapon.

All that tells me is that our legal barriers for purchasing (like background checks and serial registration) are effective at stopping criminals from purchasing firearms legally. Now they have to go to the black market. The problem here is that guns are generally *cheaper* on the black market (overhead for a stolen item is quite low), and we have more than 300 million guns in this country. Supply and demand. Reduce the supply, price goes up, fewer illegal guns will be purchased.\n\nAnd I\'m not overly concerned how these laws impact the ability for tacticool manchildren to play with their favorite toys. The fact there\'s an amendment protecting the right to own firearms doesn\'t particularly move me either. As long as you can keep and bear arms, even if there are hoops and hurdles to do so, you\'re right has not been infringed. Or, if you want to argue ""shall not be infringed"" is more broad, then let\'s have access to rocket launchers and tanks! It seems unreasonable to most sane people, but that would be the logical result of such a broad interpretation (hence no SCOTUS justice ever interpreting it so broadly).\n\nAnd I say this as a person who likes guns.

The lack of prospects for the future makes people depressed, desperate, less inclined to plan for the future and more inclined toward violence. White people(men) are especially susceptible to this because they ""expect"" a certain life based on their parents and grandparents and are the most likely to have expensive guns lying around.  \n\nIf economic security for all were seriously addressed, everything else would largely solve itself on its own.\n\n**Lack of Social Services** including mental health services exacerbates economic insecurity. People aren\'t simply depressed, they\'re abandoned by capitalist society.\n\nIf social and health services were available, at least there\'d be some reasonable floor to how ill, desperate, and violence prone people would get.\n\n**Lack of Education** and Systemic bigotry cause people to misunderstand the source of their economic and social insecurity. Instead of blaming the rich and greedy for sucking society dry, they blame favored scapegoats - blacks, immigrants, the lgbt community, etc.\n\nIf our education system actually taught history, civics, ethics, economics, and politics, perhaps their anger could at least be channeled in a useful direction.\n\n**Gun Culture** in America promotes an attitude of violence, ""the gun makes the man,"" ""a real man solves his problems with force."" Gun Culture is why we have more guns than people, one of the main reasons gun violence is so prevalent.  \n\nIf Gun Culture focused on responsibility, safety, humility and restraint instead of glory and death maybe fewer people would go on shooting rampages.\n\n**Shooter Control** could greatly reduce gun violence by restricting access to those who are most likely to commit violent crime - specifically those with a record of domestic violence and animal abuse, traits that a disproportionate number of the most violent gun offenders share.\n\n**Gun Control** is the last and least-effective means of reducing gun violence.

First off you need to be 21 to buy a handgun. This makes it in line with that. Also at 21 a person is out of high school. Unfortunately too many people thinking high school is their world and make ugly decisions to revolt. Putting the ban on semi-auto rifles would prevent any argument on defining what is/isn't an assault rifle. \n\nA second big push should be made in the prosecution and tracking of straw purchases. Most guns used in a illegal crime was obtained illegally. Straw purchases is where one person who will pass a background check purchases the gun for someone who cannot pass a background check. Sometimes purchasing many. There is no real central database or store of records of who purchased what gun. This can be looked as at a registry. Yet if it is legislated right it could only be asked for by a judge. \n\nAnother big issue is the storage of legally owned weapons. If you own guns. It's your responsibility to ensure they do not end up in the hands of someone who should not have them. Many mass shooters obtain their guns from their dad's closet or knowingly allowed access. There needs to be some sort of punishment to set a standard. Stolen guns should be reported also. \n\nThere needs to be harsher gun modifiers also. There needs to be some federal legislation that if someone is arrested and the crime was committed with a weapon or has a weapons charge added. There should be no ability to immediately bail out. There is a major issue in Philly with this. People just going back out on the street. Doing the same things over again. \n\nLimiting types of weapons means only law abiding citizens follow the rules."", 'What exactly is ""an honest question""?

I remember I had the best days playing those pixel/digital games haha.\n\n Dad also got me 2 controllers so that I can play with my sister . We mostly played the classic super mario . But at night time , my neighbour friends would come in so that we can play Ninja turtle (fight) turn by turn (winner stands ) . \n\nAs years passed by , videogame production became a thing and game sets were starting to be sold everywhere. \nSo gradually after 2-3 years of my first videogame set, everyone in my area started receiving their videogame set. \nThe best part was saving up 30-40 rupees ( I guess that was half dollar ""USD"") to buy new game cassettes . \nAs an Indian , I do wanna tell y\'all 30-40 rupees was quite a huge sum for us kids. Imagine getting 2 rupees (idk if that\'ll be 1 or 2 cent or a half cent lol ) for snacks but you keep saving. We keep exchanging the cassette to play each other\'s new game . So with more people owning videogames , getting to play lots of games became a possibility since we just borrow the cassette and turn it back to the friends once we\'re done .\n\n Well we did not have ""save"" feature back then, so if you wanted to leave in the middle, you had to start all over again. Or let\'s say , if you almost reached the end but electricity was cut off , that was a trauma haha. So yeah we were very serious to finish the game as soon as possible. \n\nSome of my favourite ganes were Double Dragon (2P or co-op mode)  , Ninja Turtle ( adventure game but in 2P mode or in today\'s term co-op) , Snow bros (co-op as well ,since it\'s stupid to play solo) , Looney Tunes , Contra , Street fighter , F1 etc etc . Well I had more than 200 or close to 300 games and I loved most of it . \n\nBtw just to answer the post , Yes I used my MP5 to play duck hunt. And there was one more shooting game . It was like a disc throw then you shoot them . \nDuring those days I still had the gun flex of all time since I was the only one with MP5 and people who got their game set received pistols. Idk where dad brought mine from but I never saw anyone having the same gameset as me . Cassette were all the same but the game board and sets were very different. In a way I felt superior tho haha .\n\nI own a laptop now and can play heavy games in it and it\'s way way better than video games I played 2 decades ago but I still believe the fun I had as a kid playing videogame is still incomparable to my Pc gaming I have now .

If you want to actually buy firearms you need to have a gun safe that is to standard, and fill out a form for each weapon you purchase.\n\nIf you applied for H class when you applied for your license you can own semi automatic handguns with a bore of up to .38 and a magazine capacity of up to ten rounds. If you shoot competitive pistols you can get a permit to go up to .45\n\nSemi automatic centrefires are the only thing that is outright now allowed (with a few exceptions, professional shooters, pest controllers etc.)\n\nThe reason Australia doesn\'t have a lot of gun violence isn\'t due to the lack of accessibility to guns. It\'s not hard to get legal guns here, and Aus is chockers with illegal guns that people didn\'t feel like handing or registering in during the \'96 buyback. The gun culture here is different, especially than the US\n\nOur firearms culture is 90% hunting and pest control and 10% sporting shooting and collecting. We have never fought a war on our home soil. (except for the Japanese air raids) Our guns are not precious to us. There is generally no militant or self defense aspects of Australian gun culture. Aussie guns aren\'t ""on the street"" or under pillows. they\'re in the bush, on the farm, in the desert, on the range and locked safely in a gunsafe at night. Most Aussie guns are busy trying to get rid of all of the horrible invasive animals Europeans brought here. That\'s most of what they do.\n\nPersonally I am a collector of antique firearms and most of my guns don\'t even need to be registered or licensed because they are legally not even considered firearms because they are \'Obsolete\' and over a certain age.\n\nI do think our firearms laws are generally pretty good but there\'s a few things that could be amended to make life easier for the owners without compromising any safety. There is a LOT of paperwork involved they could streamline. I personally think semi automatic rimfires should be A class. I\'m not sure how I feel about the national registry considering there was a big leak a few years back and every gun owner got access to every other gun owners registry details. It doesn\'t do shit to help anything it\'s just extra bureaucracy for the sake of it. As much as I would love to own a semi auto centrefire I can see why they don\'t just hand those out. I like the licensing rules, I like the safe rules, I don\'t like the registry or the permit to acquire system.\n\nSo to finally answer the question. Yes. Just SLIGHTLY and bit at a time.\n\nSincerely; someone who\'s been dealing with Australian firearms laws for years\n\nEdit: read the comments. People don\'t seem to realize that the question means ""are the regulations too strict"" and not ""should Aus have American style firearms regs"" There is a big difference. The issue is not that black and white.\n\nSecondly, to people talking about airsoft and gel blasters. They\'re not guns. Sure they\'re banned in all but one state but so are lots of fun things. Slingshots etc. Queensland is the only state that allows slingshots and toy guns / replica guns as far as I know. At the end of the day they\'re not firearms and in my mind, although i agree that banning toys is dumb, that\'s a totally unrelated issue and should not be lumped in with actual firearms.', 'Mate we‚Äôre fine how we are, have no NEED for guns everywhere', 'Australia needs belt fed machine guns in vending machines on the streets.', 'No fuck off we like our children in schools not dead.', 'As an Aussie, our majority opinion can be summarised with two words:\n\nHELL NO', 'They should stop this airsoft ban bullshit', 'We don‚Äôt need to change schools to shooting ranges', ""Nah, mate.

The folly of gun control,,ebf1g7,3607,247,https://i.redd.it/jpqumzyexz441.jpg,"[""I tried arguing this once but couldn't come up with many examples. \n\nCan someone give me some pointers please."", 'You can argue that greater organization probably allowed the genocides, but it is undeniably easier to press your intentions on someone that is disarmed...\n\n1.  Turkey established gun control/confiscation in 1911.  1.5 million Armenians rounded up and exterminated in 1915-1917.\n\n2. The USSR established a policy of gun control/confiscation in 1929.  In 1937, the USSR rounded up about 2 million ""dissidents"" and imprisoned or executed them.\n\n3.  China established a policy of gun control/confiscation in 1935.  From 1948 to 1952, China exterminated 20 million dissidents.\n\n4.  Germany established a policy of gun control/confiscation in 1938.  At a minimum of hundreds of thousands were murdered, we don\'t know the total accurately here.\n\n5.  Cambodia established a gun/control confiscation law in in 1956.  It was not initially enforced, but it eventually was enforced.  Between 1975 and 1977 Cambodian progressives rounded up 2 million ""educated"" people and exterminated them.\n\n6.  Guatemala established a gun control/confiscation policy in 1964.  Between 1964 and 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n\n7.  Uganda passed a gun control/confiscation law in 1970.  Between 1970 and 1979 Uganda exterminated between 2 to 3 million people.\n\nIt isn\'t fair to state that gun control/confiscation will necessarily lead to government running gulags and extermination camps.  However, there is plenty of evidence that it can happen, and even a benevolent government may be replaced by something that is malevolent that then uses such laws.  \n\nFurther, even when the argument is that it will reduce crimes such as murder, no such correlation can be shown.  In Australia, before their gun control/confiscation laws were enacted, the murder rate was 1.6/100K.  Immediately after the legislation was passed, the murder rate rose to 1.8/100K.  It has slowly fallen to a rate of 1.2/100K for the 2008 10 year period along a decline that mirrors the decline in the US and other western countries.\n\n‚ÄúThe most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let\'s not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country."" - Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler\'s Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition, Pg. 425-426.\n\nhttp://www.americanusconstitution.com/gunconfiscationhistory.html', ""If you want recent history, all anyone needs to do is look at is Honk Kong...RIGHT NOW.

If guns have always been part of American society, so have gun laws.\n>\n>This fact might come as a surprise to some gun-rights advocates, who seem to believe that America‚Äôs past was one of unregulated gun ownership. That view received a big assist in 2022, when the Supreme Court declared in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen that the constitutionality of modern gun laws depends on whether they are ‚Äúconsistent with this Nation‚Äôs historical tradition of firearm regulation.‚Äù In other words, the constitutional standard for any modern gun law boils down to whether you can find a good precedent for it back in the 1700s or 1800s.\n>\n>The advocates‚Äô assumption is that such precedents are few and far between, but thanks to the work of researchers and the digitization of archival material, thousands of old gun laws, of every imaginable variety, are now available for reference. Far from being exceptional in American history, gun-control regulations are the default. If Bruen was designed to nullify the constitutional basis for many gun laws, it ought to fail.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Throughout this long period in the history of the republic, up until the beginning of the 20th century, gun laws placed conditions or restrictions on weapons access for a wide variety of citizens‚Äîin particular, indentured servants, vagrants, non-Protestants, those who refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the government, felons, foreigners, minors, and those under the influence of alcohol. Numerous laws regulated hunting practices, as well as firearms‚Äô carry, use, storage, and transportation; regulated the manufacture, inspection, storage, and sale of firearms; imposed gun licensing; and restricted dangerous or unusual weapons.\n>\n>...\n>\n>What does this long record amount to? For a start, America‚Äôs actual gun-law history collides with its gun mythology: that guns were widely carried and largely unregulated until the rise of the regulatory state in the 20th century. No question, gun ownership is as old as the country‚Äîthough less widespread and unfettered than our folklore suggests‚Äîbut so are gun laws.\n>\n>In addition, even though for much of its history America was an agrarian country, a modern nation-state still in the making, with local governments that possessed few resources and limited power, its lawmakers and enforcers were inventive and determined about ensuring public safety. When they perceived a threat to that order from firearms, they passed laws to restrict or prevent them. And back then, by and large, no court struck those laws down.\n>\n>That is what is truly consistent with this nation‚Äôs historical tradition of firearm regulation. So if we accept the originalist premise of Bruen, the actual result should be to render a broad array of gun regulations constitutional.\n\nThe points raised in this article are a good reminder of the nation's history and how the realities of life in the past don't necessarily line up with the mythologies that have since been built up around them. That being said, looking backwards to determine a course forwards isn't necessarily the best course of action either: Learning from the past is one thing, but being bound by the past is something completely different and is something that is antithetical to the idea of improvement, progress, and innovation."", 'Modern day ""Constitutionalists"" will hate this.', ""Let me point you to the National Firearms Act which made Machine Guns illegal to own by civilians and basically ended the creation of those types of guns.\n\nSCOTUS is full of shit, and for over 200 years the well organized militia part of the amendment was respected, and gun ownership was seen as a serious matter that needed regulation to keep up.\n\nVeterans who went to WW1 and witnessed sawed off shotguns and machine guns turning humans into paste knew that the 2nd Amendment didn't protect that.\n\nRoberts Court has done so much damage to the entire nation and it will take herculean effort to even begin to reverse it."", ""True.

HThe reason was, and this trend is in no way unique to Balitmore, that in the specific year (2007, I think?) there were about 200 gun homicides.  Of the victims, over 90% had criminal records.\n\nNow, this is not to say that any of those people deserved to die.  Nor does it prove that they were in the process of doing something illegal when they got killed.  (Though that also means that the \'innocent\' people killed *might* have been doing something illegal, but anyway...)\n\nThe point is, that if you were just a regular person not engaged in any criminal activity - a legitimately \'innocent bystander\' - in the entire city of Baltimore, less than 20 people like you were killed.  That\'s pretty darn good from a Public Safety standpoint.\n\nMost gun homicides (and homicides in general) are committed *between* criminals, for obvious reasons.  And people are freely able to self-select out of the behavior and the interactions likely to get you killed.

And this is why those people and the people who know them don't take any gun control arguments seriously.\n\nAddress the real problem which is a demographic problem.  Stop trying to impose even more rules on people who do not commit crimes and never will.  It does a disservice to those who are not criminals by trying to paint them as such (or at least as potential criminals) and it does a disservice to the black community in inner cities because it's not focusing on helping with the real cause of their problems which is a disintegration of the family structure and a lack of opportunity caused by terrible, horrible public schools.\n\nI should say that I don't know what the complete answer is to help curb violent crime among the poor.

If guns became illegal, of course it won't remove all the guns in society, but the number of guns would be dramatically decreased, so it would be much more difficult for ill-minded people to acquire guns. Also, it's significantly easier to kill with a gun, anybody can pull a trigger but not anybody can use knives or other melee weapons effectively, so successful murders would be fewer. Of course, self made guns would still be a problem, like the shotgun used to kill former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, but they are difficult to create and hard to use, often unable to do massive damage in short time, so the damage is mostly contained.\n\nI understand that gun culture is an important part of American culture, so it's unlikely that a gun ban can ever be implemented, in that case, it's best for everyone to have a gun for self protection."", ""Most people who turn shooter.

(And a lot of shootings are done by immediate family members, often already abusive husbands.) \n\nBy heat of the moment, I mean someone is angry, goes and buys a gun, and kills someone within a day or two.  For instance, the uvalde shooter.  Sorry, I don‚Äôt have a source handy to confirm the frequency of this - partially because the Gun lobby and their pet congressmen have prevented any comprehensive federal gun violence database or research.  \n\nOne of the easiest methods of gun control to prevent this is implementing a waiting period for gun purchases - say 2 weeks.  This would require someone to have a cooldown period and rethink their plan.  There‚Äôs lots of other reasons and methods to reduce gun deaths, I‚Äôll let others field them', ""There's a few factors in play here:\n\n1. Gun control would limit the number of guns floating around readily available, so yes the criminal isn't getting licensed and buying a gun, he's checking out that truck covered in NRA Bumper stickers, breaking the window and looting the rifle in the back window, the pistol in the centre console and the collapsible MP5 tucked under the driver seat. Gun control would mean those weapons are stored in a safe at a secured residence, meaning Mr. Criminal needs to break and enter a home, crack a safe, and escape. \n\n2. Gun control would mean Gun safety, remember Gun deaths aren't always caused by thugs, children pick up unsecured weapons and accidentally pull the trigger, killing themselves or others. Gun control would mean that weapon is stored securely, unloaded, with a trigger lock, meaning a toddler has to accidentally access the Gun locker, accidentally find the stash of ammunition secured elsewhere, accidentally, accidentally load the firearm, and then accidentally shoot somebody, note a loaded handgun tucked in the couch cushions does not afford that safety\n\n\n3. Limited access to guns makes impulsive spur of the moment violence harder. Look at road rage shootings, buddy gets pissed, starts yelling other guy feels scared, buddy starts approaching the car, other guy grabs a baseball bat to protect himself, rager pulls a gun and fires into the car, killing the driver and his pregnant wife. That's harder to do if rager has only his fists. Additionally, how many domestic violence scenarios occur when drugs and guns mix?\n\nAnd those aren't even requiring the confiscation of existing weapons, simply increasing the controls in place like secure storage, storing weapons separate from ammo, putting it behind an extra layer of clear thought, so that it is not the first step of escalation."", ' I thing is just the same as a license to be a doctor or a driver license. You should be able to demostrate that you are not a risk with a car before you can drive one. Also it would diminish the flow of legal firearms tha goes to criminals.', ""I think we should start by finding out how many of these mass shooters were on anti-depressants.  I'm willing to bet that all of them were on some kind of prescription pills and that powerful interests (pharma) are preventing that information from getting out."", 'You‚Äôre absolutely correct. Gun control laws don‚Äôt change anything. \nThe majority of people killed with a firearm in the US are killed with pistols, the politicians don‚Äôt try to ban pistols because that would cause massive backlash from every demographic and would get immediately slapped down by the USSC. \nRifles, which includes the non definable ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù are used in approximately 3-500 deaths every year in the US. \nSo even if the government could ban them all. And then if they could round them all up, which will never happen in the US as there‚Äôs just too many, this would potentially prevent AT MOST 500 deaths. And I say potentially since people who are determined to murder someone will just use another item.', ""Laws on anything doesn't help. Do people really think people that commit crimes follow the law. Look at the prohibition. That did did almost nothing. This war on drugs has done nothing. Why? Because criminals will find a way to get/do what they want. What make gun laws any different."", ""As dumb of a question as this could be, it's really not dumb at all... killing is illegal, it's called murder. Stricker gun laws only help criminals as criminals will still get guns, And the people they rob will lack a gun. Also, I do not see how you could possibly pass a law like that. Imagine you lend your friend your car, and he goes and runs over a parade or some social gathering. How on earth would you be held accountable for that. There is statistics of mass shootings, especially in schools. The first school shooting was in 1764. I normally dont like sorcing .com, but hey, this one seems credible.  https://www.k12academics.com/school-shootings/history-school-shootings-united-states\n\nhttp://behindthetower.org/a-brief-history-of-mass-shootings"", ""My question is, what does stricter guns laws help?\n\nBecause when push comes to shove I don't think the average american is capable of being responsible with guns, so preventing the average american from owning guns seems like a good idea."", ""A gun exponentially increases a person's ability to kill. A person bent on murder will be much more likely of success with a gun. Plus of course guns make mass killings very deadly. \n\nCountries with effective gun laws have much lower rates of homicide, and mass shootings do not happen. Australia had a mass shooting in the 90s, they outlawed most guns and haven't had a mass shooting since."", ""Your post is good. Gun control does not prevent crime. By definition, law abiding gun owners do not commit crimes with their guns.\n\nNo matter how many gun laws there are, criminals will find a way to get guns, and law abiding people will be defenseless. \n\nLook at Mexico. Guns are almost completely illegal there. Same with Chicago. That's really working out well for them."", 'So, first off, there are plenty of stats on how guns used in homicides are acquired, you have internet access and can clearly look them up (spoiler: most are either legally purchased or recently stolen from a legal purchaser). Additionally, there are plenty of statistics on other countries with reasonable weapons laws showing their MASSIVE efficacy and even *our own past when we in the U.S. had stricter gun laws and less shootings as a result* . The fact of the matter is that most shootings are *opportunistic* , they aren\'t being perpetrated by the kind of criminals that would be willing to or would even know ***how*** to go out of their way to acquire a black market gun. In fact, this is clearly demonstrated by the fact that nearly ALL shootings are PERPETRATED WITH A GUN THAT CIVILIANS CAN LEGALLY OWN! If that statement that ""gun laws will only be followed by people who follow the law"" were remotely true: why aren\'t most shootings carried out with military-grade automatics? Why AR14s and M1919s rather than M16s and P90s? Hell, why not *rocket propelled grenades* ? It\'s simple, making something illegal and than enforcing that law like we do with fully-automatic weapons and RPGs makes those things exceedingly difficult and expensive to get so most criminals don\'t even bother trying. \n\nFinally, think about that argument for a second: there\'s no point in restricting guns because only people who wouldn\'t break the law would respect the restrictions... that implies that laws *cannot be enforced* . That ""logic"" applies to EVERY LAW, if you assume that laws can\'t be enforced than having laws against murder, rape, theft, or anything else is just as pointless. Of course, the reality is that laws only exist when they\'re enforced and we have whole specialized parts of government devoted to that. Making an enforcing laws restricting weapon access makes it easier to than enforce all of the other laws.', 'I own guns (but don‚Äôt open carry) so take this for what it is worth.\n\n1- if someone borrows your car and kills someone you are not criminally charged (civil suits aside).

Guns are tools, and they can be used for good or evil.  Someone with good intentions holding a gun is very different from someone who wants to massacre the school, and the former is one of the few things that could stop such a person.

But why do we disagree?  I can delve into many aspects, but most often they all ultimately boil down to a single issue: Gun control advocates overwhelmingly fall into one of two groups, the disingenuous and the ignorant. \n\nNow I\'ll take you at your word that you are asking in earnest, but I\'ll also note that you accept as fact several arguments that are strawmen and logical fallacies.  \n\nAs noted the most prominent strawman is that we don\'t care.  Of course we care, our loved ones go to the same schools as yours we move about the same society.  A bullet does not discriminate, it will behave the same regardless of someone\'s physical characteristics, desires, beliefs or means.  At a base level we all live with the same risk.   To give you an idea of how aggravating this type of strawman assertion of assuming the worst of those who disagree with you is, allow me to play the same stupid game:\n\n*If you support gun control you are a misogynist.  In the aggregate men are more physically powerful than women, most women are at a disadvantage compared to men when it comes to inherent capabilities in inflicting violence on another person.  That situation radically changes with firearms.  Firearms level the field, a gun does not care if a man or woman is wielding it, it offers the same capabilities for violence to either.  To the degree that you\'d restrict a woman\'s right to a firearm, you place her in an inferior position to a man who wishes to prey upon her in some way. So please tell me why do you hate women?*  \n\nWhile the above has a basis of truth,  I don\'t assume that just because someone wants gun control that they are a misogynist or don\'t care about women.  I don\'t assume their desire is to make it harder for women to protect themselves, though gun control elements like waiting periods can certainly result in that very situation.  \n\nThen in your edit you ask how someone can not see the correlation, an example of the logical fallacy of correlation implying causation.   Consider that while the United States has nearly double the firearms per capita than the highest rate nations in the rest of the world, and even significantly more than the average, we don\'t even rank first in murder rates, much less by double any other country.  If more guns equates to more violence and death, the United States should be one of the most dangerous places on earth.  \n\nSo how is it that more guns will help prevent school shootings?  Have you ever heard the saying ""like shooting fish in a barrel""? The people that perpetuate school shootings are not marginally motivated, they have radical intent.  I would ask you how it is that you\'d believe that a ""gun free zone"" sign or the laws behind it will have any significant impact on preventing someone who\'s already decided to break laws in an even more egregious manner (intent to commit murder).   What ""gun free zone"" laws surrounding schools do is take the most vulnerable members of our population, our children, and not only put them in the most venerable situation imaginable, it advertises the fact.  There\'s a reason you don\'t see mass shootings at a gun range or gun shows.  Part of the reason people intent on perpetuation a mass casualty event pick schools, is they have a virtual guarantee to be able to indiscriminately rampage through their victims unopposed for at least a small window of time.    \n\n\nHere\'s your silver lining.  I don\'t want teachers required to carry firearms, I don\'t want security check points and armed guards at all entrances.  I don\'t want every school to have firearms locked in an office.  All that I see that is required to reduce school shootings is to eliminate ""gun free zones"" as they currently exist.  I\'ll offer two solutions.  One is that we eliminate any restriction on carrying firearms on school grounds.  We need not require anyone to do so, we just need to simply allow it.  This will introduce doubt into the mind of a potential mass shooter, it won\'t likely stop them, it will however remove the schools from the list of significantly attractive targets.  So called ""gun free zones"" as they currently exist are anything but, and they are in fact deleterious as all that they ensure is that a mass murderer is unopposed for a time period until law enforcement decides to show up and stop them.  Sorry, but currently ""gun free school zones"" are a sacrificial alter upon which we allow the slaughter of children.  I\'ll again assume the worst of anyone that supports them:  \n\n\n*So which is it, are you in favor of sacrificing our children to monsters to keep these monsters from picking a target where there are more adults?  Do you really desire to throw children to the wolves to save yourself? Or is it that you want to encourage mass shooters to target schools so that you can stand on the graves of children and pontificate for more government encroachment on civil rights?  Are you a weak and selfish individual, or an authoritarian nazi?*   \n\n\nAlternatively if you want to make schools ""gun free zones"", then that must be enforced.  Any freely accessible public entrance must have a security screening checkpoint with armed personnel, all other entrances must be hardened and secured.  It\'s not like this is a radical idea, look at air ports, court houses etc.', ""I support gun control that makes sense and actually targets the problem.

Our government is also banning certain weapons instead of just making them ALL harder to obtain with more background checks.

Mao Zedong on gun control,,91a6y5,2530,357,https://i.redd.it/kni2f92r2rb11.jpg,"['Mao was a villain, but pasted here down below is the true context of that quote.  I could just as easily have cherry-picked this quote from the same speech: ‚ÄúIt is very difficult for the labouring people, who have been deceived and intimidated by the reactionary ruling classes for thousands of years, to awaken to the importance of having guns in their own hands.‚Äù\n\nFull thing which I swiped from Wikipedia:\n\nCommunists do not fight for personal military power (they must in no circumstances do that, and let no one ever again follow the example of Chang Kuo-tao), but they must fight for military power for the Party, for military power for the people. As a national war of resistance is going on, we must also fight for military power for the nation. Where there is naivety on the question of military power, nothing whatsoever can be achieved. It is very difficult for the labouring people, who have been deceived and intimidated by the reactionary ruling classes for thousands of years, to awaken to the importance of having guns in their own hands. Now that Japanese imperialist oppression and the nation-wide resistance to it have pushed our labouring people into the arena of war, Communists should prove themselves the most politically conscious leaders in this war. Every Communist must grasp the truth, ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."" Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party. Yet, having guns, we can create Party organizations, as witness the powerful Party organizations which the Eighth Route Army has created in northern China. We can also create cadres, create schools, create culture, create mass movements. Everything in Yenan has been created by having guns. All things grow out of the barrel of a gun. According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power. Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army. Some people ridicule us as advocates of the ""omnipotence of war"". Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist. The guns of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We shall create a democratic republic. Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed. We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war, and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun.\n\n‚Äî\u2009Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. II, pp. 224-225[3]', 'Can you say that and not sound like a totalitarian dictator?

CMV: Mass shootings are a poor justification for gun control,"My concern is that mass shootings get more attention from the gun control movement than they objectively deserve, and this distracts from the kind of regulations that would reduce gun murders.

1. Mass shootings get a lot of attention in the news media because they are exciting. But they don't actually kill that many people  (e.g. in 2017, [117 people died in mass shootings](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) out of [14,542 total gun murders](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm) = 0.8%).
2. The pathology of mass shootings is atypical. They are mostly carried out by lone individuals who have spent some time stockpiling weapons and building themselves up to carry out a fantasy of destruction against some institution or group. There is an eerie impersonality to their violence: the particular people they kill are just extras in the screenplay they are trying to produce. (This may be what makes mass shootings so upsetting - they can happen to anyone, even nice middle-class white people minding their own business in the mall.)
3. In contrast most gun violence takes place within poor, badly policed, gang-ridden \[Edited to add: ethnic minority\] neighborhoods in parts of cities like Detroit and Chicago. It tends to be much more personal and is mostly carried out with illegally owned handguns, not legally owned AR-15s.
4. Focusing so much on mass shootings makes it seem that if only we could stop (the wrong) people from getting hold of AR-15s we would reduce gun violence by a lot. It wouldn't.
5. Focusing so hard on which guns people who follow the laws should be allowed to buy really pisses off the community of gun owners (who are less likely than the average population to commit crimes). That makes it harder than it ought to be to build a political consensus for effective gun control. \[Edit there are millions of AR-15s in legal ownership but very very few get used for mass murder\]
6. Effective gun control isn't just about laws (most guns that kill people are already illegal) but policies that implement them. e.g. national database of gun buyers to prevent straw buyers funnelling guns into cities, and also better funded detective squads so that gun murderers get punished (some US cities now have only a 35% clear up rate). That's what the gun control movement should focus on.

Edit: Thanks for taking the time to challenge my view. I maintain the broad outlines, but I was persuaded to add a lot more nuance. I posted the result [here](https://www.philosophersbeard.org/2019/08/mass-shootings-are-poor-justification.html).",cn7td1,3069,1681,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cn7td1/cmv_mass_shootings_are_a_poor_justification_for/,"['While it is fair to focus on deaths, it is lackluster to neglect the fact that mass shootings *affect* far more people than any single murder.\n\nIn a public space with a sudden mass shooting, you suddenly have +20 (as a conservative estimate) running for their lives. In tight packed places this goes up rapidly. People are running or hiding, in fear of death. And keep in mind that every person who is in the vicinity of these events, have friends and family who care.\n\nA single murder affects friends and family of victim and culprit. So let\'s say up to 30 people are affected in total, with just two people involved. A mass shooting easily has 50 people nearby, all of whom could be potential victims, and each of them has already been close to a life-threatening event, with or without physical harm. Each of these can easily have +10 friends and family affected. So from a single event, 500 people affected, deeply worried and in fear of a friend/relative\'s life.\n\nMass shootings cause far more worry in far more people, than any regular gun death, also because they are seemingly sporadic and can target literally anybody --- and when anybody can be the victim, everybody has motivations to push for gun control. **The entire event is wholly impersonal, and that makes it only worse.** That you could be killed by any random person, without having interacted once in your lifetime, is a perfectly rational justification for pushing for gun control.\n\nBetween getting killed because of seriously hostile relations, and getting killed by a random nobody, the latter is a far greater fear for the vast majority of people, simply because most people do not harbor ill relations with anybody to such an extent that anybody desires to kill. And therefore the latter is far more difficult to prevent, on a personal level --- thus motivating change to deal with this, on a legal level.\n\nAs a sidenote, gun smuggling out of the US is also an issue that Americans really don\'t pay attention to. [US-produced guns are more likely to kill Mexicans than Americans, for starters.](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/05/23/guns-from-the-united-states-are-flooding-latin-america) And such phenomena ironically cause the ""immigration crisis"" that white supremacists **especially** whine about...\n\nedit: English\n\nedit2: For those who believe that this leads to infringement of rights, an oft repeated argument on this sub, know that the USA is democratic and each state can therefore update its constitution willingly and with public support so as to avoid these legalities, in turn making infringement a non-existent problem. Thank you for attending school and learning about democracy.', 'I see that others have taken different approaches here, so I\'m going to take a slightly different tack. I think a strong argument can be made based on the fact that bombs and other higher-lethality weapons are illegal for the same reason. While bombings or shootings with RPGs or tank rampages don\'t kill all that many people (and probably still wouldn\'t even if those things were illegal), they\'re still illegal, and I think most people would agree that they should be.\n\nSo the question then is this: Why should, say, an AR-15 be legal when an RPG isn\'t? And I think that\'s probably a legitimate question to ask, even if you arrive at the conclusion that there is some compelling difference between the two.\n\nWe (we being our culture, our society, our government, what have you) have collectively decided that there\'s an equation that should be run when considering whether any given thing should be legal for the public to have. That equation is, roughly, the benefit of owning it weighed against the possible damage that could be done with it. We decide, for instance, that owning a fighter jet with full armaments is not terribly beneficial aside from just getting your jollies. Weigh that against the incredible damage that could be done if misused, and you get a very low ""desirability quotient.""\n\nNow, an AR-15 is going to have a higher ""desirability quotient"" than a fighter jet. There are more legitimate uses for it, including sporting, defense against large and tough creatures like boar, and something about a well-regulated militia (though that\'s a whole different can of worms I will not be getting into here). While overkill, they can also be used for home defense, though as the owner of one, I would say that is reckless and irresponsible considering its penetrating power and how much lethality a 5.56 round can have even after piercing several sheets of drywall.\n\nHowever, despite its higher ""desirability quotient,"" there is an argument to be made that because of the increasing frequency of mass shootings, the ""potential for harm"" part of that equation is getting bigger, driving that total quotient down. It\'s not unreasonable to assert that at some number of people killed per year, AR-15s (again, for example) dip below that line of desirable/undesirable and should be banned. Then, the only question is ""what is that number, and are we there yet?""\n\nSo to summarize: We already do this with a LOT of things. Lots of weapons, tools, etc. are banned or restricted not because we legitimately expect there to be a staggering annual body count if they were legal and unrestricted, but rather because the ease with which someone abusing them could cause harm is, in the legislature\'s eyes, greater than the good that is attained by keeping them unrestricted. I can think of no reason why firearms (of any type) should be exempt from this consideration.\n\nEdit: Moved a decimal point to avoid the wrath of the ammophiles.\n\nEdit 2: I GET IT, a 5.56 round is not necessarily more likely to overpenetrate through drywall than some of the other stuff I listed. Thank you, consider me corrected.', 'Tl;dr - political change is driven by public demands. Most of the public can see themselves or someone they care about being a victim in a random mass shooting more easily than they can see themselves being a victim in a gang crime, lover\'s quarrel or mugging. Politicians are using this fear and ""relatability"" to victims to their advantage.\n\nWhen we think of murders, we usually think of a guy that catches his wife in bed with another man, a gangster shooting a rival gangster, etc. There is a *personal* element to it. Mass shootings are impersonal and could affect Larry A. Johnson from Compton as easily as it could affect Larry B. Johnson from Beverly Hills.\n\nA person who has never even *seen* a gun and has no worry of being murdered by a friend or family member can easily dissociate from a news story about a gang murder or a lover\'s quarrel (""This could never happen to *me*!""), but the same can not be said about mass shootings. When literally anybody -- old ladies, young business professional, 6 year old children, teenagers attending a concert -- can be murdered while doing nothing but enjoying a nice day or having a drink with friends, it hits a bit closer to home.\n\nMy point is that people tend to not really give a shit when it doesn\'t affect them. Gun crime has been happening for years and years and years and the vast majority of it doesn\'t even see  national bheadlines. It\'s *somebody else\'s* problem and therefore people aren\'t going to upset the status quo and push for change. It\'s someone else\'s problem. Mass shootings make it *everyone\'s* problem. Not just the people that were present during the event, but the people in the communities asking how this could ever happen in *my* home town. Or how this could happen only an hour away from me. Or how this could happen in the city where my friend/family member lives. Getting things done in politics requires support from the public, and most of the public can\'t relate to victims of gang violence or targeted crime. Almost everyone can relate to mass shootings.\n\nAs an aside, this must be particularly frustrating for the black community. Gang crime and gun violence has riddled black neighborhoods for decades, and it\'s only when white people start getting killed en masse that anybody wants to do something about it. I forget which comedian it was, but they were saying how black teens go missing all the time and nobody cares, but everyone loses their damn minds when a little white girl goes missing. Dave Chappelle maybe?', 'I don‚Äôt just want to minimize mass murders committed with a gun, I want to minimize suicide deaths by gun, deaths from guns used to kill intimate partners, gun deaths of those caught up in criminal activity, guns used to kill in anger or in hate, deaths to children & adults from gun accidents, and bystander deaths from all of the above.  We focus on deaths, but I also want to minimize non-lethal injuries, some of which are minimal and some of which are life-changing due to severe physical and mental trauma.\n\nMass shootings make up a small fraction of these gun injuries and deaths, but if the resulting public horror and fear can help inspire a variety of actions to minimize gun violence of all kinds, I am all for using the aftermath of these  tragedies to do just that.', '[deleted]', 'You aren\'t necessarily _wrong_ about any of your facts here, but just because we can\'t fix _everything_ doesn\'t mean that we shouldn\'t try to fix the things that we can.  Even if mass shootings are only 1% of all gun homicides, those victims are still sons/daughters, mothers/fathers, brothers/sisters, friends/colleagues to people; their lives have value and if we can do something to prevent deaths, we should do that, even if it is only a small percentage of the overall problem that needs to be solved.\n\nNow, you can argue that the proposed laws would or would not be effective at curtailing mass shootings, and _that_ might be a good reason to be against that specific piece of gun control, but ""it is statistically insignificant"" or ""there are other problems to solve"" are poor reasons to not implement a policy if it could be effective.', "">Mass shootings get a lot of attention in the news media because they are exciting. But they don't actually kill that many people (e.g. in 2017, [117 people died in mass shootings](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) out of [14,542 total gun murders](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm) = 0.8%).\n\nMass shootings aren't the only reason that people object to gun control, though. That's just one thing. I agree that they are over-sensationalized but pitting it's percentage against gun murders in the U.S. is actually counterproductive to gun advocates - that only shows how crazy gun violence is with the U.S.\n\nThere's also the mass panic that can be caused by mass shootings, like the current top poster mentioned."", ""There's an implicit assumption here, that a death is a death; but humans don't work like that. Humans react emotionally, and it's never a headcount.\n\nFor example, around 3,000 people were killed in 9/11, but the entire country was in shock and it went to two wars with other countries. Whereas about 10,000 people die everyday in America just in the natural course of things, there is absolutely no country-wide outrage about that.\n\nEmotionally speaking, a death is not simply a death, who did what to who, how they did it, who benefited from the circumstance, whether there is corruption involved, whether those deaths were preventable, whether it was a crime of commission, or a crime of omission, or whether they died of natural causes.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* it was a deliberate, violent act\n* other people made money from manufacturing and supplying the guns\n* people paid off politicians to permit it\n* the event was terrifying to those involved\n* people involved had no control over the outcome\n* most people get no benefit from the guns used\n* small children were affected\n\nFor each of these factors, you could probably multiply people's concern and emotional response by a factor of two to ten. So in people's heads it's not 26 deaths, people are acting like it's over 1000 deaths.\n\nNow, you can try arguing that people are being irrational, that they shouldn't be like that. But people are going to continue to be like that, it's human nature. What isn't human nature is wandering around with rapid fire semi automatic weaponry; that's an entirely artificial modern construct.\n\nOther examples of this kind of emotional response were found in the Alar scandal where a chemical was shown to slightly increase the chance of death, and smoking, where people's smoking increased the chance of death of people around them. In both cases a similar calculus can be applied to model how people responded.\n\nBecause people do think emotionally, no it's not a poor justification."", 'In a sense I agree. The main reason why gun control is needed is that 14,500 plus figure of gun deaths that you have quoted for 2017 in the US. In comparison, the UK had approximately 55 gun deaths last year. Even if you take into account population differences, you are 54 more times likely to get shot in the US than you are in the UK. \n\nBut the reality is that mass shootings should be a great impetus to implement gun control measures. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre ‚Äòexciting‚Äô. Instead they catch attention because they‚Äôre so brutal and so scary. As you said, most people assume gun deaths are pre-meditated and restricted to particular areas. But mass shootings remind us all that none of us are immune to the desires of some lunatic who decides he wants to kill as many people as possible and is able to simply because he has a gun. The only thing wrong the victims did was be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It shocks us all, destroys many lives, traumatises even more and brings communities together. \n\nAnd for that reason, I think politicians should seize the opportunity where sympathy is at an all time high to push through gun control measures. That‚Äôs what they did in Australia successfully in 1996. There was a big community there who strongly opposed it, but the government at the time fought hard for it. It‚Äôs now favoured by a large majority of the population. And rather unsurprisingly, both the number of mass shootings and gun decreased dramatically (in fact there have been no mass shootings ever since).', ""I just want to mention one point. \n\n6. Illegal guns usually start out as legal guns. There's generally not illegal gun factories out there. At least not in the US. Weapons are lost, sold, stolen, or illegally modified to become illegal weapons. Laws that lower the total number of firearms also limit the supply of weapons that would otherwise eventually be used in a crime. I feel like everybody already understands this. \n\nI like guns. I own several. I just don't like seeing this argument used when I think everyone who makes it already understands it's faults."", ""I'm going to tackle your view from a different angle to most, and only touch a little bit on HOW control can help.\n\nI'm going to talk about WHY there is a focus on mass shootings.\n\n1) Regular mass shootings are a uniquely American thing. This means that there is a way to reduce them which involves making the US like any other first world country. It doesn't require new thinking.\n\n2) Mass shootings are a specific type of terrorism that can happen anywhere, and cause people to fear for their lives in general situations because they don't have patterns.\n\nThe first issue would show that the unchecked nature and lack of requirement of training in the US due to the ability to buy guns at gun shows and private sales without any tracking is a problem that most other places in the world simply don't have. Buying a gun in the US is super cheap and super easy and there is nobody that is going to stop you. You don't have to do anything illegal so the acquirement of a weapon on whim is common. This is not normal around the world. Most places have a length process.\n\nThere are other issues around the US becoming more like the rest of the world including healthcare and mental health facilities. If the US didn't have such a shit system then this would happen less frequently. The US also has massive racial tensions at the moment, high poverty (for a first world nation), and the media blares this shit out to a group of people that REALLY want to be famous (since that is a small part of what the American dream is).\n\nThe second point is more to do with fear. Gang violence, suicide, all big problems that kill more people. But they won't happen to me if I'm not suicidal and I don't like in gang territories. But a mass shooting at a shoot for fair? That could be my daughter's school. That could be where I work. I could be on holiday there. It just increases feelings of unease. \n\nHeart disease kills so many people but it isn't something that a person does TO me, so I don't really fear it in the same way.\n\nSo yes, mass shootings are a very good justification for gun control because the purpose isn't just to reduce the number of deaths (which WILL happen, but as you say not by as much as solving gang crime or suicide). The strongest reason is that mass shootings are a destabilising force of fear in society."", 'Even if they are a small percentage of gun deaths, mass shootings are a significant problem and worth addressing. That‚Äôs how terrorism works, the acts are designed to intimidate the general population by making them feel unsafe in their day to day life. There also aren‚Äôt really solutions to addressing mass shootings that are mutually exclusive to addressing the bulk of gun deaths. We can do both.', '> is mostly carried out with illegally owned handguns, not legally owned AR-15s.\n\nAlmost every single illegal gun was a legal gun at some point.\n\nIf you reduce the number of legal guns, it has the incidental value of reducing the number and availability of illegal guns.', ""> It tends to be much more personal and is mostly carried out with illegally owned handguns, not legally owned AR-15s.\n\nThe issue with that point is that there is a correlation between how easy it is to get a gun legally and illegally.\n\nIf almost everyone can buy a gun legally, but you are not allowed to. All you have to do is just steal it from someone (easy, if you can buy a gun without a lot of limits on it, there's gonna be a lot of people that don't keep their guns safely stored) or even easier: Ask someone who can buy a gun legally to do it for you. \n\nHowever if you make it harder to get a gun legally, that will make it harder to get your hands on an illegal gun too.\n\nSay getting a gun requires a wait of a full month, full background check (associating with individuals with criminal background or psychological issues is an automatic denial), gun is registered in your name and you are responsible for everything that is done with your gun (even if it was stolen from you).\n\nIt'd be a lot harder to find someone who would be willing to buy a gun for you, due to the associated risk (he is responsible for everything you do with the gun), they would need to not be friends with you if you are a known criminal, etc. \n\nAnd stealing one would also be harder, as people would pay way more attention to keep their guns safely stored...after all they would be held responsible for crimes comitted with their stolen gun. (those are just examples, doesn't mean I necessarily support them in that exact way)\n\nAlso due to the wait time it'd be harder to get a gun on short notice.\n\nNow let's go one step further.\n\nNobody is allowed to own a gun, unless they can conclusively proof that they need it for their job (so hunters, police, etc can still have a firearm).\nEvery individual firearm needs a new approval and permission. Approval take at least 4 months, intense background checks, psychological evaluation, and requirement to not only do an extensive training course on each individual gun purchase, but also pass an exam + practical test on things like gun safety, etc.\n\nGuns are registered to an individual, once per month you have to prove that you are still currently in possession of your gun. (Again, not in support of a policy like that, but it would be an example of drastic measures that would work to make acquiring an illegal gun harder).\nEvery 12 months you have to renew your permission or hand in your gun.\n\nAmmunition is sold separately. Every single shot worth of ammunition has to be justified on purchase. Delivery is delayed by a month. Total amount of ammunition you can purchase per month is limited. Total amount of ammunition you can possess is limited.\n\nNow in that scenario, where would you even try to start to get an illegal gun in a quick and easy fashion. Just asking someone you know is out. Asking a random person might work (unlikely), but it'd take a long time, no guarantee it'd actually work and it'd be much, much more expensive. \nThe only real way to get a gun illegally anymore is to know the right people, that sell guns smuggled in from outside of the country. That is a lot harder to pull off than just buying them and increases the cost due to effort needed to get them to a selling point. So illegal guns are going to be rare, which further increases their price, since demand is going to be higher than supply.\n\nThat means that your average criminal is not going to be able to ever get their hands on a gun.\n\nAnd even if they do, they still have to go through the same procedure again to get ammunition. \n\nThe reason there are so many illegal guns in the US, is because there are so many legal guns."", 'I don\'t get your argument, none of your 6 points actually explain to me why mass shootings are a poor reason to want gun control. \n\nHere is a thought experiment.\n\nGrieving mother: ""Dear senator, today my child was gunned down at school, please enact new laws to restrict accsess to guns to prevent this from happening again.""\n\nSenator: ""I am sorry for you loss, but today\'s mass shooting and the death of your child does not warrant action on this issue, because gun violence usually happens in \'gang-ridden\' cities so why bother.""', ""/u/phileconomicus (OP) has awarded 5 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/cn8obw/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_mass_shootings_are_a_poor/), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\xa0System\xa0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)"", '>But they don\'t actually kill that many people\n\nThe ""don\'t actually kill all that many people"" argument is a ridiculous invention of the gun lobby, something that looks superficially rational but isn\'t. It\'s a lie of omission. It compares mass shooting deaths to numerically greater causes of death as if bodycount is all that matters, but it omits the key point that we\'re already doing everything we reasonably can about most of those other problems; for example, medical errors often cited but they\'re an inevitable consequence of human fallibility and we go to great lengths to make as few of them as possible.\n\nOther causes, like car accidents, are deemed by society to be an acceptable cost for the enormous benefit we all get from being able to drive around, and we regulate the heck out of them to keep those deaths to a minimum. Still others, like tobacco, are deemed more acceptable because the victims are responsible for the risks they\'re taking on, and yet even those are highly regulated. Mass shootings stand alone as an example of something that kills lots of people by means that are almost completely unregulated.\n\nImagine if a defendant tried to use the ""didn\'t actually kill all that many people"" argument in the courtroom. ""Your honor, sure I may have killed my wife, but she was only 0.0000003 % of the population so it was statistically insignificant."" That\'s not how morality works.

Let\'s do that. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. The people who will vote for that are usually the same ones who will vote for gun control. Oddly, the party standing in the way of those reforms is the one pointing in their direction after every mass shooting.\n\n>Focusing so much on mass shootings makes it seem that if only we could stop (the wrong) people from getting hold of AR-15s we would reduce gun violence by a lot. It wouldn\'t.\n\nIt\'s ""a lot"" to the would-be victims. It\'s indisputable that many people are dead today who would be alive if their shooters had to pause more between shots to reload and recover from recoil. It\'s logical on this issue to set aside all the whataboutism regarding things you think should be a higher priority and look at the widespread availability of ""assault rifles"" as an issue on its own merits. Pros and cons.\n\nAny rational and honest person sees that the cons are measured in lives lost that would not all be lost if the shooters had ""Fudd"" guns instead. So, what are the pros? Not lives saved. These rifles have never been used in a civilian self-defense situation for which their unique ability to fire lots of shots quickly made the difference; a ""Fudd"" gun would have worked just as well in every documented case. These rifles have no benefit for self-defense or hunting, because although they can be used for both purposes there are better options available for less money. In truth, the only law-abiding use for which the AR-15 has any advantage over less massacre-friendly weapons is for playing soldier at the range. That\'s it.\n\nIs that little game worth the lives cost by its widespread availability, especially when people can just as easily play soldier on an XBox for less money? And when regular rifles and shotguns are still fun to shoot? Hell, shooting clays is a lot more fun than blasting away at a paper target at high speed anyway. At least it takes some skill.\n\n>That makes it harder than it ought to be to build a political consensus for effective gun control\n\nThe NRA and Republican Party make it impossible to build that consensus anyway. They will not concede an inch to reason, even on something as innocuous as background checks.\n\n>Effective gun control isn\'t just about laws (most guns that kill people are already illegal) but policies that implement them. ... That\'s what the gun control movement should focus on.\n\nAgain, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Many deadly shootings are committed by people who obtained their guns legally. We should absolutely do a better job enforcing existing laws, but that\'s not enough.', 'I have a couple points here that are not necessarily connected to each other, but may collectively explain why mass shootings bring out these arguments, and why it doesn\'t make mass vehicles a poor justification to talk about gun violence.\n\nOur minds are programmed to pay attention to stories, not statistics. For example, research shows that you can maximize donations to help starving children by showing them the story of one child. Even if you merely expand that to two children (two siblings), donations go down. And they drop to their floor when you expand it to a million starving children. This is because each new child dilutes the story and the personal impact that we are emotionally programmed to respond to. This is relevant because we react the same way to mass shootings versus ongoing gun violence. We hear all the details about each mass shooting, and we respond to that. I would venture to guess that if we were more exposed to individual stories attached to regular gun violence, then we would end up in these same gun control conversations.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point (so maybe they are connected): most of the gun control discussions I see in the wake of a mass shooting are not really talking about reducing mass shootings, but often cite total gun violence in the US. Now, I will grant you that a lot of the *proposed* gun control is, as you described, related to banning AR-15s and high capacity magazines, which wouldn\'t really move the needle too much. However, I never see the argument being framed as ""we need to stop 117 people a year from dying in mass shootings"", but rather, ""we need to reduce the 14,000 gun deaths"". So, the means (banning AR-15s) may be ill-informed, but the desired ends consider the whole gun violence picture.', ""If I was in the UK when the removed Gun rights, I would have been against it, now it's actually in play and mass shootings have pretty much stopped I have to say it's the best thing for our country. \n\nIf we still had guns o honestly think our mass shootings would on a percentage scale match the UK. \n\nPeople like to bring up knife crime, but it takes a lot to kill 20 and injure 40 people in 5 mins with a knife.

So, it makes sense for activists to focus their campaigning to those examples that are widely understood.\n\nAbout the idea that disallowing guns wouldn\'t reduce gun violence, I can only say that in my country where gun ownership is very restricted and noone outside of the police is allowed to carry a loaded weapon outside of shooting ranges, we have basically no gun violence. It\'s a fallacy to assume that criminals are going to be armed and ready to kill no matter what. Arming up on both sides does increase the risk of a deadly escalation by a lot. And while you\'re probably right that any responsible gun owner is rather unlikely to shoot without having analized the necessity of deadly force in the situation at hand, there\'s also people who simply feel intimidated by the presence of guns all around them and decide to get a gun themselves ""for protection"" without undergoing proper training. Those people are much more likely to overreact to a perceived deadly threat than the gun pros. Limiting access for to guns at least to people with proper training and no prior police record would at least help avoid those gun killings.\n\nSo what I\'m trying to say is this:\n\nThere are valid arguments for promoting gun control. There are also valid reasons why nitpicking on mass shootings is effective towards this goal.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to require those who have prescriptions for anxiety meds, depression meds, add meds, etc to require psychiatric evaluations before they are allowed to proceed.\n\n2) Gun control would actually cut down all of the gun violence scenarios you outlined in the long run. Illegal firearms start their lives as legal firearms. By waning the number of legal firearms going into circulation, eventually you will also see a reduction in illegally owned gun violence.\n\n3) If i remember correctly, a majority of gun violence in general is suicide by handgun.

Math.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing: The difference between the US and other similar nations in terms of gun deaths is almost beyond belief.\n\nThe population of the US is about the same as the populations of the UK, Germany, Poland, Japan, and Australia combined.\n\nThose five countries, in the most recent year for which data is available, had a combined total of 126+848+76+23+238 = 1,311 gun deaths of all kinds (homicide, suicide, and accidental shooting).\n\n[Firearms and armed violence, country by country](https://www.gunpolicy.org/)\n\nBy comparison, the gun death total in the US was 39,773. That‚Äôs almost exactly 30 times as many.\n\nThe US has thirty times as many gun deaths as it should, based on the numbers from those other nations.\n\nSide note: I didn‚Äôt cherry-pick those countries. Nearly every modern nation has minuscule gun death numbers (Norway - 77, Italy - 701, Greece - 146, etc.)\n\nAs of Aug. 8, 2019, there were 246 deaths from mass shootings in the US.\n\nNow, 246 deaths is entirely too many. It‚Äôs more than the entirety of gun deaths in four of the countries I mentioned previously, and that data is for an entire year, rather than just over 7 full months. But, as far as the US is concerned, it‚Äôs a relatively small number (around 1% of gun deaths annually in the US are from mass shootings).\n\nSo, what‚Äôs different? Only one thing is consistently different - the availability of guns. In the vast majority of modern nations, guns are rare, hard to get, require licensing and training, and cannot be carried publically under most circumstances.\n\nIn the US, guns outnumber people, and nearly anyone can get their hands on some serious firepower with little impediment."", 'point 4 is the crux of your argument. because it implies that stopping mass shooting is totally unimportant as long as there are worse things happening.

It would mean less guns overall, and many of the guns that live in cities where they‚Äôre illegal were purchased in cities where they are legal.\n\nGranted, stricter gun regulations would not completely resolve the high murder rate in our country, as you point out, most murders are being conducted with illegally owned guns. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that stricter gun laws wouldn‚Äôt help. \n\nOf course there is additional action that needs to take place. My general suggestion on this is cultivating an overall better environment for people: better policing (training for cops which includes skills in establishing a good relationship with the community), a more rehabilitative prison system than punitive one, more education, financial security among the people. Just a few high level suggestions. \n\nThose are long term solutions, both in implementation and result. In the immediate, we need to do something in the here and now to help end this epidemic our nation is facing.\n\nI‚Äôve come up with an analogy I found to be pretty fair against the argument that the guns themselves aren‚Äôt the issue: your child keeps painting all over the house. You know they‚Äôre acting out for deeper reasons, maybe they need more attention, challenge, a feeling of importance. You know the paint itself isn‚Äôt the real issue, but in the moment, as the paint is ruining your precious furniture, there‚Äôs only one thing you can do: take the paint away. You take it away, you work on the deeper issues, and then you give the paint back when they are ready to handle it.\n\nWith stricter gun regulations, well those who are deemed, through a much more vigorous series of analyses, unfit to carry guns shouldn‚Äôt have them. I don‚Äôt at all see how this is a big ask, not sure if you do, yourself. Maybe we can become a nation again with less strict rules, bring back the semi‚Äôs. But right now its a huge slap in the face to victims and their loved ones to pledge for them on the streets.\n\nTo address each point:\n\n1. Mass shootings getting too much attention in the media... I don‚Äôt see it as some anti-gun conspiracy. Viewers get hooked on stories like that. The shooters feel some desired notoriety, it‚Äôs an issue I think but not in the way you seem to think. I have no suggestions there, but don‚Äôt see how it helps your point anyway. Mass shootings are horrific headlines, smaller more personal murders will simply never get the same attention. \n\n2. Pretty much same point as 1, while they‚Äôre atypical, you‚Äôve already spoken to how horrific they are I believe (or eery). Of course they‚Äôre going to get a lot of attention.\n\n3. Right, more personal/gang gun violence/murders happen in these deprived neighborhoods. I always want to ask the people who point to this fact, many who make it seem as though the violence exists there because guns are illegal and civilians can‚Äôt protect themselves (you didn‚Äôt quite lay that out as a point, but just saying for all), if they genuinely think guns should be legal in these areas. If they would step foot in Chicago the day they sold AR-15s (edited from AK to AR) at Walmart. I‚Äôm sorry but thank God guns are illegal there! It would only make things much worse. Again though, stricter gun control will only help the situation some, not completely resolve it, but with the violence our nation is seeing today, it‚Äôs a huge step.\n\n4. It wouldn‚Äôt help by a lot...I disagree. Do you have any points to back that idea with? I think if we had stricter gun laws we could get closer to 0 mass murders, and far less other homicides as well as it would limit the ways in which people are able to get access to both legal and illegal guns.\n\n5. Essentially your point is that too many people will not stand for it. It will upset too many people, it‚Äôs too divisive. That‚Äôs not a valid argument. We need to seek truth and justice, not appease the nation in spite of what is actually right. The gun owners would get over it. \n\n6. Yes, this is another great suggestion, but in conjunction with stricter gun control as I‚Äôve spelled it out in my thoughts above.\n\nHope we can have a dialogue and thanks for posting!', '[removed]', ""Most mass shootings don't get any attention from the gun control movement, because they only involve black people."", ""It's important to recognise that this is a very, very messy issue. It's not going to be fixed with a single measure.\n\nThe question is: do gun controls reduce death? It then comes down to: Is the price worth paying?\n\nIf you knew that a certain type of gun control, or a combination of measures, would reduce deaths by firearms by 50%, would you do that, or would it be unacceptable because it's not 100%? That's a hypothetical of course, but it's worth considering. \n\nLook at seat belts. They do not save every life. Indeed there are around 100 crash fatalities a day in the US. But that is not an argument to abandon seat belts - it's an argument for additional measures.\n\nWould bringing in measures that save lives be worth it even if it's only a few lives? We know they have worked in other countries to reduce mass shootings. Australia is often brought up as an example, but other countries like the UK have seen mass shootings reduce after restricting access.\n\n>Focusing so much on mass shootings makes it seem that if only we could stop (the wrong) people from getting hold of AR-15s we would reduce gun violence by a lot. It wouldn't.\n\nYet it makes sense to target mass shootings. They are commited by a few people and kill a large number of people. It's easier to spot patterns and to reduce the number of these than it is to tackle gang violence.\n\nBear in mind the situation in the US is not normal, and again, other countries have taken measures that demonstrably work.\n\nYet even in countries where weapons are illegal gangs will get hold of them. Penalties for being caught with one are high, so they are of course rarer. Firearm deaths in the uk are under 100 a year. They are (by 2017 numbers) 160 times higher in the US. \n\nSo again... it makes sense to target the crimes that gun control has been shown to be effective against.\n\n>Focusing so hard on which guns people who follow the laws should be allowed to buy really pisses off the community of gun owners \n\nThe 2nd amendment is the right to bear arms. That that right shall not be infringed. The question of course is: Does that mean the right to own as many weapons as you like unrestricted? Or does it simply mean arms in general. Because there are already restrictions in many states on who can own certain weapons. \n\nThe thing is, if the only weapons available were hunting rifles then it would be much harder to cause mass carnage. If there were significant restrictions to owning such weapons you would likely keep it out of the hands of at least one person willing to use it for murder.\n\nI'm not arguing for only hunting rifles to be available. But if access to weapons able to cause mass killings was restricted, monitored, with mentally ill and criminals restricted from having them, and a database of every weapon, then this would restrict access. It would reduce the chances. Not ALL mass killings. But perhaps some. \n\nIs inconvenience to responsible owners a price worth paying to save lives? It should be.\n\n>The pathology of mass shootings is atypical. They are mostly carried out by lone individuals who have spent some time stockpiling weapons \n\nOften the issue of mental health is brought up. If the mentally ill were not allowed to own weapons (or there were strict regulations on owning them) then it's likely you would keep them out of the hands of someone who is ill enough to murder indiscriminately. If ownership was restricted it would mean there would be less mentally unsound people with access to them.\n\n>Effective gun control isn't just about laws (most guns that kill people are already illegal) but policies that implement them. e.g. national database of gun buyers to prevent straw buyers funnelling guns into cities\n\nDatabases and waiting times and all those are measures are part of gun control and absolutely what people are calling for. Yet the NRA and various other groups (GOP included) work to ensure that absolutely none of these measures happen.\n\nPerhaps it works. Perhaps mass shootings reduce in numbers. At that point it can be explored what further action could be taken to reduce firearm murders further. \n\nBut there should be some kind of first step.

Here in New Zealand, after the March terrorist attack, the immediate (and somewhat natural for New Zealanders) response was what did we do wrong? What could we do better? Our prime minister made several appearances with the victims, made sure the entire country stood still and in silence (Even fast food places stopped everything they were doing) exactly a week after the shooting and played the call to prayer on loud speakers and radios. Police were stationed outside of every mosque in the country for a week and a half. Flowers were placed by the public at every mosque. An event was run at my university, where they opened the doors to every student and staff to come and talk about what happened and what we could do better. We cried on each other‚Äôs shoulders. Even today we still talk about what we could do better. Most strikingly, our gun control laws were tightened immediately, and I have seen very little outcry about it. There‚Äôs been a collective understanding that guns mean less than human lives, and as a country we are more than okay with that. It baffles me that America sees this differently. That those hundreds of lives that could be saved are not worth saving because people want to have guns. From an outsider perspective, I can‚Äôt understand the argument that just because lives can be saved doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs worth doing.', 'While I think gun control is a necessity, we need to get to the root cause of the problem, but for me it‚Äôs just a bandage, and a much needed one. \n\nThe typical profile of mass shooters is typically young whiter male; who feels disengaged by society and threatened by other groups of minority. Technology and the media can play a role in this, but there is something going on in the mind of these young men; that we should seek to understand.', "">Mass shootings get a lot of attention in the news media because they are exciting. But they don't actually kill that many people\n\nMass shootings get so much of the attention from the gun control movement because the lawmakers are human. As humans it is difficult for us to focus on small incidences that add up over time (That's one reason why Climate change doesn't seem like a threat because it happens slowly). So if you want someone (ie Lawmakers) to listen to you, you need to draw their attention to 'exciting' events like Mass Shootings rather than boring statistics about isolated incidences. \n\nIt's human nature that small things adding up over time doesn't seem much of a threat or a problem to us (when it really is more dangerous) compared to intense cluster of the same things happening in a short period of time. \n\n>mostly carried out with illegally owned handguns, not legally owned AR-15s.\n\nIn a sea of legally owned weapons it would be much more difficult to police a few illegally owned hand guns. In a place where legally owned handguns are commonplace, an illegal one is difficult to spot because it doesn't look out of place. Compared to a country with very strict gun laws and as a result much less gun ownership, if you see a gun, it's more than likely that it is an illegal weapon. \n\nEDIT: Grammar \n\n>Focusing so much on mass shootings makes it seem that if only we could stop (the wrong) people from getting hold of AR-15s we would reduce gun violence by a lot. It wouldn't\n\nMaking it difficult to get any gun will deter people from going out and buying one. They will only buy one because they feel they really need it and feel that it's worth it to go through the long and stringent procedure to procure one. \n\nUS has more guns than people. If you manage to limit gun ownership, it'll be easier to weed out illegal trade of guns because now you no longer have an ocean of legal guns to search"", 'I\'m late to the party but here is the question I would ask: At what point do you say ""no"" to a weapon being legal? If in 20 years Smith & Wesson invents a plasma gun that can eviscerate an entire 40-story skyscraper and everyone inside of it in the blink of an eye, would people after one such event still say ""oh, well, that incident that just killed 3,000 people is a poor justification for gun control"" ? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf mass shootings are a ""poor justification"" for gun control, what IS a good justification for it? There are none - because mass shootings are reason enough. The fact that one lunatic can violently end the lives of 50+ people, shattering the hearts of thousands of others, in the matter of minutes completely outweighs any reason one could give for needing to own an AK-47... ""Self defense..."" Bullshit. ""In case of a tyrannical government..."" Bullshit. ""For sport..."" Bullshit.', 'just because ""not that many people die"" doesn\'t make it less bad hundreds of people are still dying because of retarded gun laws', ""Just compare the US to the world and you will see you are wrong. How often do you hear of mass shooting in western Europe? Every few years. How often do you hear of mass or school shootings in the US? several times a year.\nGuess whats heavily controlled in Europe?\n\nAmerican gun laws are just an irrational interpretation of the constitutional guaranteed freedom. Real freedom isn't owning a gun, real freedom is freedom of knowledge and information."", ""Maybe it's not mass shootings that should be catalyst for the change but because there are, as you put it, 14k murders with guns a year. It is completely out of control. Making tougher regulations for gun ownership doesn't affect anyone who should have one for practical reasons."", ""I think the biggest issue here is the lack of empathy and putting ourselves in such a position our own egos can outweigh the pros. \n\nYou're using legitimate numbers, but I think the reason we all have a lack of care about this issue is our own personal sentiment to this issue. Everyone calling for no need for more gun control understands they don't require it themselves. It's looked at from a personal standpoint, not an external standpoint. Some gun owners understand they probably won't ever need an AR-15 for any reason other than enjoyment, which is perfectly acceptable. I've shot an AR-15 before, and was so nervous to have that kind of power in my hands. I think the thing we forget most is that you said 117 people that were killed in mass shootings is under 1%, but that under 1% were still human beings that did not deserve to fucking die by any means. We owe it to our fellow human beings to get that 1% down to 0% in anyway possible. If your justification for justifying owning a gun is that not enough people are dying from it, and not that people ARE dying from it. I think you need reevaluate your outlook on what life being taken away by acts of random means. That number by any means above 0 is detrimental to society. No one deserves to have someone else take their life away from them, and justifying owning a gun because not enough people are effected is wrong in my opinion. \n\nAlso, if you are able to legally own a gun and are mentally safe enough to do so then stricter gun laws likely won't even effect you. If they do, maybe mentally you aren't as sane as you think which wouldn't be surprising in today's age."", ""Uniquely American problem. Only the US allows guns. Only the US has gun problems. I'm sorry but the US does know how much the rest of the world looks down to them when it comes to guns. It just seems so simple and I find it very hard to understand how so many people, and it's not idiots, it's rational-thinking people, who still believe that they need a gun to defend themselves. I just don't get that. Can somebody please explain to me how it is sensible to allow guns?\n\nAnd to answer why I can't agree with your point that mass shootings on their own don't justify gun control, they do. If, say, the rest of the world doesn't allow guns and one country does, that country then has frequent mass shootings, the rest of the world doesn't, well that's enough justification to me."", ""You're absolutely right that mass gun murders are only a very small percentage of overall gun violence. But ultimately, that argument is whataboutism.\n\nIf we could stop 117 murders per year by tightening gun regulations- particularly ones that, in your own words, are particularly upsetting- and have the terroristic effect of making innocent civilians fear for their lives near-constantly (e.g. people checking the exits in cinemas, mass shooter drills in schools, etc.) then what does it matter that they're only 0.8% of the total? Near 1% is absolutely worth enacting legislation for. That's 117 people dead, 117 families ripped apart. We shouldn't treat it as a mere statistic. 117 people potentially saved is *huge*.\n\nYou're also correct that more needs to be done in terms of education, social services, policing, wealth distribution, etc. to address the problems that create gun violence in impoverished communities. But we can do that, and *also* take the simple, common sense gun control measures that would make it more difficult for any random individual to kill several to dozens of people without warning or pattern."", ""Let's not forget that mass shooters believe they will have a large impact on society and want to cause discomfort and discourse.  Gun control debates encourage them more."", '[removed]', 'At 284 police per 100,000 population the USA ranks 90th for amount of law enforcement to population.', "">who have spent some time stockpiling weapons \n\nI disagree with this. I know the media likes to build everything up into 'an arsenal', but someone having 1000 rounds and 3 rifles is not an arsenal. If anything it's on the low end, for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, non-gun people don't understand that accuracy is more than just holding it straight. Firearms are stressed to the absolute limits and there are a lot of dynamic factors going on. Metal stretches, barrels ring back and forth like a bell, a cartridge that has x pressure in one rifle has a completely different pressure and performance in an otherwise identical rifle that has a worn chamber. One particular powder manufactured under strict quality control will have subtle but significant differences in burn rates from lot to lot (production batches), enough that a particular load that is safe for one lot needs to be redone when you buy the same exact powder again. You basically have to start over and work up from scratch.\n\nIt takes time, effort, and hundreds of rounds of minor adjustments and documentation to work up a round, and even then you may not arrive at the exact same performance you had the last round. Not to mention expensive. A cheap hand load is around $.30-.40, which means it costs you $30-40 just to find out what you're looking at. Some rifle loads are closer to $3-4 each. \n\nBecause of this, people who need that performance routinely buy ammo, powder, bullets, etc in extremely large lots. You can buy .223 in 60k round 55 gallon drums. You don't want to go through $40 worth of ammo and waste 100 rounds in testing just to make a batch of 200. You want a batch of 1000 or 5000."", '  \n\nOpening myself up to a lot of criticism here, but something needs to be said about 2nd Amendment rights. I fear the Democrats may lose the 2020 general election, if they don‚Äôt start talking common sense about guns. Taking away AR-15 rifles will have zero impact on mass shootings or gun violence in general.\n\nFor starters, hand guns are responsible for far more gun violence in this country than any other type of firearm. Hand guns are also easier to conceal, and empty magazines can be replaced by pre-loaded ones in less than a second. A skilled shooter can handle two of them at once. After the Government comes after your AR-15‚Äôs, they will quickly discover that hand guns are just as effective at domestic terrorism. Other effective methods of harming a large number of people in a short amount of time include: Uhaul trucks against pedestrians, small aircraft, bombs made from pool chemicals and fertilizer, pipe bombs, intentional natural gas leaks, armed drones, and many more.\n\nBefore politicians start threatening to violate the Constitution, they might want to consider addressing the root of the problem. A firearm is a tool. If a surgeon botches a surgery with a scalpel, should we ban all scalpels? If a terrorist uses a Uhaul van to mow down 50 pedestrians, should we ban all rental cars? People who believe that guns are the source of the problem, clearly have a disconnect from reality.', ""Since its impossible to prevent murder by passing laws, I see all gun control measures as nonsensical. The only fair thing to do is to allow people to own any weapon they can afford to purchase, without restrictions of any kind, which gives the average person a fighting chance to survive violent encounters. Of course, self protection aside, it's important for a populace to be at least as well armed as their government in case the need arises to fight against tyranny.""]"

CMV: Gun control is good,"As of now, I believe that the general populace shouldn‚Äôt have anything beyond a pistol, but that even a pistol should require serious safety checks.

Be it technique or quality of the gun, or physique or talent of the individual, anyone can be effective with a gun. In terms of delivering violence, the gun is the single most equal weapon. \n\nNow. On the topic of self defense. If someone wants to exercise their right to irrevocably violate my rights and my person, I will enact upon all means necessary to defend myself. I will presume that you are not against the concept of self defense. So, what should I do? \n\nPlay the card of surrender and hope that he whoever is attacking me will spare some mercy - quite literally putting my hands at the life of someone else‚Äôs whims and wherewithals? Or do I wait for the rescue efforts of someone else (e.g. cops) - once again putting myself at the whims, diligence, and promptness and skill of someone else to preserve my own safety. Or do I take it upon myself to secure my own safety? \n\nI think it is undeniable (and frankly will require a lot of evidence of the contrary to change my mind otherwise) that my interests are best upheld by well, myself. So then, the optimal solution to secure my interests would be to protect myself, since neither the aggressor nor the intervening saviors will hold me as their number one priority. And what is the best tool to assist me in that endeavor of keeping myself safe? What could it be if not the gun?\n\nThis rationale applies in all cases upon which you can argue for or against gun rights. Whether it be an illegal intruder in your home, or a feral, aggressive animal, or a crazy mass shooter, or the tyrannical actions of an authoritarian and oppressive government, the only thing keeping yourself alive is a sufficiently powerful deterrent.\n\nIn almost every case a mass shooting is going to be spontaneous, at least from the perspective of those who are to be involved in it. While some outliers may happen, the norm has not seen the shooter(s) dispatch a letter or announcement to their victims, to any would-be saviors, or other parties that he will seek to kill them at x specified location, at y specified time, and for z purpose. Or, in the case that these signals are raised, they are obscured or raised in an environment invisible to the would-be victims. So then, if you are caught in the sudden storm of chaos that is ground zero of a mass shooting event, would you prefer yourself completely defenseless and at the total mercy and whims of an individual who most certainly is not operating on the same basis if logic as yourself - of which deescalating conversation at the heat of the moment is nigh impossible? Are you preferable to the idea of leaving yourself totally helpless to the time it takes for law enforcement to make their way to your location, engage in a lengthly conversation with your aggressor, during all of which you are completely vulnerable? Remember that gun control laws are only abided by the lawful people - the demographic least likely to commit such heinous crimes. These laws mean moot to the criminal, and with how easy it is in this modern day and age to assemble an impromptu firearm of deadly capabilities, a gun control ban is an act of stripping lawful people of their ability to protect themselves. \n\n\nNote that I am not advocating for total gun freedom or an anarchy of guns. I am wholly supportive of regulative policies and background checks to minimize the access points of the mentally unstable and criminal in obtaining their weapons. But this would be limited to the initial acquisition process and only regarding the individual seeking to purchase it - not the gun itself, nor the type of gun, or its caliber, or the ammunition, etc. It‚Äôs almost analogous to modern phones - are you willing to return to the old days of analog telephones and rotary dials simply because of the potentially harmful effects of the modern smartphone and its apps and features?

Like the following examples: student loans crisis, border crisis, the problems with our health care system, income inequality. All of which could be solved with a case of beer and two people from either side that are willing to have an open and honest conversation.', 'The first gun control in the USA was that black people were to be severely beaten for the possession of a firearm unless they were enslaved and had a letter from their owner saying they were allowed to carry said firearm - even free blacks being prohibited from possessing said firearms.\n\n> how could we have a Socialist revolution without some kind of militia\n\nThrow a revolution and be unsuccessful and you get killed. Be successful and you are viewed as a threat against the new regime and are also killed. Look at what happened to everyone from the Trotskyists to the Mensheviks in the Soviet Union. Socialist ideology is fundamentally nonsensical.', ""On the whole I agree with you that gun control is a good idea. If you reduce the number of guns, and reduce the availability of guns, you will reduce the number of people who are killed by guns. That's simply fact. You won't eliminate it, but you will reduce it. We know from experience that the more that you restrict access to something, the less people use it. We see that with things as simple as cigarettes. We've raised the taxes through the roof on them and the rates of use of cigarettes have gone down dramatically. We've restricted the access to fully automatic firearms, and the use of fully automatic firearms in crimes has gone down dramatically. It's pretty simple stuff.\n\nI disagree with you in one important respect. Mass shootings get a lot of attention, but they aren't really the biggest problem with guns. They aren't even second on the list. Both of the biggest problems with guns have to do with handguns. Those guns that you think that people should still have access to. Handguns kill about 30,000 Americans per year. 30,000. Assault rifles, or rifles in general kill about a thousand. And all of those are tragedies, but you can see the difference in the numbers. Handguns kill so many people for two reasons. One they're easy to conceal. This makes it very easy for criminals who want to commit murder, or want to commit armed robbery, to get the gun to where they want to commit the crime. A long gun is much harder to conceal, much more likely to be seen by someone, and much more likely to draw the attention of law enforcement. The second, and even larger problem, is that handguns are used in 20,000 suicides a year. Now, one might object that someone who wants to commit suicide will commit suicide. This is not the case. The big difference between having easy access to a handgun to commit suicide, and not having so, is in that you have time to reconsider. If you have to rig a stove to commit suicide or to rig up your garage to commit suicide or find a bridge to jump off of to commit suicide, all of those take a lot longer to do. This gives you a chance to think harder about whether you really want to. It also gives more time and opportunity for other people to intervene in the attempt. This is why we see, generally speaking, lower suicide rates in countries that have more difficulty accessing handguns specifically. There are some that are higher, but those are typically related to culturally specific issues, such as japan.\n\nMy personal stance is that the ideal gun control laws for the United States would be to retain the ability to own rifles and shotguns with very limited ammunition capacity. Something like three rounds with a non detachable magazine. This would allow sufficient defense against large animals in the wild, as well as legitimate hunting needs. But it would make much more difficult the kinds of mass shootings that we have become all too accustomed to. Or, frankly a whole lot of use of firearms in crimes.\n\nRemember, this is absolutely positively not about preventing things from ever happening. It's about reduction. And reducing from 30,000 firearm deaths to something with even one less digit, is something absolutely worth working to achieve.

The prevailing assumption of the second amendment as it pertains to a ""tyrannical government"" is that said tyranny will rise to power, it will begin suspending rights & imposing authoritarian restrictions, then a violent insurrection will occur to which will destroy the existing government and a new government will be established. Part of this colored by our history, both of the major insurrections in US history (the revolutionary war & the civil war) were attempts to break away and form new governments, however it isn\'t always the case that an armed insurrection necessarily is attempting to establish a new government, rather the objective is to make the enforcement of certain laws impractical due to the risks associated with the attempted enforcement. \n\nThe Civil Rights Movement in the United States, as alluded to in the opening quote. While the Civil Rights Movement is remembered as a non-violent protest, if it weren\'t for well armed black militia (compromised predominantly of WWII veterans) like the Deacons of Defense & Justice it would have been a far more violent & deadly affair. There were a number of overt attacks by law enforcement and/or the Klan on black communities in the American South during the Civil Rights era, an example of which is the Columbia TN Race Riots of 1946, however due to the heavily armed nature of Southern blacks meant that these attacks meant they would be quickly repelled with minimal casualties on either side, and forced the Klan & sympathetic law enforcement to operate in the shadows and carry out clandestine attacks like bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings out fear of their own safety. \n\nTo provide a counterexample, like the US at the time, France was experiencing its own form of a civil rights movement. Algeria in the late 1950s was still a colony of France, and Algerians living both France & Algeria were treated as second class citizens and lacked full rights granted by the French constitution. This prompted a number of protests looking for full legal rights for Algerians living in France and independence for Algeria itself, to which the French, which was and still is a modern, Western democracy, responded with an act of genocide against the Algerian people. It is estimated that over 30,000 Algerians were killed in Algeria in 1945, with thousands more being killed by French authorities up until independence occurred in 1962, and several hundred more were killed in France, the largest of which was the Paris Massacre of 1961 where over 300 Algerians protestors were killed indiscriminately by the Parisian police. \n\nIt\'s the stark contrast in the relatively bloodless nature of the Civil Rights Movement in the American South compared to the absolute massacre that was the Algerian independence movement in France is the fundamental reason why I support the right to bear arms.', ""Let me put in a way that is easily understandable.

There's 300+ million Americans, 70 million+ rifles, and we average between 0 and 1 rifle deaths per day in this country.   \n\n\nAnd the fact that you can defend your home with one makes society safer.

Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. **To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence.** It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. **Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation**, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. **Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.** And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.', 'Why a pistol?

Logical arguments when used effectively generally argue within the confines of already existing principles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe general argument in the US in favour of gun rights from a principled perspective comes from the idea of fundamental/natural rights. That all humans are by their creator (whoever you decide them to be) with fundamental/natural rights that cannot be removed by a government while remaining just. One of these rights is the right to bear arms because any government however just has the potential to become tyrannical and as such the people should be able to overthrow it if necessary and while examples of successful mostly unarmed revolutions against authoritarian states exist from Poland to Tunisia to Kyrgyzstan it makes it a whole lot easier if the people are sufficiently armed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are though I think at least a few arguments in favour of gun rights or at least against gun control from a practical perspective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first is that guns are not particularly complicated or hard to make. The UVF was a lovely little organization which my family has personally suffered from that was active during the Northern Irish troubles, a roughly 30 year long conflict in Northern Ireland. They were under pretty much complete sanction from the outside world with no real access to firearms or ammunition and yet with at most only a few hundred men working on the problem and access to basic machine tooling they were able to produce their own crude copies of Stirling submachine guns, their big problem was a lack of ability to produce their own magazines as magazine technology is actually fairly complicated but this has largely been solved today with homemade magazines being far more viable. And this repeats itself, while Mexican cartels have the American market from which to acquire their firearms it is much more limited in South America and so criminal groups there produce their own firearms, as do criminal and militant groups in places like Pakistan (the Pakistani ones are in many ways the most technologically limited in terms of how little access to precision and machine tooling they have and yet the most impressive with what they are able to produce going far beyond the open bolt SMGs of many other groups). What this means in the American context is that genuine attempts at gun control that aren\'t banning specific, mostly irrelevant cosmetic features of weapons like the 90s assault weapons ban or California\'s current rifle and pistol bans or requiring an attainable but annoying license to own a weapon is that real serious gun control is likely a non starter. There are millions of people in this country with both access to machine tools and a political interest in ruining any attempt at gun control and if you like them or agree with them or not they exist and if a few hundred people in Northern Ireland with massively outdated equipment by today\'s standards could defy the attempts of the British state to control the access of guns in that country there\'s just no way you can do the same in the US. Already there are things like the ""FGC-9"" a 3d printed firearm designed specifically to get around EU regulations but which has taken off with a certain type of gun enthusiast in the US as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a second as well which is that overall globally there is a negative correlation between murder rate and gun ownership, actually quite significantly so. Of course this is mostly because the areas with high gun ownership are Europe with a rather low murder rate and North America (or at least the US and Canada) with a roughly average murder rate and the middle east which may have a bunch of other issues going on but has a surprisingly low murder rate. Now these things are mostly unrelated and connected to cultural factors in all the places in particular but that\'s kind of the point, the most clear factors at play are disconnected from firearms legislation.', ""I love shooting sports. They're my number one hobby. I barely shot before diving into sports and was similarly against anyone owning a gun. I didn't even agree with your stance that people should have pistols because pistols are for killing people. Now, I think the best solution to gun violence would be requiring people to be a member of a licensed gun club, and requiring safe storage to purchase guns. Shooting at organized events really drills into you the importance of the danger of guns and how to handle them properly. Nobody is more cautious with their guns than someone who has researched their gear, spent a bunch of money on it, and is trying to get high performance out of it. And if you attend range days the Range Officers are relentless in enforcing safety rules. I also think that requiring proof of locking storage that can hold all of the firearms you own would lead to a lot less unlisted weapons floating around, as well as fewer toddlers shooting people."", 'TL:DR Guns aren\'t the problem.

While the 2A is a constitutionally protected right.\n\n [3,058 teens died to car accidents in 2021](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/teenagers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2,590 teens died to firearm related deaths. 32% being unaliving.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/06/gun-deaths-among-us-kids-rose-50-percent-in-two-years/) 2021\n\nThat number includes the 32% that have unalived themselves with firearms. We don\'t have a gun control problem. We have a people problem. Some need to be locked up, and others need serious mental and emotional help.', 'People who use guns for evil are already breaking the law. Having another law to make guns (or certain types) illegal will just be another law for evil people to break at the expense of civilized society and the law abiding.', 'So I‚Äôm pro-gun, these are a few of my points:\n\n1. Gun control only controls the guns of law abiding citizens. No criminal is gonna look at a gun law and go aw shoot, it‚Äôs illegal oh well. All gun control does is keep good people from protecting themselves.\n\n2. For people who live in rural areas guns are a necessity for hunting and protection from wild animals\n\n3. Guns aren‚Äôt the issue, people are. Guns don‚Äôt kill people, people do. It is far more productive to tackle WHY people kill people then to take away their weapons, cause they‚Äôll just find new ones anyway. \n\n4. Guns are also just fun if you know what you‚Äôre doing and being safe. I love going to the gun range or going out into the country to practice. It‚Äôs legitimately just a good time and has been a bonding thing for me and my grandfather.\n\n5. Good guys with guns, stop bad guys. Good guys with nothing? They die. I‚Äôd rather everyone carry and know how to use a gun instead of only criminals having them. Imagine a shooter walks into a cafe, pulls out his gun only to come face to face with every single person in there pulling out their gun. He might get one person before he‚Äôs taken out. \n\nAt the end of the day, when you know what you‚Äôre doing: guns are fun, they save lives, and they are the best way to protect yourself. As a young woman living all alone in a downtown area‚Ä¶I can not wait til I‚Äôm able to buy a gun.', '>my counter to that is that it‚Äôs far more dangerous for society as a whole for everyone to be walking around with guns that it is for a few criminal minds to have them.\n\nWhat makes you believe this? The problem that you are concerned about (mass shootings) didn\'t occur until far after the mass adoption of the AR platform. The problem isn\'t the weapons. The problem is overwhelmingly culture and there is some reason to believe medical. So many of these people that commit heinous acts are on medications that people just don\'t understand. \n\n>Also, it just doesn‚Äôt seem fair to normalize knowing how to use a highly complex piece of military equipment,\n\nThese weapons aren\'t complicated. They aren\'t military equipment. What isn\'t ""fair"" about it? Why do you think you get to define ""fair""?', 'America is a very large and open country, with several different ways of life all under one umbrella. Laws that make sense for you, where you live, may not make sense other places. Boston, MA for example, they have different gun laws than Indianapolis. In Boston it‚Äôs very tight, high stress, high population density. Indianapolis not as much. IN had an attempt at a mass shooting at a mall, someone who was disobeying the signs at said mall, saved COUNTLESS lives. Similar stories happen, and usually don‚Äôt get the coverage that the mas casualties get. \n\nAnother view point.  A ‚Äúmass shooting‚Äù has varying definitions, and last I researched, it involved as few as 4 people. Which seems a bit ridiculous to compare the Las Vegas shooting to a spat of gang land violence. The numbers are made to look bad.\n\nLastly, and an important bit to keep in mind. America is not like anywhere else in the world, as far as I know. You have a right to protect yourself with a firearm here. You also have a responsibility to be knowledgeable about what you own, and how to use it properly. \n\nOne more thing, the 2nd amendment assures the right to bear arms. We are the militia. We will protect our constitution.', 'The problem isn\'t ""guns kill people,"" it\'s ""people kill people."" People aren\'t just killing people for no reason, there\'s clearly an issue in mental health here. The solution isn\'t to ban guns, it\'s to prioritize the mental health of our citizens however that may be so that they don\'t do this kind of stuff again. Also, the gun industry in the United States is MASSIVE, and currently the Gun Industry contributes $80.73 billion in economic activity to the U.S economy. There\'s a reason why there\'s more guns than people. If we were to get rid of our gun production, it would be a massive blow to our economy.', ""It doesn't sound like you know much about guns...\nPistols are FAR more dangerous that rifles, guns are not complex pieces of machinery (your car is many times more complex, difficult to use, and more likely to accidentally kill or injure yourself or others). It's also interesting to me that a society where everyone is armed sounds dystopian to you. Dystopia is pretty much the complete opposite of that.\n\nI'm pro gun, and it used to be for the whole revolution and protection from the government thing, but it's obvious to me at this point that things will never be bad enough that the American people will rise against their government. I don't think it can get bad enough to motivate us to do that. That being said, I think the ability to own guns is important for self defense, defense of others and because (whether we'd ever use them for this reason or not) it DOES serve to keep the government somewhat in check. Guns are a great equalizer."", 'We\'ve got enough stats showing that the cities tightest on gun control are also the most crime-ridden. It looks like the bad guys are keeping their guns, while the good guys aren\'t. And with all this talk from progressives about ""defund the police,"" what is the guarantee that you will keep them safe?\n\n  \nYou can\'t have it both ways. If you are going to take guns away from people, you have to at least make sure that when people call 911, the police shows up in one minute or less, and that the police is color blind.', 'You\'re so surface level, \n\n\nFirst of all, the only true answer that\'s going to set everything right is if we tear the large countries into smaller ones. \n\nThink of society as a pyramid where the top has the most power (government and corporate giants are at the top) \n\nNow imagine we change society so that one entity can never be too powerful, and everyone keeps eachother in check. \n\n\nEven if war breaks out between neighbors, it\'ll be on a much smaller scale. \n\nBack not even so many centuries ago, if people had a problem with corruption, they just overthrow the entire royal family of their culture.  \n\n\nBut when it became a matter of having an army, that began to change drastically. \n\nNow the people and rebellious groups just feel too small to have any power. \n\n\nIt would only be achieved through bloodshed, but the power-hungry countries must be torn into smaller countries. \n\n\nIf society isn\'t one big pyramid, but a bunch of small pyramids, the power will be more distributed to the people. We will be closer to equality. \n\n\nEither we go back to states or cities/towns being their own kingdom, or, we unite a global government so that there can be no thirst for power, \n\nAfter all, the people running the game don\'t need any of its currency. Same goes for a world government, they wouldnt have any other countries to compete with, just focusing on the efficiency and well being of the population. \n\n\n\n\nNow onto gun control. \n\n\nThis doesn\'t make any sense to me. You can make a gun. \n\nWhat is gun control to you? It\'s different depending on who you ask. \n\nWhen a politician says ""I\'m gonna do a gun control"" do you know what he\'s gonna do? Or do you just cheer? \n\n\nIt\'s easy to pass bs corrupt legislations when people like all of you don\'t even read the things they sign. \n\n\nMy ideal form of gun control: guns should be used for sport. \n\n\nI love being competitive, competitive shooting is an insanely fun sport, I don\'t do it much myself but I play other sports. \n\nI will not abide by banning the sport, making it difficult for people to practice. \n\nThey need to be legal as far as tools go. A right proper reason to have one. \n\n\n\nDefense isn\'t a proper reason. I can think of an arsenal more appropriate for self defense than a gun. A gun is overkill. \n\n\nI remember a kid who\'d bring a gun to the skatepark. He said if anyone tries anything he\'ll ""take care of it"" \n\nI convinced him otherwise. I said if anything goes down, a gun is going to escalate it past what any of us wanted. We do things we don\'t mean when our emotions get to us. \n\n\nSince then he was afraid of loosing his cool, and decided to stop bringing it.  \n\n\n\nAn active hunter needs a gun. It\'s a sport and a practice that needs to be protected and respected. I live in a world where most people don\'t even know how to cook for themselves anymore. \n\nEvery year people get lost or go missing, dying in the wild because they just can\'t deal with it. \n\n\nHunting is something you can\'t stop, it\'s ok for it to happen to the animals, we need to be able to do things like this for our own good. \n\nIf our entire species becomes pacifist, would it not make it very easy for outsiders to pillage us? \n\nThat\'s what the vikings took advantage of.  And those countries have become some of the most successful in the world. Clearly Odin smiles on them for all the destruction. \n\n\nThat\'s an excessive example I know but hey, they chose to announce ""we don\'t like to fight""  \n\n\nNow, I hope you understand the world a little better, maybe you over or under react about certain things \n\n\nGuns aren\'t anything crazy, they bore me really. I have a high respect for competitive shooting or any skill related thing. \n\nI don\'t see any reason for exotic or impractical guns. That\'s like buying a hammer made to look like an art piece. \n\nI don\'t think regular people should be able to get guns. I need a license to drive. I should need a license to own weapons. I should only be allowed a license if I have a legitimate reason for owning a gun. And it should be regularly checked that people are actually using the guns, and using them for the purposes they claimed. \n\n\nIt\'d probably be expensive to do that so uh, how about we just stop pumping money into wars between other countries, ok? \n\nHonestly fk America though, trying to leave before the next atrocity', 'Ban all gun ownership by civilians is best.', 'The problem is two-fold, and the crux of that problem is the two arguments I am about to present are politicized to such an extent that they are treated as either or arguments instead of treated as ONE BIG PROBLEM.\n\n\nThe problem with gun violence and particularly the kind that results in mass sh00tings is :\n\n1) a trigger happy society\n2) insufficient mental health care\n\nThe problem is that; on the right side of the political spectrum, they love to talk about ""mental health is the problem"" but fail to address the overabundance of guns as a catalyst which allows the mentally unstable to cause maximum damage.\n\nWhereas on the Left side; they are entirely focused on gun control, whilst ignoring or worst ""encouraging"" mental health issues by pushing acceptance over *TREATMENT*\n\nThese two issues working together came to a head in the most recent incident where an army veteran was the alleged perpetrator.\n\n1) trigger happy society. A person who allegedly checked himself into a mental health institution for delusion related to mass sh00ting... should not have access to a gun. PERIOD.\n\nThis is where stricter gun control needs to be applied.\n\n2) If this person was allegedly checked into an institution for delusions related to mass sh00tings... why was this not followed up ? Why didn\'t the mental health team and law enforcement work together to more strictly monitor this person?\n\nThat is a fault of our leftwing. Always wanting to go for leniency and acceptance... putting the public in danger instead of ""offending"" someone\'s feelings.\n\nTLDR; it is not a question of gun control OR better mental health care... it is a question of stricter gun control with better mental health care.\n\nSo that we can stop having these cases of people with known mental health diagnoses, known to the health system, known to the police system but still somehow always are able to get their hands on a gun during a mental crisis.', 'Do you know the history of the United states?States?... here is aome questions for you.\nWhy do you think the second amendment exists?\nDo you think the strict protection is for a reason?\nHow many countries in history had some freedoms and lost them because the people had their gun rights slowly removed and then eventually taken away?', 'There‚Äôs a wise man that once told me these 2 sentences that answer and disprove any argument u throw at it bc u can see it proved with these mass shootings.‚Äù A single man with a gun can control 100 people without guns.

If anything go for big pharma homie they kill 10 million people in the U.S. alone year compared to 250 a year for gun violence.', 'Usually when I see an anti-gun argument it seems to touch on ideals and unachievable theoretical situations. It makes me assume that the anti-gun individual can\'t be serious unless they are disconnected from reality with privilege/wealth. If the world was a perfect fair place guns could exist and be easily excisable because there would be no fear that they would be poorly kept or that crimes would be committed. Why do you think crimes are committed?\n\nOp, you mention ""if we had a good government"", but we don\'t and could never rely on that idea. if a good government existed today what is to keep it from becoming a bad government tomorrow? Who decides what a good government is, if it is a theocracy I would say there is no way that is pure/good... if it appears good but has extreme poverty and riches how is it good. It\'s an impossibility with the human factor, even in some AI ruled world who programmed the AI?\n\nI\'m open to hearing the anti-gun argument but I don\'t see it in your post. I see a pro-gun argument that isn\'t finished because there are ideals still being clung to and a worry that it would be counterculture in your circle to defend the ideas of being neutral or pro-gun. I\'m not sure your view needs changed but just further explored. Yes its horrible when murders happen, yes guns can be used in negative ways... But why do those things happen, is it the tip of a much bigger iceberg that is focusing on a symptom rather than the causes?', ""I hope too change your view with one word: Israel !\n\nImagine that a neighborhood in an American suburban area was witnessing surprise gunshots, explosions, and screaming. Many homeowners would look out their window wondering what all the chaos is, the run inside to get their guns ready to protect their households. If driving down the stress we witnessed people shooting others indiscriminately, many people would arm themselves immediately before even bringing the car to a full stop. And if American streets were on full out attack. For every 10 people running away to safety (as they should if they have no other means) there would be 2 people running towards the danger to confront it. Essentially creating a defacto counter militia against any attackers.\n\nYou also mentioned a socialist revolution with force, such as those that took place in China, Russia, other Asian and African countries. In America, that ain't happening because of guns. Which is why you see progressive revolutionary politicians trying to take away guns to minimize that inherent barrier. But even though This is a side note to the original topic, there is a way to achieve social revolution without violence in a developed democratic society. The scholars of the Frankfurt School outlined how very clearly less than a century ago. And their guidelines have been heeded over the century, and now we are closer than ever. When the work IS expanded over generations the Revolution is carried out slowly and subvertly. When you try to push it all at once, you will encounter massive pushback. I personally would fight back against any Socialist Revolution and would arm myself against the resulting totalitarian government whether they achieved their tyranny subvertly or militarily. Which is exactly why the founding fathers have us the power for the people to always be able defend themselves rather than to rely on a corruptible body to do so which could turn against them."", 'The real reason you need gun control is because every successful civilization realized that letting the unwashed and stupid masses have access to weapons was only going to result in them slaughtering each other.

Fear and Isolation breed aggressivity and extreme social distrust. With that kind of mentality, using a gun is almost a reflex.\n\nAmerica has become this place of violence, of fearing those living near you, of everyone for themselves. Personally, I hope it can reach a place where owning a gun for self defence is no longer legal. Though, with the current state of political polarization, I don‚Äôt see that happening anytime soon.\n\nThere‚Äôs no reason for you to feel bad about wanting better gun regulations.

CMV: Gun control debate should not revolve around mass shootings,"I'm fairly neutral on the issue of gun control in America, I don't buy the argument that firearms are going to stop a dictatorship or whatever and I'm not interested in arguing that ITT. 

At the same time, I think the pro-gun control side are very focused on mass shootings. Despite the fact that mass shootings statistically kill very very few people. 

https://www.statista.com/statistics/811504/mass-shooting-victims-in-the-united-states-by-fatalities-and-injuries/


It's pretty rare that the US, a country of 320 million people, even see 100 people killed in mass shootings per year. In most years the number of mass shooting death is single or double digits. To put things in perspective the probability of dying in mass shooting is lower than literally being struck by lighting in the US.

Even for gun deaths as a whole mass shootings hardly accounts for 0.2% of total. The leading cause of gun death (over 50%) are due to suicides. Almost all homicides are conducted with hand guns, not assault-style weapons or whatever gun control advocate seem to focus on. And they focus on them as result of mass shootings.

If we are gong to talk about gun control, we should at least focus on the type of shootings which statistically kill most people and happen more frequently. Not very rare incidents.

E: Ok so this kinda blew up and I won't have time to respond to everyone. I'm also not really trying to argue for or against gun control, just the centrality of mass shootings to the entire debate.

While gun violence among gangs, suicides, etc. are worse most people also feel a sense of control over those things. I don't interact with gangs, I am not suicidal, etc. But I do go to the grocery store. I do go to parades. My kids go to school. And because these attacks are just random, they inspire a lot more fear. Even though you could be uninvolved with violence or crime, you could still be randomly shot for no reason. So as a message, it makes sense to focus on things that could effect everyone, rather than things which can be dismissed by the average person."", ""A few other commenters have touched on it, but in reality there's a good (or perhaps I should say \\*effective\\*) reason to focus on that.\n\nIf you're anti-gun violence and have the aim of furthering gun control laws, the best way to do that is to gain popular support.  And people have shown that they're more interested in supporting a cause that stirs them emotionally.\n\nFor whatever reason, good or bad (I personally think it's bad but that's not really the point), people have shown that they'll react MUCH more violently to a single school shooting that kills 5 people than they will to the hundred deaths a year in Oakland CA.\n\nYou can argue against the ends justifying the means, but it's a position pretty widely held these days.

Not very rare incidents. ...\n\nThat people commit suicide or shoot each other with handguns really doesn't tell us anything about whether it makes sense to restrict access to rifles to prevent or manage mass school shootings or not.\n\nIt's also not really as simple as how frequently things happen.   There's some calculus about how likely things are and how important they are.\n\nToday, we're managing measles pretty effectively in the US, but the fact that anti-vaxxers get it shows that measles is likely to spread without the ongoing interventions that we have.  So, despite measles being rare in practice, it does make sense to continue vaccinating people.  \n\nEven in places where big earthquakes are relatively frequent, big earthquakes tend not to happen that much.   That said, when they do happen, they can have a big impact, so it can make sense to prepare for them anyway.\n\nNow, it's pretty clear that people are overselling the frequency and threat of mass school shootings like Uvalde.  The question about how important they are is a bit trickier, but we're certainly in an era of media sensationalism where people are trying to make everything as big as possible to chase eyeballs.  Nonetheless, those are both things to consider when evaluating whether something is a credible or sensible response."", 'Well, mass shootings are the focal point often because we have short memories and these are the instances that stand out in tragedy. Is it the minority of gun violence? Sure. But it‚Äôs often the easiest to for people to immediately sympathize with. A shooting at a school doesn‚Äôt just affect the people killed or injured; it traumatized hundreds of other students, which can have a lasting impact. You think it will never happen in your town, and then it does. It happened in mine. Parents deserve to feel safe with their children in school. Children deserve to feel safe in school. And while they won‚Äôt suddenly stop with restrictions, they‚Äôll inevitably become rarer. That‚Äôs just a simple fact.\n\nJust because mass shootings are the focal point doesn‚Äôt mean that the restrictions won‚Äôt extend to the other more common cases. Real change comes with emotional charges, and that‚Äôs what mass shootings give us. You simply won‚Äôt get people out in waves to actively push for a solution if they aren‚Äôt collectively motivated at the same time. That‚Äôs the sad truth, and that‚Äôs why mass shootings are often the focal point. Would George Floyd have made such a big impact if we weren‚Äôt in the middle of a pandemic where people were looking for something else to really focus on? I don‚Äôt think so. So, really, it becomes a combination of tragic occurrences that everyone can be made aware of being combined with convenience of protest. Which shooting is finally going to break the camel‚Äôs back, so to speak?', 'While suicide is the largest cause of gun deaths and extremely tragic, it\'s very easy for pro-gun people to argue that it is a result of external factors despite access to guns making an impulsive suicide easy and effective. Suicide is also still quite prevalent at comparable levels in countries with gun regulations. It\'s difficult to argue for gun regulations exclusively to combat suicide.\n\nSame with person to person violence which is often also linked to an external factors such as poverty, crime, or a personal dispute. These tragedies are also extremely easy to argue against as ""they would still happen with gun laws"". I don\'t agree with that point, but it still stands that these are easy for gun advocates to argue.\n\nThere\'s a perception that both of these are also relatively easy to avoid on a personal level. People can make an active effort to avoid high crime areas or seek mental health support and this will lower the chances of encountering gun violence. Of course this statement is loaded with privilege, but that\'s besides the point for this argument.\n\nMeanwhile, mass shootings are a direct result of loose gun laws and are almost exclusive to our country at the frequency with which they occur. While other countries have similar mental health issue prevalence, they have very few mass casualty events of this kind. \n\nMass shootings are extremely visible, they shut down entire parts of a town and cause mass trauma. Suicide and single or double casualty shootings only affect a few people in the immediate vicinity.\n\nMost of the casualties of mass shootings aren\'t on the victims, it\'s on the emotional state of a society. Every week there are dozens of mass shootings in the US in places we have long perceived as being safe. When those places come under fire, it\'s not unlike the effects of terrorism. Despite 9/11 only killing a small % of the population, the entire country lived in fear of terrorism for the next decade. Mass shootings have a similar effect. \n\nBy enabling mass shootings, I\'m also of the opinion that guns are an infringement on my personal liberties. I don\'t find it\'s fair that I should live in fear everywhere I go (school, cinema, mall, fourth of July parade) just so that certain people can have a hobby or protect their home.', "">If we are gong to talk about gun control, we should at least focus on the type of shootings which statistically kill most people and happen more frequently.

People can say I have good mental health therefore gun suicide does not affect me and will not affect me. They can say I‚Äôm not worried about guns in the hands of criminals committing crimes because I stay away from the bad parts of town. Those are easy. It‚Äôs a lot harder to say I‚Äôll never be at the wrong movie theater, parade, school, concert, summer camp, or grocery store at the wrong time. Mass shootings are nearly impossible to avoid and it‚Äôs difficult to reduce your individual risk unless you live like a hermit. \n\nSo while I hear what you‚Äôre saying I think your frame is wrong. The pro gun control side isn‚Äôt focused on preventing mass shootings and only mass shootings. They‚Äôre framing the issue in a way to get people on their side and then enact reforms which will decrease both mass shootings and other forms of gun death through things like background checks and mental health evaluations which would impact criminals and potentially suicides.', ""I'm not sure where your source gets it's information, but [this](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting) one has reported 37 deaths in the last week alone in the US. If could be a definitional difference, but whatever the case may be, it is enough to raise issue.  \n\n\nTo preface my point here, I firmly believe in gun ownership.   \n\n\nI think that mass shootings are very relevant to the discussion. If you get prescribed a medication, part of your discussion with the doctor includes possible side effects, no matter how rare. A side effect of gun legislation in the US is mass shootings. Yes, there are people who use guns to hunt, there are people who use guns to commit suicide, there are people who use guns to kill a specific person. But there are also people who use guns to commit mass shootings. That makes it as relevant to the discussion as any other factor. Is it an extreme factor? Maybe. But any legislation that has to do with gun ownership should also be considering the extremes.  \n\n\nBack to the doctor analogy. Let's say you get a medication that has a less than 1% chance to cause blood pressure issues. But you and your family have a history with blood pressure issues. That small chance of a blood pressure issue is now much more prevalent to the discussion you have with your doctor because of your medical history. That extreme becomes more central to the discussion. The US has a long history with gun violence and mass shootings."", 'The issue with gun control isn\'t ""how many lives it saves"" as a raw number, but how many lives it saves compared to how many it ends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are people who blame gun control for the fact that someone was not in a position to use guns in self-defense. These incidents happen, but we also don\'t know if the person using the gun in self-defense would be mistaken by a cop for the aggressor. It\'s certainly happened to well-meaning bystanders trying to open fire on a mass shooter. As well, there is a risk that responding to crime with more firearms and not by tackling its root causes would stunt our empathy for one another, giving way to more death.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf gun control only stopped mass shootings and did less about your run-of-the-mill gang shooting or the like, that\'s still a lot of lives saved. The only way such gang shootings are relevant is if gun control would curb them (maybe, maybe not; when one has few targets at a time and a lot of accomplices, it\'s doubtful one needs a large magazine) or arming law-abiding citizens would deter them (even more doubtful claim, at best, especially when you consider how armed the USA is and yet how rife with gang murders it is).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the question then becomes... how relevant are AR-15s to self-defense against the kinds of murders that happen more often? If you are that severely outnumbered that you cannot fend off your assailants with an ordinary pistol, how are you not so afraid for your life that your trembling hands keep accidentally pointing the gun in the wrong direction and killing innocent bystanders in the process?', '[removed]', '[removed]', 'Why should we accept your ""deaths per incident"" metric as the primary determiner of what one of our myriad policy debates should focus on?\n\nCan I just start doing some novel kind of killing but as long as I keep the numbers low enough (20 per year, say) no one *should* try to spend policy making time trying to prevent me from doing it next year?  ""Oh, those are bush league numbers!""\n\nThe other gun deaths you\'re comparing to are  tragic but also have been around a while.  People have been killing people they know over disputes or killing themselves for a long time.  We have (some) societal approaches to try to address those.\n\nMass shootings where some young white man with a semi automatic rifle goes to some place where he knows there will be a lot of unsuspecting targets to shoot *is a relatively new phenomenon*.  \n\nIn light of a (relatively) novel public threat, we absolutely should talk about *that novel threat* and what policies we can adopt to address it.  Even if it ""only"" kills scores of people every year.\n\nShould we also address gun suicide?  Yes.  Should we also address crime related gun violence?  Yes.  Luckily our government isn\'t just one guy with a limited attention span.  We can, and should, work on many things at once.\n\nIn fact!  The gun legislation that Biden signed into law recently had all kinds of things not specifically related to young-white-male-with-semi-automatic-rifle mass shootings.  For example, they closed the boyfriend loophole that allowed unmarried domestic abusers to buy guns, which will address a different, more deadly category of gun violence.  So in addition to the points above, ""flashy"" mass shootings can spur policy-making for ""mundane"" gun violence as well.', '[removed]', 'It\'s pretty simple. Suicide is not a gun control issue. That\'s why it\'s not a focus of gun control discussions.\n\nYou are missing the true impact about mass shootings by only focusing on deaths as well. Injured people are directly impacted, both physically and mentally, with life-long effects. People who were at the event but weren\'t shot may also be mentally affected, with PTSD or other issues (difficulty in being in public places, crowds, or problems with loud noises). Even mass shootings with zero deaths can have severe and lasting impact on dozens or hundreds of people.\n\nAnd finally, it is the random and uncontrolled nature of mass shootings, combined with the human agency, that makes them more concerning to people. This applies more so if you happen to be in a ""targeted"" group due to your religion, culture, sexual orientation, appearance, etc. There is a difference between something completely random, like lightning, or something unintended, like a vehicular collision, compared to a purposeful and planned even like a mass shooting. The shooters actively want the shooting to happen and are actively working towards it, unlike those other situations.', ""It's the only time that the side that favors control, has any leverage or anything to back up why action is urgent. \n\nThe other side is pretty comfortable"", '>If we are gong to talk about gun control, we should at least focus on the type of shootings which statistically kill most people and happen more frequently. Not very rare incidents\n\nBy the same token, the government should not focus on preventing violent crime and terrorism until they kill more people than heart disease.\n\nKilling 20 kids in school is a massively traumatic event that does not affect only the relatives of the victims. It affects every parent who sends their kids to school, every school teacher, every policeman.', 'This is somewhat of a strawman.\n\nPeople aren\'t saying that these gun deaths are unimportant - what they\'re doing is focus on the most marketable issue first. ""Stop people from killing themselves"" is not as catchy as ""stop people from going into schools and shooting our children"".', 'Mass shootings are a very important part of the discussion because they‚Äôre the only kind of shooting some people care about.\n\nA lot of people dismiss suicides as ‚Äúgoing to happen anyway‚Äù (not what the evidence says but that‚Äôs another story). They also tend to dismiss homicides as being ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù like gang violence (also not factually true but still a common myth).\n\nMass shootings are different. You know that most of the victims are totally innocent people just going about their lives. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúthey were asking for it by engaging in risky behavior‚Äù. Those elementary school students don‚Äôt deserve to die. No one can reasonably argue they do.\n\nMass shootings are far from the greatest threat of gun culture in the US. You‚Äôre absolutely right. However, we don‚Äôt talk about them because they‚Äôre the biggest threat. We talk about them because they‚Äôre a threat that is harder to dismiss out of ignorance than other gun deaths and casualties.\n\nWhen trying to convince someone, you use what will actually convince them even if it‚Äôs not the strongest argument from a logical or data-driven perspective.', '[removed]', '[deleted]', '[deleted]', '""I\'d rather people stop discussing the dozens of gun deaths, alongside the mass terror, as a point when discussing the significant problem of firearms violence.""', 'Rarity is relative - no other modern developed country has a comparable problem like this - even when scaled for population', 'I\'m basing my views on [this survey.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx)\n\nThe number I found most compelling is the survey data on handgun possession versus assault rifle possession. A relatively low (27%) number of people are in favor of handgun bans. On the flipside, a majority (55%) are in favor of assault rifle bans, and the same number are in favor of banning high capacity magazines.\n\nMass shootings serve as a useful way to enact the laws that people *do* want, which mainly center on the goal ""don\'t give mentally ill people large guns.""', ""Sound logic. Car safety should not analyze car crashes. Police training shouldn't look at potential conflicts. Doctor training shouldn't look at operations. Why look at solving potential problems when you can just pretend they don't exist?"", '>  I don\'t buy the argument that firearms are going to stop a dictatorship or whatever\n\nWhy do you not buy this argument?\n\nThe typical rebuttal goes something like ""guns are no match against nukes, tanks, fighter jets, and battleships, checkmate!"" This is of course true, guns cannot defeat heavy military equipment like that. But, that stuff is useful for two main things - fighting other militaries and destroying infrastructure. That is not the type of force that a dictator needs to enforce his control over his own population. History is full of examples of ragtag populations with guns only defeating powerful militaries - it\'s happened to us multiple times! \n\nThe dictator is not going to want to drop a nuke on Fort Worth if they decide they\'re not loyal to him anymore. He\'s not going to try to blockade the Chesapeake Bay, or establish air superiority over Florida, or shell his own military installations with tanks. If he does those things - spoiler alert - all the innocent people who aren\'t involved in the rebellion die too, and then he\'s got no population and no infrastructure left to rule over. \n\nTo control a population the dictator needs boots on the ground maintaining order and enforcing his rules. He needs to be able to clear protests, find the people plotting against him, search people\'s homes for contraband, and generally maintain a level of fear amongst the population. He can\'t do that with a fighter jet - he does it by pointing guns at the population right there in their communities and telling them ""obey me or you\'ll be shot.""\n\nHistory tells us that it\'s pretty easy for a dictator with a loyal police force to accomplish this when facing an unarmed population. But if the people can shoot back, it\'s not so easy. Nobody\'s signing up to go enforce some rule like ""no Western movies or music allowed"" if they know there\'s a high probability they get their face turned into tomato soup the first time they try it. \n\n*That* is why we own guns. Nobody\'s even going to bother trying to conquer and subdue the American people because it cannot be done when we\'ve got >1 guns per person to go around. \n\nTo the rest of your point, I completely agree that focusing on statistical outliers is a terrible way to argue your position on how to solve a problem.', ""Mass shootings are very much topic of debate for gun control when the leading cause of death in Americas youth up to the age of 19 is firearm related ([https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2201761](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2201761))  \n\n\nIt would be the same concern, and is, that we see a rise and spike of youth overdosing on fentanyl and other deadly drugs that have seen a similar jump as firearms. \n\nWe are much more responsive to those issues than we seem to be concerned with gun killings, and that is an issue absolutely worth bringing up. Sure more adults die to drug overdoses and die in car crashes, and legislations should focus on that majority, but its the odd statistics that we're seeing effecting just the youth in our country that definitely warrant attention and change."", 'I think the problem with this country is that deaths by firearm are so commonplace they don‚Äôt even make the news anymore. Mass shootings, however, are so heinous that they are far more newsworthy. Gun legislation has no choice but to be motivated by these horrible crimes. If we had done something *real* after Columbine, maybe we could‚Äôve saved some lives. In 20 years, we‚Äôll be having the same discussion about Uvalde. Bottom line, as long as there are mass shootings, they‚Äôre going to be a part of all gun control talk.', ""A mass shooting doesn't have to result in deaths to be tragic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that a mass shooting is considered a normal yearly (heck monthly) statistic is what is wrong and maybe that's why you see so much focus around it. \n\nThey happen enough that shooter drills are happening in schools. Shooter drills in schools are not normal.\n\nFeeling that having armed guards to prevent them (or having teachers armed) is not normal. In a developed country like the US, that type of basic safety shouldn't be a concern. \n\nEasy gun availability ensures a way higher success in suicide rates, that's for sure. And that's pretty tragic considering that 9 out of 10 people who attempt once (and fail) will not attempt again. \n\nAnd i'm not talking about removing guns (like we're doing in Canada). I'm talking about having checks and mandatory training in place (criminal, background, mental health, etc). The delay itself could be enough to save someone with suicidal thoughts in the spur of the moment"", 'A side note really: I am not sure your realise how totally nuts it sounds to a non-US national for you to make out that 100 deaths a year from mass shooting is an insignificant number.', ""Mass shootings take place in locations where people have a reasonable expectation of being safe: schools, supermarkets, churches, malls, concerts, etc.\n\nMost gun violence that is not classified as a mass shooting takes place in locations where people know there is a danger. I know not to be in certain areas of my city, especially in darkness.\n\nPeople should have an expectation of safety in areas we frequent, during normal hours. It is appropriate that we spend more time and resources to ensure this. So I disagree with you about the ratio of our attention. That's not to say we ignore other gun violence. We don't, we devote enormous resources in policing, and safety measures.\n\nOne is an intractable problem common to almost every country, one is a problem in which the US is an outlier among developed countries.""]"

Should gun suicides be counted as gun violence? Should they be used to justify gun control?,"I've noticed that the pro and anti gun crowds appear to be at an impasse regarding suicide via gun. Specifically whether or not suicides count as gun violence and ought to be used to justify gun control.

The pro gun crowd argues that suicides should not count as gun violence because we don't call suicide by other methods rope/knife/pill/whatever violence. Guns are singled out. They argue that this is done in order to inflate gun violence numbers for purposes of fear mongering since a lot of people mentally picture gun homicide when they hear the term ""gun violence"" It is also true that the majority of gun deaths are suicides.

They also argue that since suicide is a self directed action and can be accomplished without a gun, it shouldn't be used to justify stronger gun control. Finally, they argue that the government's job isn't to protect people from themselves.

The anti gun crowd, meanwhile argues that violence directed against oneself is still violence. They also believe that most suicides are impulsive and access to a gun makes attempts more likely to occur and succeed. Suicide also impacts more than just the person taking their life. It impacts friends and family as well.

Overall they believe preventing a suicide is just as valueble as preventing a homicide.

"Gun control advocates don't want solutions, they just want gun control for gun control's sake. They don't care about addressing the root problems of gun violence, and are fundamentally dismissive of all other possible solutions.","In a post here the other day, I found out about the profile that two professors had created, analyzing every mass shooting since 1966 and every school and workplace shooting regardless of size since 1999, interviewing failed mass shooters, interviewing family of shooters etc.

It really was a fascinating read and it make me realize that we really can treat mass shootings as a mental health issue, because the large majority of shooters fit a specific biographical and behavioral profile that includes a number of mental health issues and warning signs.

[https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/stopping-mass-shooters-q-a-00035762](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/stopping-mass-shooters-q-a-00035762)

Since finding this out, I've gone on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook trying to share this article and discuss with liberal/progressive/Democratic folks ways to use this to address gun violence.

. . .nobody cared.  I found a constant stream of being dismissive of the article, the profile, and the very idea of treating gun violence as a mental health issue. . .and pretty much every one who commented just insisted that the only POSSIBLE solution was more gun control, the more the better.

Instead, I heard the following (a selection of dismissals or counter-arguments I received):

* ""We can't do anything about mental health problems because Republicans won't let us, so we'll have to ban assault rifles.""
* ""That article is just NRA propaganda to distract people from our need for gun control.""
* ""Interesting, but we can't test for craziness, so we'll have to do other things.  I propose magazine size restrictions.""
* ""The profile is nonsense and only fits maybe 20% of shooters, and doing anything based on that profile is illegal anyway.  We'd be better off to ban AR-15's.""
* ""This is just a Republican distraction away from the real issue of how we need to ban assault rifles.""

It was a pretty consistent drum-beat of people ignoring the entire idea of addressing the root causes and looking for warning signs (when studies of shooters have shown what those warning signs are) and saying that because nothing else can be done, we MUST take sweeping gun control measures.

It's frustrating, because I went to lengths to point out how the profile shows some obvious signs to watch out for, like multiple failed suicide attempts (the profile concludes that mass shootings are effectively a suicide attempt unto themselves), and that many shooters (especially the younger shooters) explicitly tried to reach out for help before turning to shootings but their efforts to get help were rebuffed (in one extreme case, an individual tried to call a behavioral health facility immediately before shooting, when they couldn't get through, they opened fire).

It's like it's an unquestionable axiom to them that guns are bad, that gun control is good, and the ONLY possible solution to mass shootings is sweeping gun control and any other solution or response is purely GOP/NRA propaganda.",v96vnb,707,299,https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/comments/v96vnb/gun_control_advocates_dont_want_solutions_they/,"['It‚Äôs the same with abortion on the right.

We need proper firearm training, proper storage, background checks in a linked system that covers everybody- police- govt agents, military etc and includes a social media sweep, registration for firearms- similar to a car, no transfer or gun show background check loopholes, and personally I feel that a gun owner should be held financially responsible for any damage caused by their gun- mandatory liability insurance- more guns you own would probably mean higher premiums. CCW =\nHigher premiums that could be subsidized by your employer if you need to carry for your job.  DV issues should include partners not just spouses for background checks. I think large capacity magazines need regulated along with some types of ammunition. We own multiple firearms-some were family hand me downs and some were purchased by our family. We don‚Äôt use firearms for personal or home defense. We use other measures.

It not necessarily that they don\'t care about the underlying issues, it\'s that they don\'t want to wait for those to be fixed. \n\nThe problem is that their proposed fix likely wouldn\'t be very effective. They don\'t have a magic button that would immediately take guns away from people, which is essentially the only way to achieve their goal in the United States.\n\nEdit: also, looking at the proposals flying around in the Canadian government it\'s pretty clear what happens when gun control gets increased: it never stops increasing. Hearing Trudeau propose *even stricter* measures in a country that already has incredibly strict gun control, with barely even a fraction of gun violence the United States sees, and essentially no mass shootings (in the sense of ""active shooter"" situations), really pissed me off. It didn\'t even happen in his country, and his country doesn\'t have the same problem, but he still wants to increase gun control? Why? The only answer is that he, and others like him, simply don\'t think guns should be accessible to average people, which is, in my opinion, a morally reprehensible stance.', ""I think America is reaching some spiral.\n\nRight wingers love to point at Chicago murder rates but never discuss how it is due to extrajudicial killings done because residents don't trust the police to serve justice.\n\nSo now we have record low trust in police nationally.

Even if you mention that once the right to bare arms goes away; that every other right can then easily be taken away as only the government will have the power of force.

We have to be tough on crime.   Stop the slaps on the wrists that are encouraging people to commit more and more crime, everything from the petty crime on up.   I‚Äôm all for first time offenders for petty crimes to be given leniency but we are now at a point where people have committed dozens of crimes and are still being given minor slaps.  California let two violent felons out (brothers), who then went and committed a mass shooting, just a few weeks ago.   Why? \n2. To go along with #1, make using guns in crimes undesirable.   If you‚Äôre caught using a gun in the commission of a felony; add 15 years to their sentence without the possibility of parole.   If that gun is stolen, or you‚Äôre a forbidden person, then that increases to 25 years.  This is on top of any other sentence given for the crime.\n3. Require that any credible threat be added to the do-not-purchase list for firearms.   Specifically for school administrators, police, and government agencies.   Many of the last shootings would have been stopped if one of those agencies had done this.   Parkland was known to the school, he had brought a weapon to school before, and was known to the FBI.   Yet was not added to the list, this is unacceptable.   \n4. Close private sales.  This is NOT a loophole, this was a compromise given to pass the first assault weapons ban.  But things have changed, and it is time too close it.  But it should NOT be closed like they do in California.   In CA it is required that every sale go through an FFL and pay a $30ish fee.   In reality, the FFLs don‚Äôt want to take your business, so they make you wait hours and hours because you‚Äôre not a priority, then they charge fee upon fee, often making it $150 instead of $30 (even though CA law says they can only charge the $30, they add storage fees, handling fees, and more).   This should be done via the internet.  A person wants to buy a gun, they go online, fill out the paperwork to do so and have the background check done.   Once they are approved, they will be given a unique identifier.  They take that identifier to the seller, who plugs it into their phone and they verify the buyers name and address (online to their license).   And that‚Äôs it.  This could also be used for all gun purchases to streamline the FFL process.  And those who don‚Äôt have internet or don‚Äôt want do that, can go through an FFL.\n5. Improve our schools.   This is more for helping our society as a whole, but improving our schools, and teaching kids how to be good people along the way.   All schools should be working to not only prepare people for the future but also give them hope, opportunity and even support.  This means a lot more funding to schools.  And it requires that everyone push themselves to WANT to be educated, this is the key to improving life for EVERYONE.\n6. Mental and Physical health needs to be addressed, these systems have been gutted for decades now, it is wrong.   We also must make it normalized for people to SEEK help instead of laughing at them.   We need to not hold it against someone if they seek help.   If someone goes to a psychologist to get help because they lost their parents, and they are depressed, it should not remove their rights forever.\n7. Violent culture has to be stopped.   I‚Äôm not saying action movies should be banned, I‚Äôm talking about the aspect where some people thing it is cool to have been in jail, that it is a badge of honor.  It isn‚Äôt, it should be something people should be ashamed of.  Being mean and aggressive is considered good in some cases, that has to end.   Nothing wrong with standing up for yourself, but causing violence is not.   This HAS to end.\n8. Equality for everyone, and true equality.  This is hard outside of schools and the justice system because people have their own beliefs, but it should be taught in schools and held true in the justice system.   If people from Race A and B both commit the same crime, and all things are basically equal, then they should get the same punishment.  Justice should be blind.   Education the same, it should be blind.\n9. NFA items must be re-evaluated.   Machine guns should be available, but controlled, much more along the lines of how we do silencers.   Silencers should be available to everyone; they are safety equipment, nothing more.   \n10. National concealed carry permits should be created.   To obtain one, an individual must go through an extensive background check, pass a safe handling test, attend 40 hours of class time and carry insurance.   Every state and territory MUST recognize this card.\n\nI may have missed some things, and am always tweaking.  But I think that if we went down this road and made these changes, this country would improve tremendously.', 'I‚Äôve also heard of studies indicating that only 4% of violent offenders have diagnosable mental health issues. \n\nEven the ‚Äúschool shooter type‚Äù angry kid who gets bullied doesn‚Äôt necessarily have a diagnosable mental health condition, he‚Äôs just an angry kid.

Our disagreements come from different beliefs about how to achieve those goals. Sometimes those beliefs are based in plain ignorance, but keep in mind, ignorance isn\'t a moral failing--it\'s literally just not knowing something. \n\nThe debate around gun control primarily centers around one thing: safety.

They *do* care about addressing the root problems of gun violence.\n\nPut yourself in their shoes for a second. They know *nothing* about guns except that a specific gun has enabled a handful of people to murder a bunch of children, which is something *nobody* wants to happen.\n\nIf they have any other information about guns or AR-15s, it\'s often from sources like the guy who insisted on separating kids from their parents on the border or the guy who thinks miscarriages are murder. The real problems that AR-15s solve, like controlling packs of feral hogs or forming a well-regulated militia, seem far-fetched when you live in a upper-middle-class suburb of an economically-advantaged city.

If it\'s possible at all to get gun control advocates to discuss other solutions, that starts by persuading them that we\'re on the same team: us versus mass shootings, instead of that we\'re just pro-gun nuts who don\'t care when kids die. And that change has to start with us: we can\'t find our shared values if we don\'t believe we share any values with them.\n\nIt\'s hard, I know.

Just like the Right wing groups push their own shortsighted talking points. Fear this, push for that.

My fear is that this frustration will keep building, and not giving any concessions in the now, may lead to forced larger concessions down the line that we will REALLY hate. I don't know what the solution is. Maybe the left needs a populist style candidate to force through a proper Healthcare system and support structure and welfare for these people who are hurting. Right now, I have to live in fear that my son could die in a school shooting. Do I feel like that would actually happen? No. But so did the Uvalde parents.

The columbine shooters have their own cult following just like Hitler or psychopaths have. News coverage is to blame for that. Poor education on guns is also a huge problem. People treat firearms like toys. A pink .38 is no more a toy than a bomb is. People need to start taking guns more seriously. I don\'t know exactly how to cause this.

This has definitely become two idiots yelling at each other.', ""Why put more laws and regulations in place when the FB fucking I doesn't already follow protocol already?"", 'there are things we can do about mass shootings without resorting to the tired old gun debate:\n\nWhen a mass shooting occurs the media tells us 3 things ASAP. How many people were killed, what was used and who did it. Then they rank these against other shooters in a sick grotesque scoreboard against other mass shootings.\nThe attention the shooter gets glorifies him in the eyes of other sad lonely vulnerable people and this encourages them to commit copycat crimes to achieve the same result for themselves. This is a process known as the media contagion effect.\nI\'m not just talking about my ass here this is a well understood scientific phenomenon and scientists are certain it plays a large factor in causing mass shootings http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/08/media-contagion.aspx\nMedia contagion effect also increases the odds of terrorists attacking because it lets them know they WILL get a platform to push their message from the media http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/73/html \nso what can we do? in the 1980s the media contagion effect was causing teenagers to commit suicide in record numbers because they wanted attention and saw all the other teen victims on TV and said ""i want to be remembered like that"" http://www.ensani.ir/storage/Files/20110209140608-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA%20%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%20%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C%20%D9%88%20%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84%20%D8%AF%D8%B1%20%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%20%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86.pdf\nbut we did something about it, enraged parents wrote angry letters to cnn and msn and other outlets they DEMANDED they stop showing the faces and names of the victims and now it is a quasi law among journalists not to do so. We can achieve this again.\nthe solution is not to stop reporting on the issue but ""victim centered reporting"" focusing on the victims and NEVER releasing the name or face of the shooter will stop copycat crimes and encourage sympathy rather than envy among vulnerable populations of would be shooters\n', 'What specific rules, that are actually plausible, would have prevented this?\n\nAnd does that rule already exist in some form or another?\n\nIt\'s really as simple as this: A person with no criminal record or history of mental illness should be able to purchase a semi automatic rifle. Why? Semi automatic simply means you don\'t have to manually pump or pull each round into the gun\'s chamber. Most guns you imagine are semi automatic. Being black and military styled is just about appearance. Your dads hunting rifle could be semi automatic. And chances are a basic 12 gauge pump action shotgun could have been just as, if not more, damaging to people than the AR that these psychos seem to all be so obsessed with. \n\nSo what\'s the law that\'s supposed to prevent this? No more high capacity magazines? Honestly fine by me at this point because it\'s not a serious impediment to a persons right to defend themselves. But I really don\'t think it will help. You can just buy a few magazines. These people don\'t pick targets that shoot back so they can easily just change magazines when they run out, even if limited to 10 bullets each. \n\nAside from that, we can talk about straw purchases and gun shows and assault weapon classification all we want but the fact remains that all those conversations are rendered moot by what these guys are actually doing. They are preying upon the trully helpless. Are they using weapons that questionably can or should be restricted? Sure but could they do that same thing with weapons that can\'t be restricted? Yes. And that the real problem here. \n\nThis becomes a debate about certain types of policies that are only tangentially related to the actual cause of the debate on the first place. \n\n""Oh no another school shooting"" turns into a conversation on why we need stricter laws to prevent gun runners from using guns shows to sell to drug dealers. \n\nThis is not a problem that\'s going to ever be solved if we maintain this habitual cycle of responses.', '[deleted]', ""Every single discussion about gun violence:\n\n*<a single issue>* is the answer to the problem! if all yalls would just look at *<a single issue>* and solve it, gun violence would stop!

Mentally ill people in other countries don\'t go attacking people in the streets, or bombing schools with IEDs (and believe me, it is terrifying how easy those things are to make.) The point being the amount of violent *attempts* in other countries don\'t even begin to match the amount of shootings in America. That means there is something unique in the American culture that is influencing them. \n\n\nA gun is a neutral object. Some say it should be banned, others say it is a right, but regardless of your view, we can agree that a gun is a neutral object. They merely carry out the will of the person holding it.\n\nGuns are not the determining factor whether or not someone will carry out a school shooting. If it is true that the problem is mental illness, then we would hear more about *attempts* in other countries. The only differing factor is the existence of guns possibly increasing their success rate, but a truly mentally ill individual does not gauge their attempts based on chance of success. That would imply these individuals are not truly mentally ill, but rather of very sound mind, with a goal to harm people.\n\nDo not misunderstand me, I\'m not advocating for or against guns.

It's all fear mongering. \n\nWhy do you need a weapon that shoots 100 rounds per minute to hunt???\n\nHonestly Id be fine banning everything except revolvers, shotguns, and bolt action rifles. That's all you need for protection and hunting. Everything else is just designed to kill massive amounts of people. \n\nThe US is a laughing stock to the rest of the world with our love of guns"", ""There's not a single democrat politician that's advocating for a total gun ban. And personally I've yet to met a democrat, liberal, or leftist that believes all guns should be banned. The right constantly misrepresents the lefts views.

To entertain your question: You could hunt with bows, spears, javelins, slings, you could place snares but, strictly speaking, that's trapping rather than hunting.\n\nTo point out the obvious follow up: yes all of those could also be used to kill humans as well but they are more conspicuous than a small firearm and are less convenient to use in a fit of road rage (for example) though arguably they could be used for home defense, though they are, to reiterate, more difficult and less convenient to use than a firearm."", ""If I did, I'd tell you to be a real man and do it with a bow and arrow.  You want to be one with nature, do away with the gun powder."", 'I am not sure you can find any such person to ask. At least,  not in America.', 'I‚Äôve never actually met a person in real life who supports a complete ban on firearms. I have never in my life seen a poll that suggests that there is any appetite whatsoever for a complete ban on guns. I have never in my life seen a politician elected to higher office who supports a complete ban on firearms, it would be political suicide. Barack Obama was the most progressive president that we have had in the history of our nation and he was in office during the worst mass shooting in the history of our nation, he did nothing. I just don‚Äôt get how this trope about liberals taking away guns has been going strong for almost 40 years. Isn‚Äôt the test of time enough to make you realize that you‚Äôve been bamboozled? If we actually had this insatiable thirst to confiscate all firearms wouldn‚Äôt we have made a move by now? Why would we just sit back secretly in the shadows plotting to snatch up all the guns and not actually elect people to Congress who support banning guns? We have already proven with our votes that we do not support banning guns, time and time again.

But to answer your question. \n\nUse the bow and arrow.', 'I wouldn‚Äôt mind a complete ban but I‚Äôm realistic. There‚Äôs no way the government would be able to take guns away. I‚Äôm in favor of banning military style weapons and banning the manufacturing of ammunition for said weapons.\n\nNobody needs to hunt.\n\nI‚Äôd absolutely vote for a complete ban on all guns if it were on the ballot but it would by symbolic because there‚Äôs no way it would pass.', 'Don\'t support, but could imagine something like ""rent a gun"" to hunt.', 'There are no serious calls for a complete ban. There are calls for complete bans on various popular kinds of guns, such as ""assault weapons"" and handguns, and further categories once they get that, and to make ownership of the remaining guns so expensive that the poor need not even try. Basically, guns are only for the rich, strictly regulated.', 'One solution is to use a system like the present driving car requirements, prove you can drive, not have a record, and have insurance. Requiring insurance would be a good way to weed out unworthy gun owners much as it had with cars. They would need to pass a test to ensure they understand the law, have a good history of gun ownership, and have insurance for liability if the gun harms anyone.', 'Fuck gun control, where is gun abolition?

Besides, if somebody is responsible enough to own a gun then they can probably handle the responsibility of going to a grocery store.   \n  \n/s  \n  \nMore seriously: Hardly anybody wants a complete ban on guns.  The most popular policy proposal is a ban on semiautomatic rifles, and if the last ban on semiautomatic rifles is any precedent then existing owners will be grandfathered in.  While semiautomatic rifles can be and are sometimes used for hunting they are far from the only option hunters have, manual action firearms wouldn't be affected by a ban on semiautomatic rifles."", ""You don't need an AK for hunting, that's for sure."", 'Gun hunters are pussies, use a bow like a man.', '[deleted]', ""My knee jerk response is FK hunting with guns period. This is no longer a time when people rely on hunting to survive.  It is a gross and unnecessary activity. America has a cultural problem where people want to fantasize they are wild west cowboys. We aren't. I haven't a clue if we can ever get out of the hole we have dug yourselves into but we certainly could make things better. You don't kill the good for lack of the perfect. The NRA is all about profit and has done incredible harm to the USA. They have blocked research into preventing gun violence, from doctors discussing gun dangers with their patients, from putting tracers into ammo so murderers might be caught, from putting on child safety measures. It is beyond ridiculous what our country has become because of the all mighty dollar.\n\nWe are not going to rid ourselves of the 2nd amendment in my life time so this question is gratuitous at best but I can still use it to let off steam."", 'I‚Äôd support repealing the 2nd amendment, and treating gun ownership as a privilege with heavy restrictions on the types allowed to be sold, and I‚Äôm pretty extreme.\n\nYou won‚Äôt find anyone arguing for a blanket ban, at least not seriously.', 'Crossbows, Regular bows, Spears, etc', ""Killing animals as a leisure activity always struck me as a barbaric.\n\nHowever, from an ethical perspective it's no worse than eating meat, and I'm not a vegetarian."", ""You don't hunt with a gun, you hunt with a rifle.

In the thousands of years before that, our ancestors used a plethora of other weapons and tactics to hunt with. (My 9 year old nephew just got an 8 point buck using a crossbow!)
