I want to burn my school down. Seriously.,"My school is toxic as hell. I hate everyone there. All the kids in my class are rude to me. I've tried everything to stop them. Asking them to stop, telling my teachers about it, telling the principal, but they don't do shit. I told my mom and she's emailed my teacher and the school so many times, but nothing as actually happened. I'm so done with them. I am going to bring a knife to school and stab all of them. I hope that they never see their family again. I hope that they all drown and suffer. I want to burn their houses down. I want them to die and to never be missed. I will kill them. None of them have loving parents, siblings, all of their grandparents are dead, and they don't deserve to be alive. They should have been aborted. I hope they get kidnapped. I will not reply to you.",1b1vxfg,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1b1vxfg/i_want_to_burn_my_school_down_seriously/,[]

Recover data widely deleted on an encrypted volume,"Hi there.  
I have a Synology Nas with DSM 6.2 running.  
On it, i have an encrypted volume. I can mount it, i have no access problems.  
The problem is that i manually deleted everything on it, i emptied trash bin and desactivated snapshots.  


I would like to recover data from it, but the only tool that was able to produce anything was EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, i used it from Windows.  
I was able to connect to the volume on the Nas and analyze it, but i had to abort it since every data and files found were like encrypted.  
They had random names and could not be previewed.  


Is there a way, a tool to recover some data on this volume ?  
Can i recover encrypted lost data with EaseUS tool and decrypt them in some way ?  
Maybe another clue:   
Deleted snapshots freed space on the volume but i still can see them on the Synology Drive app.  
I mean i still can see my folders trees and files in their old states, but can't restore them ofc, since desactivating snapshots deleted them.  


Thanks for your help.  🙏

PVR Landing Incident,"Last week, we were on a flight to Puerto Vallarta. During the landing, while we were quite close to the runway,  the plane banked strongly in one direction, and then violently in the other before aborting the landing and taking off again. We circled back and landed successfully on the second attempt. The pilot said they had encountered another airplane at the last moment. This does not sound legit.we were way to close to the runway for them to just suddenly notice another plane. Also, it wasn't changing direction to avoid collision, it felt like a loss of control and an overcorrection. 

I am curious of records of these events are kept by either the airport or air line carrier. Would this reports, if they exist, be available to the public?

Listen to your body. ,"I had a medical abortion via pill on February 3rd well this past Thursday I went in because my bleeding had tapered off then I started getting massive clots for days after 4 days and getting sharp pains and shoulder pain I went to my OB and discovered not all the tissue had passed after having her reach in and literally grab it out the bleeding slowed and basically has stopped now but it could have been much different I could have gone septic (started antibiotics as a precaution) and things could have ended very badly for me. Please make sure if something feels wrong don’t wait and seek help immediately. If you’re afraid to say you had an abortion simply say you had a miscarriage. 

Also just wanted to add you don’t owe anyone an explanation for doing what is best for you. In my circumstances I just had a baby a couple months ago, having another right now in this economy is just not in the card and yes I used protection and on birth control- life can still happen.

The boomers won't get it until it threatens them or someone they love directly ,"Work in the OR in Tx, and many of the surgeons are boomers. Some are fairly chill, some are pretty crusty, virtually all of them some degree of conservative. Worked with a podiatrist today, whom I know to be very christian conservative, pro-Trump, Steve Bannon fan, MAGA all the way etc. That is, until I heard him go off on abortion and maternity rights. 

""That AG Ken Paxton should be ashamed, and in jail! And the Medical Association, we should have called in all our members en masse and gone down and protested til he fully understood the consequences to the women here in the state if this degree of medical care isn't provided to women. That Katey Cox case just showed his true colors, and states like Idaho and Tennessee are only making it worse!""

I had to ask him what made him have such an opinion, as for a red state like Texas it's pretty radical, perhaps not for California or Colorado but def Texas. Turns out, his daughter recently gave birth at a later age, and had some complications during her pregnancy and he was justly worried about her progress the entire time. It all turned out fine but he talked about even going so far as looking at buying property out of state so the family could 'take a vacation' in case they recieved any bad news that had to be taken care of.

I personally was quite stunned by the route this story had gone, but looking back I guess it isn't too hard to see the seismic shift that will have to go to change a person's, and by extension an entire generation's mind. Change may not be apparent, but once the rubber starts to seriously hit the road for some people and its no longer an academic argument but part of one's personal story that's when things will start to move.

Relationship following MA with life threatening complications - Help/Advice,"My Girlfriend and I recently underwent a MA which resulted in her being hospitalized for 4 days one week following the MA due to an infection from remnants of conception remaining in her uterus.

Early into our relationship Her and I had a very direct conversation on what our plan would be if she were to become pregnant. We both mutually agreed that we were not at the point in our lives where we wanted children and that we would terminate. Literally fast forward 3 weeks following this discussion, we found out she was pregnant. Once we suspected possibility of pregnancy her and I again sat down and had another discussion on the topic now that this was becoming a reality and we ensured each other again it was what we both wanted. The next day she took a test and confirmed she was in fact pregnant. We ordered through HeyJane and waited for the medication to arrive Via the mail.

While we waited she was struck with horrible morning sickness and would rarely want to leave the house. During this time I tried to be as supportive and comforting to her as possible, trying to provide whatever she needed to comfort her and just be there for emotional support. She is generally pretty closed off and any discussion attempted to be had on my end to check in on her was quickly shot down, so I took this as a sign to let her process on her own, while doing my best to let her know I was there for her if she needed me. The medication finally arrived, I let her know I would be willing to spend time with her and stay with her while she did the MA, however she insisted she wanted to be alone, so I again let her know I was there and she went through with the MA. Prior to the MA she would say how much ""she hated feeling like this"" and that ""she didn't feel like herself"" so when the symptoms and morning sickness went away The 5 days following the MA were a 180, she said she immediately felt back to normal and she asked if we could go out and get our relationship back on track. We spent the weekend together went out on two date nights and felt our connection as it always was.

However, one week following the MA, she was struck with a fever of 103, extensive bleeding and was rushed to the hospital by a friend and received emergency surgery. She was entering septic shock when she arrived. I immediately went down to the hospital and stayed with her all night following the emergency surgery. Due to her severe infection doctors made her stay for the remainder of the week. The first night in the hospital I let her know I was worried but that I was there for her and tried to show some vulnerability to her so she would feel comfortable opening up to let out anything that was on her mind. She snapped on me and told me that everything was fine and that it was not a big deal that she was there and that she didn't have anything to say. It crushed me, but I suppressed my feeling because I understood everyone processes on there own. Taking this as a sign I kept the remainder of my time in the hospitals light and did my best to not bring up the matter any more, as she requested.

fast forward to the week following her discharge, she planned a trip to her home state and the day prior told me she felt we processed things differently and that she did not feel we should have to accommodate or change the way's we are to support one another and she wanted some space during her trip home. I respected her wishes and gave her the two weeks and just sent one message letting her know I was thinking of her during the trip. Upon her return she sent a text message essentially saying she wanted to heal on her own without expectations. 

I responded telling her I respected her decision, I loved her, and that if she ever needs anything to never hesitate to reach out. It has since been a month and I am still beating my self up. I have continued to give her space and have not reached out out of complete respect for her decision to heal on her own.

Throughout the entirety of the process I tried my best to be accommodating, understanding, supportive, and just be present for her and I feel like I totally failed her. I feel my personal anxiety attached to the situation and just being genuinely caring and concerned to show up for her pushed her away entirely, ultimately hurting her and ruining our relationship. I will not claim to be perfect throughout this, I can even say myself that potentially my actions of talking or asking how she was doing could be overbearing at times, but every step of the way I did my best to adjust and just be the best partner I could be for her. 

Part of me want's to reach out, part of me feels like I have to move on, part of me feels like once she is comfortable she will reach out on her own. I began to feel distance that first night in the hospital but prior to that our relationship had only ever experienced one minor disagreement. Our connection and communication was incredible but this crippled us. Has anyone experienced this from either perspective male or female who can give some insight?

&#x200B;

TLDR: GF got a MA, she was hospitalized a week later for a severe infection of her uterus, following the hospitalization she asked for space, I respected that and now we are separated.

I am missing a decent bit of context, if anything seems unclear or off please let me know.

How can I run x64 Windows 10/11 inside a virtual machine on Apple Silicon,"This post is for other people like me looking to run x64 Windows apps on Apple Silicon Macs. I did the research, so you don't have to. Especially engineering students who work with FPGAs and microcontrollers like ESP32.

I've tried everything. UTM, VMWare Fusion, Parallels Desktop, VirtualBox. You will not be able to get a x64 Windows system inside a virtual machine working in a usable state on Apple Silicon. I got curious and waited it out, it took more than 2 hours for Windows setup wizard load up to ask for my region. At that point, I aborted the process and gave up on x64 Windows.

Best thing you can do is getting an ARM build of Windows 11 and running that inside a virtual machine. ARM Windows have a compatibility layer that lets you run x86/64 apps and it's surprisingly pleasant in my opinion. In my experience, Parallels Desktop works especially well for running ARM Windows on Apple Silicon. If you only want to use Windows-exclusive software on your Mac and don't need to work with external hardware, this is as good as it gets. However, you will encounter all sorts of problems when you try to actually program a microcontroller from your Mac, because, well, the drivers that interface with these microcontrollers are only made with x64 Windows machines in mind, or so I've found out. You can either get UTM and CrystalFetch, and install ARM Windows 11 all for free for a dodgy user experience, or shell out money for Parallels and an ARM Windows 11 Pro license (if you don't know how to activate Win11 without a key of course). For simulating things, all is well. If you actually need to program a microcontroller, you need an x64 Windows machine.",1b1tjk2,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1b1tjk2/how_can_i_run_x64_windows_1011_inside_a_virtual/,"[""You sort of answered your own question... can't be done."", 'You can’t.

Why are there so many single issue Israel/Palestine voters?,"There appear to be substantial numbers of people who plan to sit out the election or vote for a candidate other than Biden because of Israel/Palestine. I'm not here to argue whether Biden has done a good or bad job, but I am curious to get into the mindset of people who think this way. 

Even if you believe Biden to be doing an absolutely horrendous job, or enabling an ongoing Israeli genocide, and believe that he is as bad as Trump on this issue, this is not the only issue that matters. In fact, I'd argue that Israel/Palestine demonstrably does not matter more than every single other issue on the ballot this fall. And on every single other issue, there's acres of daylight between the candidates.

I think you get the point. So, once again, I'm not here to argue that Biden has been good on Israel/Palestine, or has done nearly enough to pressure Bibi.

Dear Sir,"You know for all years that I've been aware that you Sir listed on my birth certificate has called me a liar. This same man that brought me to his sister's house so that she can use her connections to give me an at home late term abortion. This was done without explaining what was happening nor asking a single question about how it had happened. I was never asked single question it was simply discovered that I was pregnant and I was given an abortion. I was left with a episiotomy scar that stretches 85 percent of my vaginal canal. You would not believe the look on my gynecologist's when I at 18 asked her what it was then why that happens. I believe you are a lot of things Sir but you are not my father. 
It's not that I distinctly remember you watching me be SA'd in your house. It's not that you told me that you paid my mother tens of thousands of dollars to get custody of me. It's not that you said as you were taking me to my new home that you had given me your last name now I had to earn it. It's not that weird shit that you gave me occasionally to ""clean me out"" and the way that your second and third wife flat out asked me if you were molesting me. It's not even way that you tell people that something happened to me when I was younger and ""she's been messed up ever since"" while simultaneously calling me a liar; evil; hateful. I can't see it.  I can't see you being my father and for that I thank God. I don't see you as a part of me and for that I am grateful. I don't want anything from you so leave me out of your last will and testament. I was sold to you, and treated like property. I wish you nothing; because you are nothing and whenever I hear you name in this life I will respond and react as if I heard nothing.

getting an abortion tomorrow,"hi im getting an abortion tomorrow at planned parenthood. my last period was about 9 weeks ago, and the period itself was abnormally short (\~3 days). this is kind of worrying me because im wondering would this count as my last period if it was really short? the period before that would be 15 weeks ago. im just feeling anxious about this in case im more far along than i thought. also what kind of exams do they do before the actual procedure? do they do an ultrasound to ensure how far along you are? im really anxious about this, any advice or information would be appreciated, thank you.

Weird message thingy that I don't know how to fix,"As you can tell from the title, I'm not super tech literate, but I modded my 3ds about a year or a year and a half ago, and I keep getting this weird unknown thing that I have no clue how to fix. This only happens when I try to get past a certain point in the game Dillon's dead heat breakers. I bought this game a few years before I modded my 3ds, and right after I had modded my 3ds it was even running fine for 2 or 3 hours of gameplay, until this had happened. I have seen this literally no where else online, I even went to the homebrew discord a while ago (I think? I know it was an official discord of something) and nobody there had seen or heard about this and couldn't fix it. Can anyone help me???? I just wanna play my game

"Pro lifers: if you don't want abortions, you can't have IVF","It's been interesting [watching republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/us/politics/embryos-ivf-alabama-republican-memo.html) [scramble to distance themselves](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/22/house-republicans-alabama-ivf-ruling) from the recent ruling out of Alabama that IVF embryos are ""children."" Even [Donald Trump has come out against it.](https://sourcenm.com/2024/02/26/trump-comes-out-against-alabama-ivf-ruling-as-national-republicans-scramble-for-distance/#:~:text=Former%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20called,the%20Alabama%20decision%20as%20well)

This makes no sense, however, since their position is that life begins *at conception.* A person's a person, no matter how small! God hath knitteth us all together in the womb! ""Even before ye were born, I knew ye"" and all that! An embryo is a *child.*

It is immensely politically unpopular to target IVF. So unpopular that this will probably cost you seats and power. However, that shouldn't matter if IVF involves killing *children.* Multiple embryos are produced during each round of IVF and studies show that [for every embryo that is gestated to term](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2255107/1-7-million-embryos-created-IVF-thrown-away-just-7-cent-lead-pregnancy.html), about 15 are made and about half of those are thrown away. *Murdered*, in cold blood. Tragic!

Those are precious, PRECIOUS children. Am I right? A child is a child is a *child.* And IVF involves the murder of millions of CHILDREN every year. There is no difference between an embryo in someone's uterus and in a petri dish except location, and as PLers are constantly reminding us, ""location"" should not determine the value of a *child.*

So clearly, PLers cannot have IVF. You simply cannot have it. Which means, given how unpopular this is, you cannot have power. 

Or, you can have IVF, but you have to admit to the American people and yourselves that you don't care about embryos, this is not about embryos, this was never about embryos and you never thought an embryo was a child. You simply want to punish women: for the sex they have, for being born with a uterus, and for not joyfully welcoming each and every precious, PRECIOUS child that takes up residence inside it.

After all, as our lord and savior Clyde Chambliss said, """"The egg in the lab doesn’t apply. It’s not in a woman. She’s not pregnant."" Right?",1b1spha,12,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebatingAbortionBans/comments/1b1spha/pro_lifers_if_you_dont_want_abortions_you_cant/,"['There is something that I both hate and admire about the religious right: their commitment to gaining power, even if it means making pragmatic moral compromises.\n\nIf they can’t ban abortion if they don’t make rape exceptions, they make rape exceptions.

Wealthy couples, many who may be PL sympathetic and may be the ones donating to you, use IVF.  The 10 living children that the CEO of X has all came from IVF.

You can’t simultaneously say it is a baby at conception, IVF kills babies and now, when that becomes flagrantly unpopular even among ostensibly pro-life people, try to walk that back.

20 and pregnant.  How to tell my parents?,"I just found out I’m pregnant.  I’m not married or engaged but my bf 29m and I are serious and we were planning to get married before the baby is born.  I’m very close with my parents despite living very far away from them so I would love to share the news with them.  I’m also so anxious about the entire situation and I would love some support from my mom.  I’ve only told two people other than my boyfriend and I know I need to hold off until I have a sonogram.  But this is the most lonely I’ve ever felt in my life.  We’re going to have to move, get married (in the Catholic Church so it’s much more complicated than simply going to the court house), and tell my family who will not be very supportive all before November. I’m so overwhelmed.

This type of situation is something my family is not used to.  They will be sad and disappointed and maybe even suggest abortion (something I am outwardly against).  This would hurt a lot and possibly change my relationship with them forever which I really don’t want.  I know they’ll eventually be supportive but I just can’t unhear my baby’s grandparents suggesting that I end his/her life so I want to go about telling them in a strategic way.  My bf suggests that we tell them once we’re engaged.  But I don’t know when that will be and I really want my parents to know.

Senate GOP poised to block IVF protection bill,"Senate conservatives are signaling they’ll block Wednesday’s planned Democratic bid to enshrine protections for in-vitro fertilization into federal law – and they’re calling IVF a states-rights issue.

Hyde-Smith’s office did not respond when asked if she would object again to Duckworth’s bill, and the GOP senator ignored Capitol hallway questions from reporters, as is her usual practice.

“I don’t see any need to regulate it at the federal level,” said Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), an OB-GYN by trade, who would not say whether he’d block the bill. “I think the Dobbs decision puts this issue back at the state level, and I would encourage your state legislations to protect in-vitro fertilization.”

“It’s idiotic for us to take the bait,” said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who clarified he was referring not to Duckworth’s bill on its face but to Democrats’ attempts to use the proposal as an IVF messaging tool. Vance said he’s not yet reviewed the actual bill.

Graham has not yet said whether he’ll object to the Duckworth bill.

“The Dobbs decision said that abortion is not part of the Constitution, and they said we’re sending the issue back to the states, and I think that’s where it belongs,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). “I believe that the people of Alabama – either themselves or through their legislature – will get something worked out that they’re comfortable with, but I do support fertility technology,” Kennedy added.

Of course, not all Republican senators believe IVF protection is a matter for the states. It’s no surprise, but Maine Sen. Susan Collins — one of the few Republicans who supports abortion access — supported the idea of federally protecting IVF.

“My hope is that either Alabama’s going to fix this very promptly or we pass federal legislation,” Collins said, adding she’s “completely open” to federal protections.",1b1s15c,43,16,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/inside-congress/2024/02/27/senate-gop-poised-to-block-ivf-protection-bill-00143645,"['And the reason behind this is that it is a ""state right issue"".\n\nWell, when have we heard this excuse before\n\nAlso, JD Vance already hating the bill DESPITE NOT READING IT YET\n\nNice to know words of supporting IVF by congressional Republicans (minus a few) were just words', 'Hold every GOP senator and senate candidate’s feet to the fire until they have an opinion on the record.

Do you know where you get your beliefs?,"I have done extensive research and am currently writing a paper on the origins of Anti-Abortion Rehtoric.

I have found that it is loosely inspired by A-list Greek philosophers and directly from B-list philosophers. Even analysis of the Bible and Torah have no backing for anti-abortion beliefs; they didn’t consider it a child till first breath, which is why it was only a fine to the father and not death penalty like if a new born was killed. 

The reason for the introduction of the first anti-abortion laws were about reproductive control, which is why Pope Gregory changed the no exceptions laws Pope Sixtus to only apply to religiously ordained fetuses, which occurred after the quickening — when movement could be felt by the mother. (This aligned more with the development of capabilities of consciousness, 20 weeks - 25 weeks.)

Another reason was control of education, and disdain for women.

Anyone able to foster a pregnant cat?,"I’ll keep this short and sweet.

I’ve been caring for a pregnant cat that showed up at my doorstep a few weeks ago. I had a feeling she was pregnant (i volunteered at shelters for 7 years) but wasn’t entirely sure and hoped I was wrong.

I’m not. She’s pregnant. Each day it’s more obvious. I’ve been feeding her daily and she is so so so sweet and affectionate. I unfortunately can’t bring her inside. I live in a tiny apartment with two male cats of my own and simply don’t have the space for her OR her oncoming kittens, on top of the fact that my cats will NOT take kindly to her. They hiss at her through the screen windows when they see her on the porch. 

I’ve called both last hope rescue and NSAL hoping they’d take her in. NSAL never called me back. Last Hope did, but said if they took her they’d be aborting her babies. I don’t know if I have the stomach to do that to her. It feels wrong. Pro choice when it comes to humans but something about not having mamas consent and her having zero knowledge of what they’d be doing to her doesn’t sit great with me :( I get why they do it, but I can’t be the one the pull the trigger.

The lady on the phone did however tell me if I call *after* she has babies, they’ll take mama and babies in if there’s room still. She’s about 3 weeks from popping if I had to guess.

Does any cat lovers out there on Long Island with time and space want to take a pregnant cat in to safely give birth? And hopefully have a place to take her after that happens? I can’t guarantee last hope will still have room so keep that in mind that if you take her you might be stuck with her and some adorable kittens for a bit. The coool thing about fostering a mama with her babies is that you don’t really need to do anything.. mom does all the work for you. Just keep her fed and hydrated and she does the rest! As long as the babies have a safe warm environment they’ll be okay!

Any help or advice greatly appreciated. Cat/animal lovers unite.

Constant B2 upload failures for 10TB file,"I’ve been trying to upload a 10TB file using both FileZilla Pro and the B2 Windows CLI for almost two weeks now, without success. 

FileZilla Pro’s problem is awful throughput despite tuning it to B2’s suggestions, or there will be a timeout from B2 when uploading that causes the transfer to abort. Uploading hundreds of smaller files (10-50GB) was no problem and was efficient with throughput. Around 300Mbps with multiple files going, on a commercial datacenter connection. But a 5TB barely finished and this 10TB can’t even get to 1TB. 

As for the B2 CLI, also at support’s suggestion, we tried changing the minimum chunk size and number of threads used. I can’t get more than about 130Mbps of throughput, the upload will fail after about 1-1.5TB. The failures are all “SSLEOFError.” Support has escalated this and said they could also recreate the problem, but hasn’t gotten back to me for a few days. 

I really want S3 to work for these larger files. I know it is possible. But I can’t understand all these different failures and how incapable support is of being helpful. This isn’t to say AWS S3 is flawless; but I’ve never had so much trouble that I’ve even had to contact Amazon support. 

So, I turn to Reddit in the hopes of finding some better help than official channels have been able to offer.

Hello everyone! I was one of the six students interviewed in a multiple hour long session last week (My comments didn't air). I noticed there were some misconceptions on where we came from as people and that lead to the frustration of some listeners. I just wanted to take the time to clear those misconceptions and thank you all for your feedback.    


""*I was screaming ""waaaah-waaah-waaah, shaddup!"" at my radio when I heard this. I too would like my perfect candidate handed to me on a plate but I'm choosing from the menu.*""   
\-**During the interview, the concept of 'harm reduction' was brought up, and even in the 7 minute segment, one of us even says that she is voting for Biden. I would like to inform listeners that the voting question was asked in the context of BOTH the primary today AND the general election. We talked about how messaging was a major issue that seemed to be lacking- and we certainly weren't looking for perfection (I heard everyone out individually after the interview).**  


*""Spoiler alert: young people don’t vote now because young people have never voted. During the turn of the century, liberals were high-fiving each other because they mobilized college campuses into mass voter registration. Tens of millions of people had gotten registered to vote for the first time. Then in November they didn’t vote.""*  
\-**I have voted in every election possible since 2020.**  


*""Do they know that four years ago abortion was a human right, and now it's illegal in several states?""*  
\-**Virtually everyone brought up women's rights during the interview and that is even present in the segment. Michigan is not at imminent risk of having abortion taken away after the referendum in the previous election.**  


*""I turned the radio off during this absurd segment. I don’t understand the never ending coverage of uninformed people who are unaware of how government actually works and the many things being done every day to improve people’s lives.""*   
\-**Multiple of us have or currently work for the government and we all come from a class that talks about current global issues philosophically.**  
""*These kids are having their brains melted by TikTok and media personalities.""*   
**-About half of us don't have Tiktok accounts, and one of us ""kids"" is in her 30s.**  


I personally made a lot of comments during the interview about how messaging on the Democrats' part is abysmal, and that Democrats not only let Republicans take control of the narrative, but they often fail to even take the opposite (oftentimes more popular) stance. Others at the table vehemently agreed. I brought up easy victories such as Federal decriminalization of Marijuana as a national security issue. We felt like bringing out Kamala Harris and Obama to Michigan at the last minute felt quite disingenuous and fake. Lastly, I find the narrative of us being young naive voters who expect everything to be solved right away ironic. Many Reddit commenters expressed that democracy would be ruined if we allowed Trump to have one more term. Just as how things don't magically get fixed in a term, things don't get ruined in a term (We're still here after Trump's first term, aren't we?). Even the oldest among us have not witnessed THAT many presidential elections within our lives, given that they happen every four years. The slavery debate took entire decades to resolve, and ultimately democracy takes time to affect change. We were ultimately hopeful that we could affect change on a local scale, and focused on the little victories.

Both sides of Congress have done it.\n\nBut someone point to me any previous President in the last 4 decades let alone a century who:\n\n* Called various state officials and tried to coerce them into “finding ballots”. There’s literally explicit phone calls where Trump is recorded verbatim trying to threaten officials to find ballots for him\n* Incited a riot that broke into the Capitol, threatened to hang the VP and Speaker, and rioters attacked many Capitol police and killed several of them.\n* Conspired with his own lawyers and sycophants to file bogus lawsuits and threaten election workers across various states.\n\nThere are plenty of 1st hand witnesses who have testified in depositions to Trump’s involvement.

Trump showed Biden absolutely NONE of that courtesy and respect whatsoever in a democratic country where the PEACEFUL transfer of power is expected and is the norm.\n\nWhatever your politics are, Trump has proved to the American people that he cannot be trusted with the Presidency ever again. ANYONE who engages in insurrection should not be allowed to hold political office, particular this Presidency. We cannot trust that Trump would only stay for just another term, he has given ZERO reason for us to suspect he would willingly leave after a 2nd term.

Let's find the middle on Abortion,"In light of a recent ruling deeming [embryos children](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240226-what-is-an-embryo-global-medical-definition-of-personhood-ivf-ruling), it feels like we've found ourselves at an extreme position. There really is only one direction to go and find the middle.

On one hand we have the rights of women and the sovereignty of their bodies while also protecting the rights of an unborn fetus. 

There is more to this controversial topic than the simple facts that apply to everyone when you sprinkle in arguments about religion or personal beliefs. I would hope to leave out religion and personal beliefs when it comes to a topic involving people of all religions and beliefs. At some point imposing those beliefs on others is just a dead end. 

If we are to take what we know about this topic, all leads point to medicine and doctors. These are the specialists and extra points if referencing OBGYN materials since they will have the most knowledge in this area. 

Besides the most egregious circumstances like those that threaten the life of the mother or a victim of sexual assault, what would be a safe cutoff for abortion? Keeping in mind the fetus is viable at roughly [24 weeks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability) I'm not religious and would probably be considered liberal but also feel 24 weeks is probably the opposite extreme to the Alabama ruling. 6 months pregnant is pretty far along and I would hope that the pregnancy could be discovered far before that point. 

It would be important that the woman has time to figure out if she is pregnant which makes 6 weeks just too close. I also want to respect the fact that women should have autonomy over their bodies while also recognizing that there is a line. Where is that line? And should it be made national legislation to prevent individual states from concocting dangerous circumstances for the fetus, the mother and all parties involved including medical staff? I've read about states attempting to pass travel bans preventing pregnant mothers from going to a more flexible state for their procedure.

Genuine question: Why is the GOP so dominant in Utah?,"So I was talking about this with a friend recently. He's a die-hard Trump supporter, and I support Biden. Utah is pretty divisive, like my friend and I. In 2020, Trump won Utah with 58% of the vote, but losing the SLC County vote at 43%. This is genuinely confusing to me, because my friend and I, along with most of the country have the exact same concerns. We have totally civil conversations, but every time he mentions something as a point of why he supports the GOP, it seems to be incorrect. For example, he's mentioned that Trump would be better than Biden for the National Debt. However, Trump added almost $8 trillion in four years, while Biden has only added $2.5 trillion. This was a crisis for the Trump administration even before Covid became a factor.

I was also told that Trump would be better for the Southern Boarder. However, after being in office and doing nothing for four years, combined with currently actively fighting any legislation that would address the boarder makes it clear to me that Trump doesn't actually care about the boarder.

If abortion is the factor, then why is it illegal? Data clearly shows that if abortions are legal, the overall number of actual abortions decline, along with mortality rates. I'm not a fan of abortions, but even the LDS church has the official stance that they are appropriate in certain situations. So why, if the dominant religion says it's acceptable, and if it actually decreases cases, is it such a hot topic?

If we support the military, the Dems passed a bill for the expansion of VA benefits for vets, despite GOP overwhelmingly fighting it. Same with the attempt to pass a gasoline price gouging bill, which was DOA thanks to the GOP fighting it. Remember the baby formula shortage? Same, GOP fought increasing production. Things like the Chips and Science act and Infrastructure act are some of the most important pieces of legislation in my lifetime, but the GOP seems to dismiss this as anything at all.

Taxes weren't lowered under Trump unless you were a corporation, our allies abroad are anticipating being totally abandoned by the US and the protection it offers, human rights are being violated, with hate speech talking about the poisoning of our national blood (straight from Hitler's speeches)...

I just don't get what the appeal is. Every point I've seen for supporting the GOP is valid, but with a little digging it seems that the dem's are the one trying to fix, while the GOP is trying to fight those things. And on top of that, Christians seem to feel a moral obligation to follow the GOP, despite the fact that the New Testament and Christ's teaching all indicate that the dem's are more in line with his teachings of love, acceptance, embracing and sheltering foreigners (Christ himself was a refugee in Egypt), feeding the poor (for free), healing the sick (for free), and not judging others and condemning them if their lives are on a different course than our own. Liars and hypocrites are described as some of the worst in society. So why is Trump, a man that has been found guilty in a court of law to be a liar, thief, conman, and rapist, the moral choice?

Surgical Abortion Experience: 12w,"I had a surgical abortion or dnc today. This was not by choice per se but I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum last week (hormone levels reflecting 12 weeks, gestational sack at 6 weeks). I started bleeding Sunday but the sack was not budging so I opted for a dnc at my hospital. The experience was of course not great but the staff was amazing and comforting. I was in no pain at all. The only somewhat scary incident was getting labs and the iv inserted. I was put under with twilight anesthesia and don’t remember a thing except waking up in the waiting room where I was given snacks and my fiancé joined me. I am now bleeding and cramping but nothing horrible. I’d recommend getting the surgical procedure if you choose as an option. I was told miso was not an option due to my levels and just the overall complexity of my blighted ovum. I am not happy about this experience but relieved I had the choice to do this. It was pain free (aside from iv insertion) and I think this will help make my recovery all the more bearable (emotionally). Honestly I think my fiancé was more traumatized than me as he hates hospitals. I was in and out in 4 hours and also took tomorrow off of work to recover.

why both sides of the abortion debate should oppose fat feminism,"[did an abortion ban cost a young texas woman her life?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/01/15/abortion-high-risk-pregnancy-yeni-glick) asks the pro-abortion new yorker magazine. for some reason, abortion advocates are trying to blame the young woman's death on texas's laws protecting life. there is no evidence she even wanted an abortion, let alone that she was denied one. texas's laws protecting life have generous exceptions for the health of the mother, so there's no doubt she would've been able to get one had she requested it given her condition.

the new yorker's agenda to sway public opinion against laws protecting life is quite obvious. but if the new yorker were a serious publication, it would have instead written about the dangers of obesity, which caused all of the complications the woman had during her pregnancy. in fact, an honest publication would've went even further and sharply criticized the fat feminism movement, not the pro-life movement. the former are promoting an ideology of death and morbidity, while the latter are promoting equal protections for all human beings.

in several first world nations currently falling into decadence, there have been pitiful pushes by numerous fat feminists to normalize and even glorify obesity under the guise of ""body positivity."" they have charged public health officials who are trying to combat obesity as being ""fat phobic."" the negative health effects on overweight and obese people are [numerous](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/health-effects/) and [well-documented](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html), and the [costs to society are immense](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/economic/).

the negative effects of obesity of course branch out to the abortion debate as well. for example, [according to the abortion industry](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2018/about-half-us-abortion-patients-report-using-contraception-month-they-became), over half of the abortions were caused by contraception failure. [multiple studies on emergency contraception](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/well/family/plan-b-weight-limit.html) have indicated that the drugs' efficacy is reduced if the woman taking them is overweight. thus, for one of the most marketed emergency contraception drug to actually be effective, the woman taking it has to be under a certain weight limit. given the exceptionally large rate of contraception failure, emergency contraception is more important than ever. if that fails as well, then we have even more unintended pregnancies.

more importantly, [obesity is linked to higher rates of miscarriages](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/19/7/1644/2356447), [various health complications during pregnancy](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/obesity-and-pregnancy) (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and preeclampsia), many of which lead to [increased maternal mortality](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-020-00691-4), and [infertility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456969/). obesity is in fact one of the leading causes of maternal mortality.  just think of how many miscarriages, dangerous health complications, for both the mom and the baby, and the various costs associated with them could have been avoided had the women simply gone on weight loss regiments.

i hope that by bringing these serious implications to light, both sides of the abortion debate are encouraged to combat the dangerous fat feminism movement.

Sentience,"Warning: wall of text.

**TL;DR:** *The ""capacity for sentience"" is a better metric to use to judge whether or not we should extend moral consideration to an organism than appealing to something like DNA. The pro-life side needs to defend why it's acceptable to grant legal protections to a zygote, because appealing to the ""humanness"" of the zygote is an impotent moral framework.*

Alabama recently ruled that frozen embryos are ""children"" legally. While they are [backtracking now](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/23/us/alabama-ivf-embryos-supreme-court-ruling-legislation/index.html) that they have faced political backlash, their view that human moral value begins at conception demands that any IVF procedure that ends with destroyed embryos be banned. This is completely logically consistent with a view that embryos are children. So is the banning of specific forms of contraception; if you believe that an embryo demands protection, then it is totally logically consistent to want to ban any birth control option that allows for fertilization but not implantation.

Therefore, ***this*** is the argument that needs addressing: that an egg upon fertilization is no different in a moral sense than a born human. 

I want to be clear up front: I am NOT making claims about the “humanity” of a fetus. I 100% accept that not only is a fertilized egg ""biologically human"", but it’s also a distinct human “organism”. 

I just don’t think that killing “a unique human organism” is always murder. This claim always creates either disgust or fear in PLers; generally, they'll suggest that admitting this is equivalent to admitting that I think murdering 5-year-olds is acceptable. However, the arguments I present here will make that strawman completely indefensible. I will tell PLers up front: every person you care about that you worry this moral system will exclude, whether they be disabled or comatose, is accounted for. 

Before I begin, I want to define my terms:

* **Personhood**: ""Personhood"" is a nebulous term bundles a lot of traits and qualities under a single umbrella, such as [sentience, emotionality, the ability to reason, self-awareness, and the ability to exercise moral agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anne_Warren#Criteria_of_personhood).
* **Moral consideration**: Moral consideration is the granting of a creature with minimum basic respect for its life and well-being and granting it certain protections. For example, you should not take action to harm this being unless you have a good reason to do so, and ultimately you should extend respect for its well-being whenever possible.
* **Capacity for sentience:** The capacity for sentience is the capacity for a brain to perceive or feel; possessing the necessary structures to have a subjective experience as a unique individual ([qualia](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/)). The *capacity* for sentience is different than currently *being* sentient; one does not need to have an unbroken continuity of experience to have the capacity for sentience, in the same way that a computer does not need a continuity of being ""on"" to have the capacity to be turned on. Comas, sleeping, and other forms of temporary sedation or suspension of faculties therefore do not remove someone from having the capacity for sentience anymore than handcuffing someone removes the capacity for their arms to work.

While in general I do believe that ""personhood"" as a set of traits is what defines our incredible moral worth as humans, my threshold for extending moral consideration to something does not require it to have all of the traits of ""personhood"" I've listed. Those that cannot exercise moral agency or reason are still valuable after all, so the loss of a trait or even multiple does not remove a creature from being worthy of considering its well-being. 

So for the purposes of discussing fetal value, I'll set a low bar for moral value: the capacity for sentience only. If a creature possesses this trait, it at minimum is worthy of moral consideration.

With that out of the way, let's start with arguments I do not agree with:

**Argument from Humanity (Human DNA)**

The argument from humanity is an argument in which a being is granted moral consideration because of its humanity; if a thing is a distinct human organism, it is as valuable as any other human organism, regardless of life stage or ""completeness"". This seems to be the most common pro-life arguments for fetal moral consideration, and I wholly reject it as a model of morality, as it is both too exclusive and too inclusive.

The argument from humanity is too **exclusive** because it assigns a biological essentialism to morality that no one actually adheres to. We do not currently grant life moral consideration because of its DNA, nor should we. For example, many of us love our pets. However, in a PL view why should we value them? The argument from humanity only grants value to humans. A profiler COULD argue that much like a human, a pet should be treated with moral consideration because that species has the same self-referential value that humans have. The problem with this is that all I could ever offer as an explanation as to why I should value a dog from a PL perspective is ""because they are a living dog"". How does that offer me any criteria by which to think about moral value, or to try and include say... a cat? By what criteria would I decide to morally value a cat if the only reason I can give for valuing my pet dog is by appealing to its ""dogness""? The PL view of moral worth strikes me as simply stating part of a *definition* of what an organism is while not offering any *explanation* as to why that organism is worth moral consideration or when they stop being worth moral consideration. It's defining humans as valuable because they're valuable. This lack of an explanation is completely impotent when trying to talk about any other creature as well. If we meet intelligent aliens, make AI, or genetically engineer a new organism to be capable of conscious thought, feelings, and communication, does their lack of human DNA exclude them from moral consideration? Of course not! Yet the PL moral model would be incapable of extending moral consideration to these creatures without admitting that moral worth comes from sentience.

The argument is also too **inclusive** because it can't reasonably exclude those that are obviously not ""persons"" anymore without incredible feats of mental gymnastics. For example, consider a brain-dead body of a man named ""John"". This man is dead. By any definition of dead, John is dead. We owe very little morally to the bones of a dead person, and any moral consideration we grant to corpses is residual respect given to the person that *previously* inhabited the body, but not respect for corpses as things of value in themselves. John's heart might still beat, his lungs may still work, and his liver may still function, but he has lost all capacity for sentience. He neither is currently sentient, nor is his brain capable of generating sentience. He can be *biologically* alive in the sense that his organs are functioning, but the parts of him that made him a **person** that desired, felt, thought, and acted are all gone. ""John"" as an entity is dead. As dead as a corpse being lowered into the ground. The fact that his organs are alive make no difference; the *person* we call ""John"" no longer exists, because all the things that made John a person have been irrevocably destroyed.

This is an example of a biologically alive ""human"" that no longer has moral consideration. While I would treat the body of John with as much respect as any other body, I can no longer really transgress against John. I cannot hurt his feelings or harm him, because there is no longer a ""John"" to experience or care about that. He is a corpse with a beating heart. The way I see it, John is dead in all the ways that matter. He is not a person. Similarly, I think of a fetus as not being a person based on the same criteria I hold for John. There's no feeling, no thoughts, no desires... *nothing* happening that could possibly differentiate the ""sentience"" of a fetus from the ""sentience"" of John.

**Argument From Future Potential**

The argument that inevitably follows the ""brain death"" analogy is one of future potential. The argument tends to be that sure, ""John"" may not be a person anymore, but John's brain is **dead** while the fetus is **developing**. The problem is that I think this requires an admission of the validity of my argument: sure, this creature currently is not in a state where we should grant it moral consideration, but it **will** be. This is an admission that the fetus does not currently possess the capacity for sentience and trying to pass off ""potential"" as the same thing. I can't agree with that potential value is exchangeable with current value.

**Argument from Relationships**

This one is actually an argument I see from my own side, funnily enough (so none of you get to pretend I don’t critique my own side!). I don’t think that relationships dictate (or really even are relevant to) whether or not I should extend moral consideration to something. If you’re an orphan with no friends, I don’t think that means I get to retract moral consideration and consider myself an empathetic or caring person. In fact, I’d suggest that my doing so proves I am NOT caring and empathetic.

**Rejecting** **Value as a Hierarchy**

Inevitably when I lay talk about my views on moral consideration, someone asks if an animal has “less moral value” than a person. I always found this question hard to answer because it's not even what I'm arguing. 

“Moral consideration” is a threshold; either a creature has traits that make me think I should treat it with basic respects, or it doesn’t. Something that has “less value” is a thing that exists in a hierarchy within which things can be ranked. I don’t argue that moral consideration should be hierarchical.

For example, I think dogs, pigs, and humans are all easily worthy of moral consideration. However, questions of a hierarchy of value are not relevant to this post and not part of my argument. Either a creature meets the criteria or it does not. 

**Argument for the Capacity for Sentience as the Determinant of Moral Determination**

Now that I've laid out the arguments I've rejected, I'll briefly talk about why I think sentience is the better option. What’s valuable about sentience? Well, it's hard to argue for an axiomatic value, but simply put: a sentient creature is the only thing capable of caring about anything. It's the only thing capable of *feeling* anything, experiencing something as good or bad, and so it's the only thing to which having a ""moral duty"" even makes sense. It is only a mind that has the capacity for sentience that can be robbed of anything; I do not “rob” a rock of experience if I were to crush it. I cannot transgress against a corpse. I cannot hurt a plant's feelings or cause pain to a creature with no nervous system. In effect, I can cause a harm a creature in a morally relevant way only if it is capable of perceiving that harm subjectively. 

When it comes to measuring the capacity for sentience, we actually have developed sophisticated understandings of the brain during events [like a vegetative state](https://mindmatters.ai/2020/04/can-loved-ones-in-a-coma-hear-us/) and how that differs from brain death, as well as [how the human brain develops](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989000/). It's possible that in the future we'll learn something that we don't currently know, but as it stands it seems like the capacity for sentience isn't really possible before 20+ weeks. This means that, to my understanding, almost all abortions are performed on fetuses that cannot subjectively feel, perceive, think, reason, etc.

**Conclusion**

So, we know what sentience looks like, both in engaging with a creature and in terms of brain activity, we know approximately when the capacity develops in humans, and we can tell the difference between a body that is comatose and one that is brain dead. The moral framework of thinking about moral consideration in the framework of sentience also has the advantage of allowing us to reflect on why we value others and most importantly. It allows us APPLY those values to others based on those values in a way that frameworks like the Argument from DNA are incapable of doing.

For these reasons I think arguing for the capacity for sentience as the metric by which we extend moral consideration is the better option.

I'd go a step farther and suggest that if any PLer wants to argue that DNA makes a person worthy of that moral consideration, they need to *defend that point rather than assuming it*. Calling PCers murderers and people that just want to kill babies is totally unimpressive if the best defense you can muster in response to a PCer challenging your moral framework is ""it's a human being!!!""",1b1pg7v,12,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebatingAbortionBans/comments/1b1pg7v/sentience/,"['This was a fascinating post and raised a number of questions which I hadn\'t considered myself.\n\nTrue to form, I would like to work this through by making a hypothetical which tests a few of these elements.\n\nLet\'s consider a future anti-aging technology which allows an adult to revert to their original zygote, be gestated within an artificial womb, and emerge as a child again. I sign up to undergo this process and get placed into the gestation device. Assuming this is successful and I am ""reborn"", is there any point during this process where I ceased being myself? For PL it seems clear that I was always the same person, and my temporary interlude as a zygote had no impact on my rights. If we follow your logic we might say the person who emerged from the device is a different person, but why should that be true? There is an unbroken continuity of my life. The only material difference is the number of cells my body is constituted from.\n\nPerhaps we could make this even more interesting by tweaking the hypothetical slightly. Let\'s assume in a parallel universe a person destroys my zygote form before I can be successfully gestated from the artificial womb. It seems clear this is morally wrong, and is equivalent to killing my adult form, but why is that true?\n\nI think the answer may be that a zygote is greater than the sum of its parts. Separately, each element may not reach this threshold, but when taken together we end up with an individual which is worthy of protection.\n\nIt seems the most important aspect is the potential for my zygote form to become the person I was before undergoing this procedure. This potential is easier to visualize because I was an adult before turning back to a zygote, but either way we are valuing my future potential to determine what protections should be afforded in the present.\n\nSecondly, we know in advance my prior adult form wanted this process to be successful. On that basis, it is wrong for the person who destroyed my artificial womb to deny my existence. It\'s hard to determine exactly what is given moral consideration here, but I think it is similar to potential. We might say it is protecting my right not to be unjustly killed. It seems deeply unfair to destroy my zygote without a good reason when we know my prior adult form wanted this to continue. This might be an example of valuing potential moral agency.\n\nOverall, I think a combination of those aspects lead PL to believe a zygote is deserving of protection, even without sentience, and is entitled not to be unjustly killed, but is not entitled to be born (there is a difference I promise...).', 'Thanks for this post, hope this can foster productive discussion with our PL (or PC) users who disagree.', 'Good argument, as always. And I agree that sentience is way more important than DNA. \n\nAs for moral consideration being extended …. What does that even mean when it comes to a fertilized egg? It has a natural lifespan of 6–14 days. How would we show moral consideration? It can’t eat, can’t breathe, doesn’t need diapers or care, and, as you said, has no sentience, so it can’t feel or experience anything. \n\nSo what can be done to it tor for it o show moral consideration? \n\nAnd what does „destruction“ look like? Pounding it with a meat tenderizer? Throwing it in the incinerator? Just letting them thaw out or dropping them on the floor won’t destroy them, unless a shard of glass cut them up. \n\nThey’ll still live out the remainder of their natural lifespan - unless other steps are taken to actually destroy them. \n\nTo me, what PL refers to as destruction means not extending a human‘s natural lifespan. Whether that be by freezing or via another human‘s organs, organ functions, tissue, blood, or blood contents, or via  hooking them up to life support. \n\nI fail to see how such is destruction or killing - rather than not extending their natural lifespan. \n\nI also don’t see how, by their logic, failed implantation wouldn’t be destruction. No one expanded their lifespan, and they ended up dead, after all. \n\nHow does making an attempt to save change things from destruction to not destruction? \n\nIf I make no attempt to perform CPR or revive, or stop such attempts, have I killed or destroyed anyone? \n\nWhile the argument for sentience is sound, I can’t make it past the first hurdles of not saving or not extending natural lifespan equaling destruction or killing. And the idea that it’s even possible to grant moral consideration to a fertilized egg.']"

How to setup Spark mode to bypass third-party libraries,"So I wanted to play some with Ada/Spark, but ran into an issue where running `gnatprove` resulted in errors. I understand why the errors are being thrown, but admittedly don’t fully understand how to properly turn on/off `SPARK_Mode` for different packages, subprograms, etc.

Here’s what I did…

Create a new project using Alire:

    alr init --bin spark_playground && cd spark_playground

Create files `square.ads` and `square.adb` with the following code.

    -- square.ads
    package Square with
     SPARK_Mode => On
    is
      type Int_8 is range -2**7 .. 2**7 - 1;
      type Int_8_Array is array (Integer range <>) of Int_8;
    
      function Square (A : Int_8) return Int_8 is (A * A) with
       Post =>
        (if abs A in 0 | 1 then Square'Result = abs A else Square'Result > A);
    
      procedure Square (A : in out Int_8_Array) with
       Post => (for all I in A'Range => A (I) = A'Old (I) * A'Old (I));
    
    end Square;
    -- square.adb
    with Square; use Square;
    
    package body Square is
    
       procedure Square (A : in out Int_8_Array) is
       begin
          for V of A loop
             V := Square (V);
          end loop;
       end Square;
    
    end Square;

Update `spark_playground.adb` with the following code.

    with Square;      use Square;
    with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
    
    procedure Spark_Playground is
       V : Int_8_Array := (-2, -1, 0, 1, 10, 11);
    begin
       for E of V loop
          Put_Line (""Original: "" & Int_8'Image (E));
       end loop;
       New_Line;
    
       Square.Square (V);
       for E of V loop
          Put_Line (""Square:   "" & Int_8'Image (E));
       end loop;
    end Spark_Playground;

Build and run the project with

    alr build
    alr run

Run `gnatprove` with

    alr gnatprove

So far everything works as expected. Great!

However, when adding in `gnatcoll` by running

    alr with gnatcoll

And updating `spark_playground.adb` with

    with Square;        use Square;
    with Ada.Text_IO;   use Ada.Text_IO;
    with GNATCOLL.JSON; use GNATCOLL.JSON;
    
    procedure Spark_Playground is
       V        : Int_8_Array := (-2, -1, 0, 1, 10, 11);
       --  Create a JSON value from scratch
       My_Obj   : JSON_Value  := Create_Object;
       My_Array : JSON_Array  := Empty_Array;
    begin
       My_Obj.Set_Field (""field1"", Create (Integer (1)));
       My_Obj.Set_Field (""name"", ""theName"");
       for E of V loop
          Put_Line (""Original: "" & Int_8'Image (E));
       end loop;
       New_Line;
    
       Square.Square (V);
       for E of V loop
          Put_Line (""Square:   "" & Int_8'Image (E));
          Append (My_Array, Create (Integer (E)));
       end loop;
    
       My_Obj.Set_Field (""data"", My_Array);
    
       Put_Line (My_Obj.Write (False));
    end Spark_Playground;

`gnatprove` now fails with messages of the form, which make sense given the definitions of Name\_Abort and friends.

    gpr-err-scanner.adb:2421:15: error: choice given in case statement is not static
     2421 |         when Name_Abort =>
          |              ^~~~~~~~~~
    
    gpr-err-scanner.adb:2421:15: error: ""Name_Abort"" is not a static constant (RM 4.9(5))
     2421 |         when Name_Abort =>
          |              ^~~~~~~~~~
    
    #### lots more similar error messagess and then
    gnatprove: error during generation of Global contracts
    error: Command [""gnatprove"", ""-P"", ""spark_playground.gpr""] exited with code 1

I’d like to strategically disable SPARK\_Mode in the offending package or subprogram with either `SPARK_Mode => On` or `pragma SPARK_Mode (Off);` but can’t seem to figure out how to successfully do that. I’ve tried updating `grr-err.ads` (which I’d prefer not to modify since it's not my file) by adding a pragma for SPARK\_Mode.

       package Scanner is
          pragma SPARK_Mode (Off);
          type Language is (Ada, Project);
          --- rest of package def removed for space
    

Unfortunately, that didn’t work as expected. I also sprinkled variations of SPARK\_Mode “off” in other places like body definition, subprogram, etc., but no luck.

What’s the proper way to have `gnatprove` skip over specific code sections or packages, especially those in third-party libraries not under my control?

Thanks in advance for any assistance.",1b1p9m6,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ada/comments/1b1p9m6/how_to_setup_spark_mode_to_bypass_thirdparty/,[]

Something light and funny- pref paranormal/fantasy/sci-fi,"Something more light and funny (not cringey)

So I am really craving a book that is going to make me laugh- it doesn’t have to be full comedy just some amusing antics. I am also not big on second hand embarrassment cringe humour though that’s too over the top, I always have to skip cringey second hand embarrassment bits in books or tv lol.

I recently read The Female by Invi Wright (RH paranormal/fantasy trilogy) and I really enjoyed it and just found myself laughing quite a bit with the interactions of the characters and want something to scratch that itch.

Prefer fantasy/paranormal style books but open to contemporary (not in to Historical). Open to MF or RH (sword crossing ok lol)

Do not want anything with cheating or abortion please. Also if one of the MC’s is immortal then everyone has to end up it as well if that makes sense.

Plane aborts landing at Heathrow Airport due to strong winds,"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-68408516

I’ve heard of/seen aborted landings before, but this one was on the ground so long I’m amazed it had the momentum to take off again!

I know nothing about planes in case that isn’t obvious, but I do have a fear of flying and one of my fears is always that the plane I’m on hasn’t built up enough speed/momentum to take off effectively. Obviously that’s pretty irrational during a regular take-off, but I feel the concern here could be justified so I’m curious to hear from someone who actually knows. 

",1b1oeo5,0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1b1oeo5/plane_aborts_landing_at_heathrow_airport_due_to/,"['Inertia to fire up the engines and keep that momentum going is the safest option. \n\nYeah, it might have a wheel on the ground, but you’re asking a lot to slow it down enough for safe taxi off the runway.\n\nPilots have a split second to make a call. It is almost always safe to go-around and try again.', 'This is not news.\n\nI’m an airline pilot and I landed a 787 at Heathrow yesterday (same day this happened). The winds were gustier than hell and I definitely had to work to get it down, but that happens all the time. I can easily see how an aborted landing might have happened due to the weather yesterday, but go arounds are extremely routine, very common and not at all unsafe or newsworthy.', 'The pilots can safely choose to go around at any point until the thrust reverse are engaged.', ""It's rare to go around after touching down but it is a completely safe and valid manoeuvre. In this case you can see the aircraft was not on the runway well - main wheels down and nose wheel coming down in a controlled manner - so going around rather than wobbling all over the place and running out of runway (or off the side) was the right thing to do.\n\nJust after the aircraft touches the runway, it's moving at nearly the speed needed to fly off the runway. Significant braking only begins when the wing spoilers lift up, which reduces the lift from the wing and places more weight on the wheels. Once there's a lot of weight on the wheels, they can have significant braking force applied and slow the aircraft down.\n\nSo it's quite easy to touch down then increase thrust and take off again with plenty of runway left. It's something that pilots practice when learning to fly, because it practices the approach and landing without needing to take the time to stop, turn around, and takeoff again before you can do another practice landing. \n\nLarge transport aircraft can go around until the thrust reversers are deployed, and that is only several seconds after the main wheels touch down (on nearly every aircraft operating today, there are old exceptions that are different). The aircraft in this news report did not deploy reversers."", '>I know nothing about planes in case that isn’t obvious, but I do have a fear of flying and one of my fears is always that the plane I’m on hasn’t built up enough speed/momentum to take off effectively.

It's only for about 12 hours then it's a dull cramp for a day or two. You'll need the day off. Put a heating pad on your back and your lower belly.

It’s not painful, it’s more mild cramping than anything and the discomfort of knowing you’re bleeding so much in such a short amount of time. Definitely get at the very least a follow up ultrasound, if you live in a place where abortions are legal you should follow up with weekly/biweekly blood drawls to watch your recovery and ensure that it was successful. My MA was not successful, I was 5/6 weeks along and retained product of conception so I was in the ER for it. Ultimately it passed 9 weeks later on its own but I was going to need a d&c if it wouldn’t have passed with my period. I bled for 8 weeks straight with the actual MA and only 1 week with the missed miscarriage induction so two very different experiences with the same medication used for both. I received care from my OB for each scenario which kept my health in check especially after I discovered the retained product at the ER. Definitely get the super huge pads or even the adult diapers for the MA itself, lots of your favorite snacks & drinks to make it suck less.

She's pregnant,"""I'm pregnant and afraif

I’m pregnant and the other woman of 2 years

I was reading here through my main account, I made a new one, so no one can find my identity.  
Also, I'm not a native English speaker, and on my phone, so sorry if I make any grammar or formatting  errors. 

I am a 26yo woman, in a relationship with MM who’s 34, married for 14years to his wife (same age, HS sweethearts). 

We met through work, at first it was just innocent talking, but we found out that we have so much in common. Slowly we fell in love, and two years ago, our relationship turned physical.  
His home life is hard. Wife is a SAHM, their kids are 14 and 12yo girls. Sometimes he vents about her, but then he states that he can't leave her, cuz he is the breadwinner and the courts in this country give full custody to mothers and fathers to become weekend dads, while paying 50% of their income as support.  
We agreed to wait until the youngest turned 18, then became official (in this way, their mother can’t force the weekend dad role on him and can't claim his house) 

I was okay with it. We meet up 3-4 times a week in my apartment, we cook together, he fixes stuff that needs to be fixed. I'm a homebody, I don't care that we can't go on public dates.  
Everything was perfect.  
Today, I went to my yearly checkup, and I wanted to change my birth control implant (it should have been good for the next three months, but I wanted to be sure)  we'll, turned out, that I’m 10 weeks pregnant.  
I'm shocked. I didn't have any symptoms. Then I remembered a story here, where MM just ghosted OW after she got pregnant. I'm so afraid this is going to happen to me, but im sure I don't want an abortion (had one when I was a teen, and it was traumatic)  
I have to tell him, I know it's a must. 

But I need some encouragement and support.""

My siblings and I were destined to kill each other at the age of twenty two,"I wish I could tell you that being a witch is exactly how it's portrayed on TV. 

When I was a little girl, I watched Kiki’s Delivery Service for the first time, and I immediately turned to my mother and asked where my broomstick was. Kiki was my first awakening into my powers. I was seven years old when I sent a bowl of choco pops into my brother’s face without using my hands. 

I wasn't a witch like Kiki, though. My family had a coven, so magic naturally ran through our veins. I could move things with my mind, and *sometimes* levitate objects, if I tried really hard. 

My brother could generate light magic between his fingers, and with concentration, my sister could turn broccoli into ice-cream. This was the reality of being a young witch, a whole new playground to discover and figure out. The world felt almost tangible, like it was mine to contort between my fingers. 

Objects could fly, and animals could talk if I could find the right charm. 

When I started consuming witch media, I couldn't wait to receive my broomstick, and find my feline familiar. 

But that's not what being a witch is. 

I was ten years old when I discovered my siblings and I would not live past the age of twenty two, and Kiki’s Delivery Service was just a human’s fantasy of what I witch really was. 

I naively thought it was a natural half witch's death, and I was weirdly okay with it. I would rather die a witch than become a human. Thanks to my mother’s subtle brainwashing, I was fully against leaving my coven behind. 

However, no, that wasn't it. Witches with siblings do live past the age of twenty two. Only one can become a full witch. I was in denial, trying to convince myself that I would become human. My brother and sister weren't going to die, right? Where was *that* in my favorite movie?  

Mom broke it to me gently. 

The ritual is not a transfer of power.

It is a fight to the death, and then a sacrifice. 

Only one of us would obtain our family's magic, carving it from the other two, and taking it for themselves. 

According to our coven, magic cannot be evenly shared between siblings. 

Especially triplets.

Magic cannot be transferred. Witch’s have tried in the past, with the results killing subjects and ripping coven’s apart. In witch media, magic is tangible. It can be moulded and touched, appearing to the naked eye in colorful light. In the real world, magic is not a physical thing. We can generate light, but physical magic does not exist. 

It is entwined inside our souls, part of our beating heart, and can only be stolen, ripped from the soul of a dead witch. Magic must choose a dominating body and soul. For only children, they automatically become full witches when reaching adulthood, adopting their parent’s power. 

But for us, becoming a full witch is a brutal fight. 

Magic does not choose a soul. It is up to the siblings themselves to decide who gets it. 

In our case, it's different. 

We were born on the exact day, under the same moon, binding us to each other, our souls and magic entangling. 

All siblings are given a deadline. If magic does *not* find a dominating body on their twenty second birthday, the magic returns to the parent, and the siblings become what is called Empty. 

Empty is neither human nor witch, a vacant shell drained of personality and thought. Empty’s can be twisted and contorted by what is called velvet magic, and be turned into soldiers, so they are put down before their bodies can be used. 

So, yeah. 

Either betray and murder my siblings, or become a mindless shell. 

When my mother was pregnant with us, she was advised to abort us. Twins and triplets are rare among our coven, but when they are born, their fate’s are already sealed to end in a bloodbath. 

With our magic split three ways, our lives were ticking time bombs. I would rather have been aborted in the womb than be granted twenty two years of life, only to have it ripped from me by my own blood. Mom, however, saw us less like her children, more akin to bull’s in a ring. 

Mom has always been intense, obsessed with her family's power, and her place by our grandmother, the head of the Montgomery coven’s side. She wanted to see us fight for her magic, and for our right to stand as the surviving Montgomery witch. Mom wanted a bloodbath. She never saw me as a daughter. Instead, I was a tribute. 

As children, our bedtime story was her own ritual as an eighteen year old. 

Mom had two brothers. I don't know their names, she never talked about them like they were her siblings. Instead, she treated them more like contestants. 

Who she beat. 

I know the story so well, each detail ingrained inside my skull. I know exactly how she murdered them in perfect detail, revelling in their power and becoming a full witch. 

Unlike us, she wasn't a triplet or a twin. Her ritual wasn't taken as seriously as ours would be, so she could kill them and take their magic at any point. 

She killed one brother at his job, ripping his heart out, and the other brother at home, slicing his throat. 

Mom described it like it was a euphoric experience, that absorbing the power from her brother’s dying corpse filled her with pleasure. Mom told us it was either her or them, but I couldn't take her seriously when her lips pricked into a smile, like just reminiscing about killing her siblings filled her with that phantom power she tore from them. It’s not like we were quiet about the ritual. 

When we discovered what would happen to us, I thought it was a joke. 

I mean, I heard rumors about the blood witch's barbaric rituals, but they were like myths, scary stories to frighten young witches. Blood witches intentionally hurt humans for their own enjoyment. The Carlisle coven are a well known story. I used to have nightmares about them when I was a kid. 

Mom made it clear that because we were triplets, and the stakes were higher, our ritual would be treated like a ceremony, held on our twenty second birthday. 

My brother locked himself in his room for three days, and I made it clear I wouldn't be taking part. I tried to run away when I was fourteen. 

I say *tried*, because I got as far as west Virginia, searching for our human father. He ran away when Mom revealed his three children wouldn't live past the age of twenty two. After some digging around, I found his name. 

Samuel Lockhart. 

He was human, and a professor, according to social media. He didn't have a profile picture. Well, he did, but it was a robin on a snowy branch. It looked like he was a photographer, but I couldn't see any of his profile. What I did have was half of a physical photo. 

Mom tore it apart, so dad’s face was gone. Still, I could see the location, a towering brick building which could only be the college he worked at. 

I planned on starting there. When we were kids, Mom had forbidden us to talk about dad, calling him a coward for running away from his own children. 

Dad just had common sense. 

He was a human who didn't understand the witch world, and I don't think he could deal with bringing up children who were destined to die. I got as far as the train station in Dad’s hometown, oblivious that I was already being tracked down. 

Mom forced my brother to cast a teleportation spell, which she knew would drain him, and because our souls and powers are entwined, it would drain me too. The only thing that does not affect us as a three is magic itself. 

If I were to paralyse my sister (I have in the past, when she's repeatedly stolen my clothes) neither me, nor our brother would be affected. However, if my brother was to cast a spell garnering colossal amounts of power, such as teleportation or soul transference, all three of us would be physically affected. 

We share things like tiredness and sickness. If they're sick, so am I. If my sister was coughing her guts up with the flu, or staying up all night to watch a new Netflix series, then all three of us paid the consequences. We shared each other's pain. When we were younger, of course we took advantage. 

If the other two were annoying me, I pinched myself. 

When Callie fell off of her bike, Eli and I *felt* the sting of her cut, and the gravel stuck to her hand. I broke my leg falling out a tree when I was seven, and all of us ended up in the hospital. It was my leg that was broken, but Callie and Eli could feel the electroshocks running up and down my knee. I had the stomach flu, and they felt the crippling nausea in my gut, but never actually barfed.

Mom was smart.

She didn't have to send our coven after me, because she already had her secret weapons. 

Eli and Callie. 

I made it halfway across the train station, before my brain filled with fog, my arms dropping to my sides. My bag slipped off of my shoulder, and before I knew what was happening, I was on my knees, my eyes heavy, exhaustion slamming into me like tumultuous waves. I could feel him. 

Eli. 

His thoughts were fuzzy and distant, dancing across the back of my mind. 

*Run*. 

His voice was barely a whisper creeping into my skull. 

I couldn't run. I couldn't even move, my body filled with lead. Which meant he had cast a spell powerful enough to drain all three of us. I was aware of people asking if I was okay, but my mouth wouldn't work, every thought going supernova. I forgot why I was there, why I was running in the first place. 

I could sense Eli’s agony, and Callie’s brewing panic attack. Mom was arming both of them against me. There were images in my head, flickers of past rituals I was forced to watch on Mom’s laptop. 

I could see chunks of flesh, pooling red splattered across a battleground that was either an average suburban home, or these witches had held their ritual in the middle of the forest, away from prying human eyes. 

I could still see it. 

What made me run away. 

The surviving sibling, a young girl, standing with her sister’s severed head swinging from her grasp. Her smile was grotesque, a grin so evil, so twisted, I refused to believe she was part of our coven. The girl was painted, stained in the blood of her sister, and yet I couldn't see remorse or pain in her eyes, a flicker of regret or disgust. 

I only saw triumph, her gaze burning bright, emanating the power she ripped from her sibling. I didn't want to become that. 

Burying my head in my arms, I didn't even have the energy to sob. 

I was curled up on the train station platform when my mother found me. 

I was shivering, my eyes half lidded. 

There were two pairs of shoes in front of me. 

Mom, and Eli. 

When I forced my eyes fully open, my brother loomed over me, hiding under dark brown curls as if in shame. I could still see the slight glow in his eyes from the spell, magic like stardust polluting his iris. Magic was supposed to be beautiful, but in my brother’s eyes, it resembled a force taking over him. 

His cheeks were ashy, eyes flickering open and closed, like he wasn't sure where he was. Eli shared my foggy brain and whirlwind thoughts, a gnawing, painful urge to just drop. He was swaying side to side, like he would give in at any moment, release himself to the oblivion creeping inside his soul. 

Mom’s fingers were wrapped around his arm to prevent him from collapsing too. 

I already had an audience, and she waved them away with forced reassurances. 

“Please excuse my daughter, she's a chronic narcoleptic,” Mom laughed, scooping me into her arms. She treated the two of us to chocolate milkshakes on the way home. I thought it was an apology, but one look from my brother, idly slurping on his straw, told me she was just filling us with sugar to prevent us passing out. Mom was too warm. When she carried me out of the car, my Mom felt and smelled like home. 

Like my pillows, and our kitchen.

The flowers she decorates the walls with. 

Home. 

Ironic, because home stopped feeling like *home* after my attempt to run away. 

The Montgomery coven cast a binding spell which imprisoned us inside the house. I remember it felt like being ripped apart, like cold, heavy shackles tangled around my soul, biting into every nerve ending. The front door was now a luxury. 

If we wanted to go into the yard, we had to earn it. The only trips we made were with the coven, and I felt like a freak show, forced under a cloak, hidden from the outside world.

*The Montgomery triplets*, I heard a human kid say, when we strode past them on their bikes. 

“I bet they're witches.”

They started laughing, and I felt Eli’s frustration. 

I felt the sting of his fingernails carving half moons into the flesh of his palms.

I don't think my brother *meant* to send the kid flying off of his handlebars. He didn't even say the spell right, muttering it under his hood. 

After that incident, we weren't even allowed outside to see the coven. 

Mom homeschooled us, insisting that the human world was dangerous to a half witch. A small cult of humans who are aware of our existence, abduct half witches and use them for their own personal gain. That is true. 

Half witch abductions are fairly common. Still though, Mom was using our fear of humans as an excuse to keep us from running away. It's not like we could, with the binding spell in place, but she was wary of the human world influencing us away from the coven. 

I don't want to call it brainwashing, but from the age of fourteen, we barely left the house, separated from our human and half witch friends. From the age of sixteen, Mom started teaching us individually. My classes were on Monday night after dinner, while Eli and Callie’s were on weekends. It was obvious what Mom was trying to do. She was already stitching the seed into our minds that our siblings were not to be trusted. That we were secretly conspiring against each other to take the Montgomery magic for ourselves. 

I admit, I did work at first. I was naive, oblivious of the coven’s subtle mental warfare. When you're constantly enclosed with the same people, distrust fogs the air, twisting logic and bleeding into the back of your mind, planting seeds that were already there, but now they're bigger, leeching onto your thoughts. 

I became convinced Eli was secretly planning to kill me early, when he stopped talking to me, only communicating in one word answers. 

“Are you okay?” I made the two of us coffee, and he poured his down the drain. 

“Yeah.” Eli wouldn't look me in the eye. 

“What's going on?” 

“Nothing.”

“Eli, talk to me.” 

He shrugged, ducking his head. “No.”

I started to lock my door at night, growing fearful of his eyes meeting mine, knowing one spell uttered from his lips would and could kill me. I was suddenly far too aware of the silverware on his plate at dinner, his Xbox controller when he was waving it around too much. I saw them as objects. 

Mom forbade magic being used outside of our individual classes, so he could kill me with his bare hands. I became paranoid, suffocated with thoughts of Callie and Eli choking me in my sleep, or slicing my throat with a kitchen knife. 

We were seventeen years old when I became awake and aware of what our coven were doing. I almost killed my sister. After being driven mad by thoughts of my own demise at the hands of my siblings, I became withdrawn, obsessed with their every movement. 

I sat in my bedroom and stared at four walls, hyper focused on my brother’s footsteps in his room, and the exact weight my sister put into her stride down the stairs. I didn't shower or eat. 

I planned, staying up all night to devise the perfect murder (s). 

I studied my siblings’ every move, finding weak spots and the best place and time to strike. With my sister, it had to be heart removal. Callie was a heavy sleeper, and I was sure, if I kept quiet, I could sneak into her room and kill her before she could kill me. Eli was different. 

According to Mom, he was the weakest, magic wise. But he towered over the two of us. I settled on slicing his throat. 

It would be quick and easy, and painless.

Mostly painless. 

What I didn't know was that my siblings had the exact same thought. 

I was so obsessed with winning, with surviving, I had no idea the feelings I felt, that paranoia tearing me apart, that thirst to kill, was drowning them too. 
 
*Kill.*

*Before they kill me.*

The night I planned to rip out my sister’s heart, my brother was already hiding behind the door, a steak knife pressed to his chest. But Callie was waiting for us, her own knife clenched between her trembling fingers under the blankets. 

Eli struck first with magic he wasn't allowed to use. 

It was a stun spell, sending me staggering back. I hit the ground, my vision foggy. Eli was already straddling Callie, teasing the blade into her throat, his teeth gritted. 

I saw red, throwing myself onto his back, wrenching at his hair, my own knife grazing his Adam’s apple. I had to win. That thought was choking our minds, drowning us. Winning was surviving. 

That's what Mom drilled into us. 

Grappling with our sister, Eli twisted around, already mumbling a spell he only knew half of, which turned my nose purple. It was so sudden, so ludicrous, for a disorienting moment, we stopped screaming and yelling at each other. 

Seconds passed. Then a full minute. I was gasping for breath, blinking thorough tunnel vision, when my brother burst out laughing. The knife slipped from his fingers, and he flopped onto the bed, laughing into a pillow. Actually laughing, the kind of laughter that vibrated his whole body. I was caught off guard. Mom told me to strike first when they were least expecting us. 

I tried to, but the knife suddenly felt stupid in my hand, like a child's toy. 

That same hysteria slammed into me, and this time it was lukewarm waves pulling me down, enveloping my body. 

Dropping onto my knees, I was overcome with exhaustion, which quickly became almost drunk giggles I couldn't control. Callie relaxed, tipping her head back, eyes flickering shut. 

“Mom.” she whispered. 

Eli rolled onto his back, and after standing there hesitantly, I joined the two of them, squashing myself between them. Callie’s bed was warm. I forgot what my bed felt like. I had been sleeping on the floor for months, terrified of being murdered in my sleep. 

I felt at peace, finally, enough to close my eyes and sleep for the first time in what felt like forever. 

With my brain filled with cotton candy, I dizzily counted the stars on Callie’s ceiling. 

When we were younger, Eli promised us that he would paint the whole room with the galaxy one day, as soon as he got his full powers. Little Eli had no idea what those full powers enquired. 

“Mom is fucking with us,” he mumbled, cutting into my thoughts. 

He was still kind of giddy, so it was more of a sing-song. 

“She told me you guys were acting suspicious, and to protect myself,” Callie hummed, lying in a halo of dark hair. 

Eli scoffed. “Well, she told *me* that I’m the weakest, and I have to watch my back around my powerful sister's.”

“She's trying to turn us against each other,” I said, prodding at my purple nose. “So, killing each other will be less of a tragedy and more like a game show. Mom wants to be entertained.”

Callie sat up, her eyes wide. “So, she's been–” 

“Brainwashing us.” Eli mumbled into Callie’s pillow. 

Mom almost had us.. 

I almost killed my sister, and then my brother. 

Thankfully, though, we had each other. 

Mom had zero idea we were aware of her attempted manipulation. 

Which made it more fun, I guess.

Mom thought she was playing us, but in reality, we were playing her. 

The three of us gathered as much knowledge on magic, learning both from Mom, and spell books we pulled out of the basement. First, we had to find a charm to break the binding spell. 

Which was harder I thought. 

In secret, we studied and searched for anything that would counteract what was holding us to the house. Maybe Mom subconsciously knew we were working against her, because every book containing counter-spells was either destroyed or hidden. So, we looked for rituals instead. 

In the meantime, we made sure to act like we were falling apart, arguing in front of Mom, so it looked like she was winning. It had to be subtle, so it didn't look forced. 

We stopped talking, shoving each other out of the way. We argued over food, over who was emptying the dishwasher, and shower privileges. It seemed like normal sibling antics, except the satisfaction on Mom’s face made me sick. 

She was revelling in our hatred for each other. 

Even if it was fake. 

With Mom and the coven none the wiser, we looked further into rituals, mainly ones that required a human sacrifice. 

Blood rituals, bone rituals, anything that *might* free us, we memorised them, and as years went by, my siblings and I planned to escape. On the days leading toward our birthday, Mom became visibly paranoid that we were planning to run away. I mean, we were. Every time I walked past my brother, I gave him a nod which meant things were still going to plan. Eli was in charge of our get-away car. Since the outside world was forbidden, we had to get… creative. 

Matthew Stillbrooke, an eighteen year old senior who lived down the block.

There was nothing special about him, except his grandfather's baby blue truck. 

Blood magic was the only way to get Matthew Stillbrooke’s car onto our driveway. Mom took away our phones a few months before the ritual, so simply *asking* Matthew was out of the equation. Callie is the strongest out of us, so she used transference, which is basically body swapping, but it's done through blood. Well aware that Callie casting Transference would wipe us out for at least a day, I knew we had to use it wisely. So, we waited until the day before the ritual. Mom was at the grocery store getting food, so we had maybe an hour. 

Callie sat cross legged on her bedroom floor while I held her hand. When we were little kids, my sister had mastered transference, easily slipping into the body of a volunteer, and then out again. This was different. 

This was a human, and humans aren't used to magic in their blood. If Callie fucked up, Matthew was dead, and so were our chances of stealing his truck. 

I can't actually tell you how Callie dealt with the spell, because five minutes in, Eli and I passed out before she could fully bleed into Matthew's body. I woke up in bed, maybe six hours later. Eli and a drained looking Callie were sitting on my bed. All they had to do was smile, for me to know Matthew’s truck was ours. 

Before I could talk to them fully and go over the plan, the coven made a surprise appearance, blessing each of us and wishing us luck, before plunging us into what they thought was a deep sleep. 

However, we were already one thousand steps ahead. Eli knew about the sleeping spell, so he had used his last energy to cast a protection spell. 

Which sent us to sleep, but not deep enough to render us helpless. 

Callie woke me up an hour before our twenty second birthday. The coven left us sleeping in the lounge, showering us with gifts and messages of good luck. 

I kicked flowers and good luck cards out of the way, dropping onto my knees next to Eli. I was already foggy headed from Callie casting Transference.

Matthew Stillbrooke’s body lay on the floor. Callie woke up two hours before us, creeping into his body and bringing him directly into our house. It's not like I wanted to make a human sacrifice, but you need to know, we were trapped. 

Prisoners. 

If there was any spell that didn't take a human life, we would have used it. Unfortunately, though, our time was running out. It was either draw Matthew's blood from his body, and sever the binding spell, or be caught and forced to brutally kill each other. 

Admittedly, I wanted to make the human sacrifice our mother, though it had to be someone with pure human blood. Mom still had Montgomery blood, despite her being human. I want to tell you about the blood ritual, but honestly, it feels wrong. 

I will say we said a prayer for the boy, before my brother sliced his throat open. Blood rituals require an entire body. 

We spoke the incantation, and I watched blood run, almost black, across the hardwood floor. 

The ritual required witches to utter the spell until the sacrifice had stopped breathing. I remember squeezing my siblings’ hands for dear life, my gaze flicking from the clock on the wall ticking down to midnight, to seeping scarlet dripping from my fingers. 

“Did it work?” Callie whispered, when Matthew's breath stilled. 

Eli lightly felt for a pulse that was no longer there. 

“Uh, yeah,” he said. “I think?”

I don't know what I expected. Maybe to feel like the suffocating weight on my chest had lifted, the invisible chains wrapped around my wrists to fall free. 

I didn't feel any of that. I felt the same. 

It was when I opened our front door and stepped over the threshold, that feeling finally slammed into me. The cool graze of night air tickling my face and blowing my hair back. The sky was inky oblivion above me, and it was real.

The concrete under my feet, the bug scuttling across my bare arm. 

Real. 

For a moment, I was terrified. Twenty one years of my mother’s attempted brainwashing, isolating me from the human world. I took a step back, my mind snapping in two, a cry climbing up my throat. I wanted to go back inside. I wanted to be sheltered from the humans who wanted my powers for themselves. But everything I had learned, I learned from the coven and my mother. The same people who were grooming my siblings and I into killers. 

I couldn't have jumped into the back of that truck fast enough. 

The seat was warm and cosy, and I pressed my head against the window, allowing myself to breathe. Eli took the front seat, and Callie sat in the back with me. Our destination was dad’s place in Virginia. Now we had an address. Before Mom took our phones away, I took the chance and sent him a friend request, only for him to accept several minutes later, with a message detailing his address and phone number. 

I had them on a sticky note tucked into my jeans. 

Eli started the truck, and with a satisfying grumble of gears, we took off. The night looked so beautiful under our birthday moon that was approaching totality. I held the sticky note with dad’s address, clutching between my clammy fingers. 

Samual Lockhart. 

He was human, so we would be safe. 

I wondered what he was like. 

Did he have kids now? Did I have human step siblings? 

I coughed, something warm slipping down my chin.

*Dad would…look after us*.

Outside, blurs of orange danced in the dark. 

I coughed again. 

*Fire*. 

I blinked, thinking it was far away. 

No. 

Figures coming towards us. 

Suddenly, something *physical* contorted my chest and stomach, my body writhing. I vomited lumps of thick red pouring from my mouth. This wasn't…right. I sat up, the sharp movement sending electroshocks down my spine. Pressing my face against the window, the blurs of orange were growing brighter. I could see them, figures dancing between flickering flames.

I knew it. 

The Montgomery coven were a thousand steps ahead of us. 

“Eli?” I reached for the sticky note, grasping it tightly. What my hand found instead was a sticky wetness on the seat. I retracted my hand, an explosive cough sending red spraying into my hands. 

In the glow of a passing streetlight, my sister’s head was pressed to the window, a fountain of bulging scarlet spluttering from her mouth, her body jerking. 

Shuffling back, I was already pawing for the lock on the floor. 

We learned of the Crescendo spell as kids. Velvet magic is banned in the witch community, but it is still practised in the shadows, and can be easily learned. Crescendo was cruel, a subtle death sentence only noticed when it was too late. It could be cast silently, and with one simple word, you can liquidise the body of any living thing. 

I remembered how Mom described it. 

She performed it behind a glass screen, popping the brains of a reptile. 

Little Callie screamed, and I shoved my head under the table. 

Eli started crying. He had already named the frog. 

“Like being dragged through a meat grinder, children,” Mom told us, a scary smile on her face. “It is agonising, and a horrific fate! Only to be used in means such as desperation, or perhaps greed.”

I didn't understand her words until my shaky fingers found the warm wet seeping down my chin. I coughed again. This time I couldn't breathe, and that fire, those fucking figures, were closing in on us. *Something is wrong.*  

The words were in my mouth, my hands around our dead sister, who had vomited up her own internal organs, painting the car seat. 

*Something is… wrong*. 

“Eli!” I spoke his name through a spluttered sob, my vision flickering. 

I could feel my brain leaking from my ears in warm rivulets. I could feel my body coming apart, Crescendo carving a hole in my soul. The truck came to a sputtering stop. I could see my mother’s silhouette outside, her grinning smile. 

I had.. to… stay… *awake.*

I screamed what was supposed to be a debilitating spell back at him. 

Except my mouth wouldn't work, wouldn't form words. 

“Shhh,” Eli murmured, tapping on the wheel.

In the eerie orange glow from outside, I could see my brother’s sly grin.

The bastard really *was* a Montgomery witch. 

“I'm waiting.” Eli tipped his head back, lips twitching into a smirk. His gaze trailed the sky, the moon we were born under. 

“For what?” I shrieked. 

My head hit the window with a *thunk*. 

Outside, our mother stood holding a flaming torch, a proud smile spread across her lips. Through tunnel vision, I saw my brother’s sly grin.

“Midnight.” Eli’s fingers whitened around the wheel. I could see that glitter of magic, that purplish hue in his eyes.

*Midnight.*

When, per our mother’s wish, he would tear my power from my soul. 

My gaze found the clock. 

11:56.

I wish I could tell you I secretly knew my brother would betray me. 

That he had been under our mother’s spell since were kids, moulding him into the perfect fucking psychopath. 

But no. If I'm being honest with you, the steak knife tucked into my jeans was in case we were caught. It was a last resort. I never thought I would be using it on my own blood. Who wasn't as strong as me. As Callie. That's why Eli decided *he* was going to take it from us. 

After all, since when was he strong enough to kill two people? 

Callie was dead, and I was sputtering blood. 

My ears were bleeding, and I could taste shapes. 

But I wasn't vomiting my organs. 

11:58.

Two minutes to midnight. 

22 years old. 

I won't say I felt satisfaction when I plunged the blade of my knife into my arm. 

Eli cried out, my pain slamming into him. 

I had minutes. And within those minutes, I decided I wasn't going to take my brother’s life with magic. I was aware of him lunging at me, with spells he barely knew, his teeth gritted, foaming from the mouth. A simple stun spell sent him falling back. I threw myself over the seat, and with him down, with his body paralysed, I delivered the final blow, plunging the knife into his head. 

I felt the crunch of the teeth splitting his skull open, that one brief flash of indescribable agony, before he was gone, and so were his sensation, his feelings, his emotions. 

The bastard died with a smile on his face, which took me off guard. 

Midnight. 

No fireworks. 

No fucking cake. 

I was covered in my siblings’ blood, a full witch. 

Just like all of those before me, every witch who refused to kill for that power. 

I read that you're supposed to feel euphoric, like the power is running through our veins, setting us alight.

It didn't feel like that. 

It felt like the world was crumbling around me. My brother’s blood was still warm on my hands, my sister's corpse lying across my knee. We were supposed to fucking escape. To win. 

I’ve been able to feel them my whole life, their sensations and emotions, all of them. Now I feel nothing, a cavernous oblivion dragging me down. 

When I crawled out of the car, I killed my psycho mother.

I had to, you don't understand. She turned me into a killer. 

She was the monster inside my brother’s head. 

The figures around her body didn't move, didn't speak. They stepped aside. 

They were smiling, their manic eyes drinking me in. 

I didn't know where else to go, so I went to my dad. 

When he opened the door, his eyes were squeezed shut. 

Like he knew one of us was going to come, but he didn't know which one. 

Dad didn't question the blood painting me. His smile melted my heart. He was so human, and that's what I needed. He led me into his kitchen, threw a blanket around me, and made me hot cocoa. 

Dad brought in a birthday card when I had showered my siblings blood away. 

I tried really hard to not notice that my brother’s name was originally written, and then scribbled out with mine. 

Dear (Eli) Willow!

Happy 22nd birthday! 

Love, 

Dad. 

I knew you could do it, son! (daughter!) Hey, do you mind doing that favor I asked? 

The world feels strange. I don't feel like a whole person despite adopting my siblings’ powers. When I clench my fist, Eli’s light magic glows between my fingers. I should feel excited. I should feel that happiness, that choking euphoria my mother told me about. 

I don't feel happy, though. 

I feel empty, even as a full witch. I'm terrified of the Montgomery coven. They already know where my dad lives. 

No cake.

No fireworks.

Not even a cat.

I just have a birthday card addressed to my brother, and magic I never wanted.

Project 2025 analysis,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQMymAu0I2M&t=409s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQMymAu0I2M&t=409s)

The first 30 minutes of this podcast is focused on the details of the Republican Project 2025, and what a second Trump term would look like. Commentary is from a progressive perspective. Covers issues such as birth control, abortion, IVF, deportation, internment camps, use of the military/national guard to respond to protests. It sounds like Trump's ability to accomplish horrific things was limited by the competence of his staff during the first term and he has a much more competent crew of people this time around. It's really scary.

The podcast is from former Obama staffers, who typically talk about polls, political messaging and legislative processes in ways that are calm and funny. Usually they tell Democrats to calm down, explain the broader context and lay out options for moving forward in effective ways. In this segment they sound rather freaked out.  They say people in general are under-reacting to this threat.

The podcast (rather than YouTube) version of this episode is called ""Trump's Second Term: Military in the Streets, Mike Johnson in the Sheets""",1b1ngi6,31,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1b1ngi6/project_2025_analysis/,"[""My husband, who follows US politics like his job even though we're Canadian, likes to throw this stuff into casual conversation.

The ‘Sword of Truth’ book series is the worst I’ve ever read,"I’m going to be spoiling a bunch of major plot points for the Sword of Truth series, written by Terry Goodkind, so you can either look at this as an opportunity to back out, or a chance to save yourself from ever reading this garbage. I am looking back on this series now after over a decade, so my memory has thankfully faded in many places, but I still can’t completely forget its crimes against literature.

I read this as a stupid teen who didn’t understand that perhaps some pieces of media should not be followed to their end. I should have put it down after the fourth book, but my parents, who saw I was reading every book, lovingly decided to keep buying the next one. I read 11 of these books, up to ‘Confessor’, before I at last put them down in disgust and never returned. Since then, Terry has written more of them. I do not know how he could have, given the ending of Confessor wrapping up everything 'cleanly', but I shall never read them.

**The ‘Good’ Old Days**

To understand how I got all the way to the end, I need you to understand that the early books are misleading. The first book makes it seem like a somewhat generic action fantasy setting, complete with an over-the-top evil conqueror, the MC’s powerful heritage, artifacts, and world-changing magic, etc. The first book sets up an interesting world with a few interesting twists and turns, and it’s got an exciting conclusion that wraps things up! Sure the main characters are both a bit too perfect, but all in all, nothing suspicious here...

...If you ignore the giant red flag late in the book where the MC gets magically enslaved and sexually abused for dozens of pages in vivid detail. I know, I should have put the book series down here, but I was a dumb teen.

Then there were several more books with rather less thought and effort put into them, though I will say that it still wasn’t a bad series, and there was less objectionable content in books 2-4. Well, aside from the semi-preachy pro-life bit where the MC tells a rape-victim that she shouldn’t abort her child. And more slavery. The author really enjoys enslaving the characters with magic collars that force obedience. 

Overall, not good, but not the worst. Not until…

**Fantasy Objectivism**

Around the fifth and sixth book, the veil is torn away and the author’s true political intent is brought to the reader’s attention with all the subtlety of a steaming hot shepherd’s pie to the face. Suddenly it becomes clear that Terry Goodkind has big opinions. 

The Communist army invades from the huge nation to the southeast. That’s not what they’re called, but they may as well be. Their modus operandi primarily consists of enslaving everyone they find and raping their women to death. That’s mostly it. It becomes very clear that the author is too busy slobbing on Ayn Rand’s knob to put together a coherent storyline, and the quality of the writing takes a steep nosedive into the comical.

Any veneer of an interesting fantasy world has been scraped up to make room for examples of how awful Communism is, and how they’re oppressing the inherent greatness of mankind. Life would be so great if it weren’t for those damn rapey, enslaving barbarians who only want to tear down the glorious, perfect empire the MC has taken over.

**Capitalism Wins Again**

As an example of just how ridiculous this series becomes, let me describe the plot of the sixth book, Faith of the Fallen. The MC is magically enslaved (of course) by a sexy evil mage lady and brought down to Communist-country to see how great Communism is. 

Then, I shit you not, the MC starts an incredibly successful business transporting goods via wagon. Through hard work, pride, and capitalism, he revolutionizes the means through which the Commies build monuments to pain. The people around him are wowed by his incredible ability to pull himself up by his bootstraps, including his sexy captor.

But then Communism comes to oppress him, arresting him and forcing him to carve stone statues for ~~Tiananmen Square~~ Liberty Square. However, instead of depicting soul-crushingly hideous and human demeaning statues, as is right and proper in Commie-land, he instead secretly carves a statue celebrating the glory and beauty of human life. The city is rocked by his audaciousness, and everyone starts a revolution to tear down the Communist oppressors around them!

… He literally just carves a nice statue of a man and a woman and overthrows a city.

**And Then The Writer Gets Lazy**

At some point, the author basically runs out of ideas and just starts putting out book after book of slow-paced nonsense that moves the story nowhere. It feels like you’re essentially reading the same arc with bad mages or Communists doing awful things and the protagonists reacting and winning, almost like it’s a monster of the week book where everything returns to zero at the end of each arc. 

You’ll get the frequent scenes of the Communists capturing some new caravan of nuns to rape to death. Somehow the author managed to desensitize me to even this ghastly shit. It feels like every other chapter becomes just another scene where the Big Bad Commie rapes some enslaved mage while they talk about how awful life should be, or some other horseshit. They’re kind of a blur to remember. Terry Goodkind whipped out the rape card so often that it genuinely got boring, and I don’t know how he did it.

The grand plot of Good Guys vs. Communism stalls for thousands of pages. Oh, some minor things will pop up here and there, but ultimately everything is in a holding pattern until the last book.

**Ends With a Whimper**

The final book, at least until the author shat out more, is Confessor. And it is… the culmination of all the trash that has transpired so far. At this point the author is having full on political debates with the strawman, his Big Bad Commie, while his perfect protagonists become his mouthpieces. This masturbatory dialog takes up huge portions of the book.

Then a bunch of nonsense happens and the author sweeps every problem away into a plot hole. The End.

Really, Terry? All the evil witches are sent to hell? All the Communists are just swept into another dimension? And for some reason the MC's magic-nullifying relatives, who aren't evil but threaten to erase all magic users through eventual interbreeding, ALL decide that they also want to go to the Rape-Commie Dimension? Why would they unanimously decide that? And it couldn’t be done before now for… reasons? That’s the ending we’re going with?

OK, Terry.

**TL/DR: Save Yourselves**

Please learn from my mistakes. Do not read the Sword of Truth. It’s a trap that disguises itself as decent fantasy in its early books, only to unveil its weird fetishistic interpretation of politics and its ever dwindling effort to involve an actual plot in its ramblings.

There are so many great fantasy books, or even mediocre books, that are more worth your time. Terry Goodkind’s stuff isn’t even worth hate-reading, as I can attest. Instead you’ll find his awful novels living rent free in your head for years, popping to the forefront of your mind every time you think of shitty media.

There are plenty of ways to show authoritarianism as bad without such a focus on rape. The protagonist\'s magic eventually just turns into a lazy deus ex machina.

How do I find closure and heal? Miscarriage or abortion?,"

Massively long story short:   

Girlfriend had abdominal pain for about  10 days, I asked her to go  to the doctor as I was across the country.. She went to an abortion  clinic instead.   

When she was there they scanned her and told her they couldnt hear a  heartbeat. She was  roughly 7 weeks pregnant and she measured 6 weeks  on the scan, the ultrasound tech said they couldnt hear a heartbeat...   just one scan, the same day was the day she decided she decided that was  her moment to  abort.   

Im forever left wondering if it was too early to  see the heartbeat.  No confirmation. This was processed as an abortion  not a miscarriage.   

How do I heal? How do I get closure. She says shes sure it was a  miscarriage because of the pain for so long, no heartbeat on the one  scan and date off by a week.   

I've heard that sometimes 6 weeks is too early to see the heartbeat.  Really hurts to believe the pregnancy may have been inadvertently  ended.

He may do something desperate.”\n\n19 David noticed that his attendants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child was dead. “Is the child dead?” he asked.\n\n“Yes,” they replied, “he is dead.”\n\n20 Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.\n\n21 His attendants asked him, “Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!”\n\n22 He answered, **“While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, ‘Who knows? The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live.’ 23 But now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”**\n\n24 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and made love to her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The Lord loved him; 25 and because the Lord loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.[c]\n\n2 Samuel 12 (emphasis mine)\n\nIt is debatable how clear-headed David is in that moment, but the truth of what he says is there: the child will not return to this life no matter what David does.\n\nYour closure will be found in trying again. It didn’t work out this time, and nothing you can do will change that.\n\nYour girlfriend’s pain was real, and the referral was reasonable in her condition. It is natural to wish it had played out differently; it is unreasonable to leap to the conclusion that you were betrayed if you have never previously had reason to believe that.\n\nMourn for what may have been but ultimately wasn’t; try to push forward towards what may still be. You wanted to be father to this child, and you will want to be father to the next one.']"

Weekly Abortion Debate Thread,"Greetings everyone!

Wecome to [r/Abortiondebate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/). Due to popular request, this is our weekly abortion debate thread.

This thread is meant for anything related to the abortion debate, like questions, ideas or clarifications, that are too small to make an entire post about. This is also a great way to gain more insight in the abortion debate if you are new, or unsure about making a whole post.

In this post, we will be taking a more relaxed approach towards moderating (which will mostly only apply towards attacking/name-calling, etc. other users). Participation should therefore happen with these changes in mind.

Reddit's TOS will however still apply, this will not be a free pass for hate speech.

We also have a **recurring weekly meta thread** where you can voice your suggestions about rules, ask questions, or anything else related to the way this sub is run.

Improved org-roam templates,"I have been using org-roam for a while. But I have found its template system confusing.

I think there are two use cases:

1. Creating a new node (for this the templates work well)

2. Adding data to an already existing node.

The templates are also used when the user runs org-roam-node-find and the selected node-title does not exist. This is probably whey templates in org-roam behave very different than org templates.

Last weekend I finally spent time and address some of these issues. The commits are here:

https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/compare/main...dmgerman:org-roam:main

for example.The first template will only work when creating a new file (see :create-file). It will ask for the node-title and use it to create the file (the slug).


     (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates
                  `(""A"" ""area"" plain
                    ""%?""
                    :target (file+head ,(eval (dmg-roam-build-path ""areas/${slug}.org""))
                                       ,(eval (dmg-roam-template ""plain.txt"")))
                    :create-file yes
                   :unnarrowed t))
     
If the path is provided, the user will not be asked for the destination. if the template has :create-file no, and the file does not exist, the capture will be aborted.

In contrast, this template will ask for a node id, and then search for the ""Tasks"" header. node and node+olp will not create a new file.
     
     (add-to-list 'org-roam-capture-templates
                  `(""t"" ""todo"" entry
                    ""*** TODO %?\n%t\n%a\n\n%i""
                    :target (node+olp nil (""Tasks""))
                   :unnarrowed t))
     
     
If the node id is provided, the user will NOT be asked for the node id.",1b1msff,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/1b1msff/improved_orgroam_templates/,"[""This is great, I've struggled with (and abandoned) any workflow which added captures to a node.

I don't get the conservatives' fixation and cult around Trump,"How could they support such a mean bully!

I'm joking. But in all honesty he doesn't seem like much of a conservative to me. More like a useful idiot. He's actually fairly tame and fairly liberal.

Donald was the first president that was pro LGBT from the start. The dude even created Trump Pride merch during Pride month. Compare this to when the Bush years still had Republicans advocating for sodomy laws and creationism to be taught in school. He sort of opened up to drug legalization too. Donald was probably the least religious president so far. I mean the guy has had three wives.

His views are mostly in line with a 2000s Democrat. If you go back 20 or 30 years ago and listen to what Barack Obama and Bill Clinton were saying about the border and immigration you'll realize that's not any different to what Trump is saying now. Besides abortion, I'd say even Biden was more conservative in the 90s than Trump is now.

I could understand if conservatives acknowledged all of this but just saw him as the best thing they've got at the moment but that's not really the case. They view him as the savior of traditional values almost as if he's some sort of religous figure.

It's also funny when liberals accuse a progressive who's going the speed limit of being a fascist.",1b1mpai,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeSocialist/comments/1b1mpai/i_dont_get_the_conservatives_fixation_and_cult/,"[""I agree, I don't understand how anyone thinks Trump is conservative.

So wanted to post congratulating Rachel on winning. The judge saw her evidence that she never posted to tiktok. He chose her for a reason. Judges can’t be manipulated like the internet trolls can. Also that judge is KNOWN for siding with fathers. Narcissists HATE TO LOSE (see the caption) ,This nanny stuff was the same week they had COVID. She also had an abortion in Jan. Then he posted stuff from when she had breast augmentation. Also can y’all not see where she is calling him a liar in those messages??? Rachel isn’t posting her evidence because she was advised by her lawyer not too. When you lawyer up you shut up. Y’all need to look into reactive abuse. When I saw the busted up dash I could tell she was fighting for her life to get out of that car. I can see Romeo for exactly what he is and so did the judge.

Unbearable depression,"I am 5 weeks pregnant and I am already unbearably depressed. 
This baby was wanted, and was planned however the shock has not worn off since finding out. 
I feel like I’ve ruined my life, I’ll never be able to do the things I loved to do or wanted to do in the future. I’ve not stopped crying for days and I’m verging on the option of an abortion to just make it all go away. 

I’m just so angry and sad. I honestly feel that at the end of these 9 months there will be a baby but also a death of myself, and I am slow marching through that grieving process. I can honestly find no happiness in any of this, I can’t imagine the happy family I once was able to - I can only see depression and a ruined life in the future. I just want to get off this bus.

PPH not helping with ultrasound ,"Hello,  I had a medical abortion at home using an online service that mails you the pills. I went to schedule a visit at a local PPH. I told them my health concerns and that I'm still testing positive. The original provider  recommended a pelvic scan to confirm no pregnancy or left over tissue. I lost my medical insurance shortly after I had my son and left my full time job, so I was really hoping to get services and pay them using a sliding scale. I've used PPH many times in the past for reproductive care. Anyways I'm so disappointed because I was told that they cannot schedule me an ultrasound appointment because it's reserved for pregnancy and pregnancy concerns. Sooooo how is testing positive 4 weeks after not a pregnancy concerns? I know the tests can remain positive for quite sometime but, I'm just trying to get a peace of mind. I've never been turned away from PPNE until now.... ",1b1lzmd,2,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1b1lzmd/pph_not_helping_with_ultrasound/,"['Where did you get your pills?

I think if you definitely want to go to planned parenthood then you could schedule a routine follow up visit and then when you’re in with the provider go over your concerns and maybe they’ll order hcg or schedule an ultrasound (if you’re interested in birth control it could be a visit for that). Otherwise if you don’t have a doctor or insurance you can Google ""title x clinic"" or ""fqhc"" and see if anywhere has any upcoming appointments because both of those type of places typically see patients without insurance.\n\nBut to give some more info, it’s totally normal to test positive after an abortion at 4 weeks. I tell patients to test at 5 weeks and if still positive test again at 6 weeks.

I lost a part of me and I just needed to vent,"Hello all,

I really just wanted to get this out there as it helps with my own grieving.

My husband and I have been together for the last 10 years. We had discussed having an ours baby but we were also happy with the children/step children we do have. Basically, we have all boys. My son and his 3 sons. No girls in the picture at all. We wanted an ours baby but only if it was a girl. We talked about abortion and such and he is ok with abortion but I am not. Knowing that pushing the topic could cause a strain on us, we left it at that and have been going on with our lives as is. 

Well, about 3 years ago, we looked into IVF treatments. This allowed us to pick the gender of our child. So we started and have been on the journey. Well, 3 weeks ago was my first embryo transfer. Everything was going so well and all tests were coming in positive.

This past Saturday, it all went bad very quickly. I started bleeding. Like a lot. I called my doctor and they said don't worry. It could be nothing. Don't stress to much. Yesterday, I found out that the pregnancy is officially gone. 

I understand abortion is a hot topic and so are miscarriages, but knowing my child was just a clump of cells didn't hurt any less. No amount of dehumanizing it has helped. I lost a baby. I lost a child. She wasn't born yet, had no face, no heart, nothing and I still can't stop crying. It still hurts and it probably will for quite some time.

Sorry if I got a little much there at the end. I just needed to get it out.",1b1ll2w,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1b1ll2w/i_lost_a_part_of_me_and_i_just_needed_to_vent/,"['r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

CMV: People who insist a 3 month old fetus is a person do not usually understand the distinction between person and human,"I'll start off saying I'm pro choice, I think it abortion should not be regulated by the government beyond that which any other medical procedure is. It should be strictly between a woman and her doctor.  

Anywho, a fetus is clearly a human. If you get it's DNA it'll be human. We'd classify it as such. However, the word ""person"" implies personhood which is a concept, not something rooted in science. This would be open to interpretation. Does personhood start with consciousness? Does it start earlier? If so when? Is our personhood one unending entity transcending time and space? It's all philosophy and has no place blocking someone else's medical procedure. 

I would assume that since one is a concept and the other a scientific fact it would be easy to distinguish. However, I often see comments on social media which lead me to believe that a large portion of prolife people who argue that a fetus is a person do not distinguish the difference.

Sorry if I missed the point.', 'Are there other humans who are not persons, or is this limited to fetuses of 3 months or less?', 'That is like saying male and boy are not the same.\n\nDog and canine are not the same.\n\nFeline and cat, \n\nPerson and human are the same thing.', 'We use philosophy to block medical procedures all the time.

If they\'re not a person, no issue; if they are, you can\'t compel another human being to subordinate their medical well-being for another; you can\'t ethically compel the continuation of a pregnancy any more than you can a kidney transplant. \n\nThat being said, your argument is that because *you* don\'t think its a person, no one else should be able to impose their philosophical viewpoint on you and thus constrain your choices.\n\nWell how about a day old infant? I\'m talking 24 hours out of the womb. Is there a meaningful distinction between that child\'s mind today and one day prior? I\'d suggest there isn\'t, and yet one might suggest that they\'re more of a person today than they were a day ago; which is a philosophical distinction. Shall I suggest they have no right to intercede with me tossing that kiddo in a bin because *I* don\'t think they\'re a person? For whatever reason, birth seems to be the *only* clear line.\n\nNow, I\'m not saying you\'re advocating for late term abortions, but by even making that distinction of ""late term"" I\'m suggesting that\'s somehow *more* ""bad."" So are mid/early term/3 month abortions *less* ""bad?"" If so why? That conversation existing isn\'t a rejection of the distinction between humanness and personhood, its a debate about at what point during a pregnancy does personhood becomes a relevant consideration. \n\nIn my view that personhood line exists somewhere between embryo and birth, but I personally have no idea where that is. Some people are going to put that line earlier or later, because you have to draw that line somewhere. Given that that\'s totally subjective, some people are going to put it earlier, and some later.\n\nHowever, the fact that some might err earlier on this does not mean they haven\'t thought about at what point a fetus is endowed with personhood.', 'I’m also very pro-choice but I would encourage you to use a different argument.

There are smart and dumb people on both sides of the debate. I myself am apathetic to the whole thing. I think whatever works best for the family works best. In other words, I am relatively pro choice. Yet, I know people who have considered your very question with depth and still came out pro life. They understand the debate of when a thing becomes a person, they just take a *different* view.

According to your thought process, a severely brain damaged person is no longer a person because they have no faculties resembling personhood. It would still be murder to kill this individual.

Forced into Pregnancy ,"
3 months ago, I was continuously raped by my middle school boyfriend, which led into pregnancy. We met in the 6th grade, we both sat next to eachother due to the seating plan, so we became friends. Then by the end of 7th grade, we became a ‘couple’. It was one of those couples that didn’t have anything but platonic feelings. Skip past to 8th grade, we were still in a relationship. But, he started to use drugs, smoke weed, and drink alcohol, so naturally, he became different, more aggressive. I was raised to not take part in those activities, in which I demanded to break up. He didn’t take it too lightly, so he threatened me; if I left him, he’d commit suicide. To reduce any circumstances, I stayed with him. Even though I didn’t feel comfortable, he suggested we have sex with each other. I was hesitant, but accepted, just so no one comes to harm. We did it at my house during afterschool hours, when my mom had work. I’ll refrain myself from going into the graphic details, but we had sex which would later turn into continuous rape. He hadn’t worn a condom, or pull out. He’d just cum inside me. Even when I told him it started to hurt really bad, or cried for him to stop, he’d ignore me and kept going. This happened everyday for 2 weeks, until one day, he was acting extra aggressive, he’d start to physically abuse me, and he thrusted harder during penetration. The unusual extra pain that day motivated me to tell my mom about everything which has been happening to me for those past few weeks. She believed every single word. Since that day, she’d pick me up after school, to make sure there was nobody who could possibly contact me on my way home. Then, few weeks later, I took a blood pregnancy test, which tested positive. Thus, as of right now, I don’t think I can handle a child, I start freshmen year in September, and I don’t think I have enough time to balance between raising a newborn, and focusing on school. But, a part of me would crumble if I pursue abortion.",1b1lda9,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1b1lda9/forced_into_pregnancy/,"['Please be aware that due to the nature of this sub, you may receive unwanted private messages or private chat requests from creepy users.

Conservatives struggle to find coherent message on Alabama IVF ruling,"Trump said he supported IVF and called on the Alabama legislature to act quickly to find a solution to preserve IVF in the state.

Lila Rose, the president of the anti-abortion rights group Live Action, told Axios Trump's response was ""very disappointing"" and ""shows ignorance.""

She said the American IVF industry is mired in ethical dilemmas and ""riddled with abuses,"" and that even in European countries with more IVF regulations, the practice is ""still problematic.""

She argued that an ethical infertility treatment would be more along the lines of NaProTechnology to treat underlying conditions rather than ""bringing life into existence in petri dishes.""

""No one is promised a child,"" Rose said. ""No matter how much money you pay, even with IVF.""

Its previous rulings applied to fetuses in the womb. The latest ruling is the first to apply to embryos in a hospital's cryogenic nursery, Parker noted.

A 2018 amendment to the Alabama constitution — supported by anti-abortion rights groups — enshrined language about the ""rights of unborn children.""

The Alabama Pro-Life coalition supported the amendment at the time but noted that the implications on IVF weren't part of the discussion, the group's president, Eric Johnston, told Axios.

Johnston added that he agreed with the recent Alabama IVF ruling and that ""taking care of these embryos"" was the central issue.

Leftover embryos could be preserved for later use by the parents, put up for adoption or stored until they ""die a natural death,"" Johnston noted.

If an IVF clinic ""negligently or wantonly causes the death of the embryo — which it would be a death because it is an organism — is that not actionable in some way?"" Johnston asked.",1b1laai,14,3,https://www.axios.com/2024/02/27/frozen-embryos-alabama-supreme-court-republicans,"['Republicans. In.

Pregnant Stray Cat Keeps Visiting My Backyard - How To Help Her Deliver Outside?,"Plz send videos on how to assist (from a distance, hopefully, unless something goes wrong) a random stray tabby cat giving birth outside. 

I’m putting a box or plastic container on its side with warm blankets. But it’s going to get cold tonight so maybe those automatic hand warmers would help? Under blankets so it won’t be too hot. 

She is soo friendly towards me but I’ve never trapped a cat and even if I could get her in a transport cage, I don’t know who would take care of her. 

I don’t really trust the rescues around here simply bc they are overwhelmed with pets as it is. 

The shelter here is a kill shelter and I don’t want them to abort her kittens in the process of spaying mamma cat. Hell, they’d probably euthanize the whole kit n caboodle. (I’m in LA, the shelters are overrun.)

She looks like she’s ready to pop but she’s been looking that way for 3 days now! She waddles like she’s pregnant, she’s hyper friendly, rolling around & showing me her big belly. 

Maybe she just has worms or a medical problem but her nipples look big. I’m trying to earn her trust so I can feel her belly to check for movement. 

What are the signs of impending labor? 

How to upload pic & 10 sec video?
Plz send videos. I tried Kitten Lady but didn’t see any birthing tutorials, only kitten aftercare.

really struggling with my partner having a kid.,"so i apologize in advance, im feeling a lot of things right now and i hope this can be a safe space to vent my frustrations….
i’m 22F and have met this guy who is really amazing in every way. we hit it off at first and fell quickly for each other, but about a week into us getting a little more “serious” he told me that he had a kid. apparently he had told me this previously and i forgot (i’m just recently getting clean from addiction, at about 30 days). i was crushed but i really, really like him a lot and have never met someone more compatible with me. i asked him if it was planned and he said no, and that he mentioned other options to the mother (abortion or adoption) and his kid’s mother declined, so he’s committed to fatherhood now. it also hurts that he has to talk frequently with his ex for the well-being of the child and there’s nothing i can do about that. i’m just so angry, why would you just get pregnant at nineteen and be like “fuck it”? what’s the fucking appeal? i can’t imagine a world where i’d accidentally get pregnant after knowing someone two weeks and be like “fuck it let’s raise a kid” like what??? it hurts so much because the kid is 2 years old and i’m realizing now that once things become more serious down the line, the kid is going to be just as much a part of my life as my partner’s. i never asked to have a kid. why did he do it???? i’m just angry. i can’t make him go back in time and i know this is selfish, but he ruined this by just “accidentally” having a kid he claims he didn’t want at the time but he loves him now. toast can’t be bread no more, the kid is a fully breathing being and my heart hurts because the more i try to cope with maybe learning to live around his family situation, the more pain i feel and i’m going to have to end things realistically. i’m tired of breeder culture ruining my love life. will i ever find love in a society where everyone thinks the end all be all goal of life is to fucking reproduce? i don’t get it. almost all of these parents always complain about how stressful parenthood is. THEN FUCKING WHY DO IT ???????? NOBODY IS FORCING YOU. i can’t imagine he would ever find someone who’s ok with dating a single father, why would they????? i’m just so angry. why are people so obsessed with these fucking crotch goblins. 

i would never say these things to him and i am of course going to articulate it in a better way. but these are my raw feelings. please just tell me everything will be okay and i will find a childfree love one day. :(

NEVER mention your childfreedom on your dating profile. Doing that would be extremely naive. If you do that, you are literally telling breeders what lie they need to tell you in order to date you. So if you are upfront, you might very well end up with a breeder who pretends to be childfree and waits for you to change your mind.\n\nInstead, you need to screen. Basically, get the other person to reveal their stance on kids before you reveal your childfreedom. That way, you should be able to avoid lying breeders who pretend to be childfree and wait for you to change your mind.\n\nTo avoid wasting your time on non-childfree people, you need to take care of this during the early stages of dating.

I am afraid that is a reality we all must accept and it has many consequences throughout life. However so long as you know your own mind and the things most important to you I have no doubt you will find someone. No doubt at all. Another important thing to bear in mind is that as painful as ending this relationship now may feel, the alternative was *much* worse.\n\nI personally cannot understand, simply cannot empathise with nor appreciate the mentality of those who agree to raise a partner's child from a prior relationship. Why? On *any* level why would someone choose to live through that situation??? Add to it the fact you are clearly committed to the CF life as demonstrated by your decision here... I can only *imagine* the frustration and suffering you would experience even though your soon-to-be-ex-partner only has partial parental rights.\n\nWorse still; a situation could easily occur where your ex-partner was pitchforked into becoming **sole** parent... Life threatening accidents occur every day and it does not speak well for the mentality and personality of a girl who is willing to become a mother at such a young age under the scenario you described. Therefore her loss of legal custody is also a very real possibility to consider. In that situation, through no fault of your own and literally overnight you would become a full time step-mother... The thought alone scares me and I underwent a vasectomy 46 years ago! To live with that threat hanging over your head twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week would be unbearable. At least it would be unbearable to me.\n\nPerhaps a final aspect to think about is that no matter how committed to you this man may be/may have become, he would still share a child with another girl.

However I fear there would *always* be the potential for infidelity springing from that fact, even if it were on a 'meaningless' or 'casual' basis.\n\nAt the end of the day you made the correct decision. The fact that despite so much emotional pain you *did* make it speaks volume for your character and your grasp on the things in life which are most important to you.

So, MIL brings up an issue, it gets heated and MIL then has to deescalate the situation? Y'all sound mature as fuck.

Maybe she means in the future?

Sounds like she thinks you two would be bad parents.

Any sympathy I had is fucking gone. Fully on MIL's side now.

Yeah, bet she was hoping you'd get the vaccine for yourself and your kids so you wouldn't fucking die, idiot.

>I feel like she thinks I stole him from her. I have been nothing but good to her. I’m honestly done trying to have a good relationship with her. She’s ruining my mental peace . This is just a few things she’s done.

Oh you poor baby. Moving your plague carrying ass into her home and arguing with her at every turn. You're such a victim. 

> Am I exaggerating ? Or does she sound toxic? Also while she’s away for work for the week I offer to take care of her dogs which means cleaning up after their bathroom time and also making them food. To the point I would feed them from my food.

Fun fact, if you don't know exactly how to make dog food, you'll make them sick.

> I love dogs and I didn’t mind. (Currently stay at home mom while fiancé works and pays our rent). Recently the dogs got sick the week she was THERE) she blamed for the dogs getting sick which was impossible as she was looking after them that week.

This could easily still be your fucking fault, depending on what you fed them, which you didn't bother to mention in this fucking word vomit. 

> Fiancé and I were tired the next day when she asked to get them pedialyte and fiancé told her we weren’t going to go. She then proceeded to block me on her phone. Couldn’t call or send messages. 

I bet that felt good on her end.

>I confronted her and she lied and said she wouldn’t do that. The day we picked her and went to Porto’s up I put some things in the trunk.

"Angry Observation: Steve Daines, Rick Scott, and why Republicans can't do anything right",">A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.  
>  
>\- *WarGames*

It was here, around a year ago, that we heard that Montana Senator Steve Daines was taking over the mantle of Florida Senator Rick Scott as NSRC chair. His job, basically, is to make Senate Republicans win. He's got a pretty favorable map, too, and to stop him Democrats will have to triumph in two out of the following three states: Ohio, Texas, and his native Montana, all of which voted for Trump in 2020.

There was lots of anticipation from both sides. The idea was that they'd kicked out Scott, a comically obvious grifter, and now had adults in the room. The Republicans could go back to nominating winners, and with such a favorable map they couldn't possibly blow it.

Well, it's looking worse and worse every day. There are eight seats the Republicans can theoretically target right now and only two they have to defend. Of Daines's star recruits, four (WI, MI, PA, and MT) have potential residency issues. Meanwhile, the Republicans somehow managed to take a swing state like Arizona where the Democrats had ran out their own incumbent, and made it basically safe D through Kari Lake. The party has absolutely zero plan to win Nevada, where they fell short last time, and is putting all their chips on this car dealership owner in Ohio against Sherrod Brown. To recap: the GOP needs to flip two out of eight of these seats, and they've already got one for free since R+40 West Virginia is an open seat where a very popular, self-funding governor is running.

&#x200B;

[There's arguably never been a Senate map this favorable to one party.](https://preview.redd.it/0tv0nrayd6lc1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=247caebcc55c5182806e073b88398f5c2435ae6f)

Steve Daines needs just a *single flip* out of six states Trump won in 2016 or Nevada, including states like Montana, which voted for Trump by fifteen points, and Ohio, which voted for him by eight. And his odds are looking like 50/50 right now.

To understand why things are going so poorly, we've got to look deeper than Daines.

Back in 2022, the Senate Republicans were hurt by a lot of things, but perhaps the most important factor was endless pandering to a right-wing base that was out of touch with America. They nominated whackos like Dr. Oz and Herschel Walker and Blake Masters, got outraised by an unfathomable ratio, and then lost because they didn't have coherent responses to the abortion issue.

This central calculus hasn't changed, so what Daines has to basically do now is find recruits that the MAGA people love but are also strong enough to beat some pretty tough incumbents with no money and no organization. Rick Scott dealt with this a different way. When Mitch McConnell, his direct superior, said that the Republicans would avoid endorsing social security privatization and abortion bans and that they would play damage control with Trump's objectively terrible picks, Scott basically mutinied.

[Was this good for the party? Probably not. Did it get Scott a lot of TPUSA speaking deals? For sure.](https://preview.redd.it/z8rnm87bd6lc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5eec3c357f3a2a4386a284cf6314d6024d8f9ed)

Of course, this was bad for the party's prospects in November, but was good for Scott personally. The septuagenarian Senator is now one of Trump's favorites. While he might've blown the midterms, he's more powerful within MAGAworld.

Daines's bad decisions aren't as obvious. But, it's way too late for anybody to kick out Trump and his people, so Daines's only option is to just let Trump nominate whoever he wants and hope he can play ball with whatever is chosen. Put simply, if Daines *tried* to stop Kari Lake, he'd lose, and probably get kicked out and replaced with somebody even worse.

What we have here is Republican brain-drain. All the best recruits would really rather sit this one out. Daines's party is also totally broke, by the way, and it's getting worse. Kevin McCarthy's unceremonious ouster last year robbed the House Republicans of a prolific fundraiser when they were already pretty outgunned. They absolutely need that money, which puts lots of stress on the Republican organization as a whole and takes stuff that could otherwise be helping the NSRC. Meanwhile, the RNC (Ronna Romney's retirement changes absolutely nothing here-- whoever replaces her is going to do the same stuff) is paying Trump's legal bills, and Trump, who actually does have the grassroots fundraising power some of the Dems' better candidates do, is not sharing.

[These are California Biden district Republicans the GOP has no hope of winning without.](https://preview.redd.it/wet8x407d6lc1.jpg?width=406&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d75629b023ee2abf4e81d7ca06db9e8d46e838ac)

Not only has the GOP been robbed of solid recruits, they appear to be totally devoid of them. Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, a very close state that the Republicans should be at least trying to win, seems to be retiring from politics after he was placed in the unenviable place of deciding whether or not to impeach a member of the Biden cabinet. There are similar potential winners walking around in Nevada and Michigan and Pennsylvania, but they aren't running, because that's a lot of hassle for an uphill battle.

Daines basically has decided to fix the problem by bringing in his rich buddies to run for these seats, to take the tension off of him. The NSRC's recruits are Tim Sheehy (MT), Jim Justice (WV), Bernie Moreno (OH), Dave McCormick (PA), Eric Hovde (WI), etc. etc. All of these candidates are filthy rich. Trump appears to have greenlit most of these. McCormick, Sheehy, and Justice are the presumptive nominees for their races, while Moreno is gaining against incumbent Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. And guess what? Surprise surprise, they've also got a lot of unanswered questions about their candidacies, which we'll get to in a second.

Putting all your chips on a pack of Republican elites was a terrible idea for a lot of reasons, but it's dubious whether or not it will even solve the NSRC's money problem. Rich people are rich because they don't like giving all of their money away, especially not on obviously dumb investments. Daines's picks don't solve the central problem of the campaign, which is that the Republican Party is too far-right for the general electorate and unwilling to change, which means they're fighting an uphill battle, which discourages them from dumping money into these races, which makes the battle even more uphill.

Even if billionaire Tim Sheehy spent all the liquid assets he has on this one race, a hell of a gamble for a guy that doesn't even have a Wikipedia page, odds are he'd be pretty dramatically outraised by Tester, who has set a goal of *$500 million*. Montana has a little over a million people in it.

[Was it really a good idea to gamble on a guy without a Wiki page?](https://preview.redd.it/cnfuym77g6lc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1e526f003dac500ebc96cfdeb975ce7014d1cd6)

The big problem with any organization outsourcing basically their entire job to some other team is that people make mistakes. Especially oligarchical puppetmasters like who Daines is running, many of whom have no political experience. The result is a bunch of blank slates for the better-armed Democrat incumbents to define however they please. And wouldn't you know it, it turns out when you take these swamp monsters and put them under the spotlight, bad stuff comes to the surface. McCormack, only two years after the Oz debacle, apparently is from Connecticut. Mike Rogers is a literal Californian elite, and this is the guy they're running in an open seat. So little is known about Sheehy's past that it's an open question as to whether or not he's even lived in Montana for most of his life, and even less clear is how the fuck he went from a junior Navy officer in active duty to the founder of a sprawling aerial firefighting corporation. Sheehy is also being sued for negligence in the death of a teenage girl on one of his planes.

The result is the Senate GOP has basically forfeited all the Biden 2020 states. The only ones they're shooting at are Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia. They need two of these, and one of them is a freebie. *All they have to do* is come on top once in two states that voted for Trump by fifteen percent and a half million votes, and both of those look like uphill battles right now.

Anyway, the thing is, Daines is just doing the best with what he's got. If he doesn't bring in the shadowy elites to run, he's just going to be stuck with MAGA activists that would rather fight him than the Democrats and more washed-up hacks that would get destroyed on the abortion issue. Unlike Rick Scott, Daines's alliance with Trump is more about winning than becoming a MAGA star. If it weren't for Daines, the Republicans might be running Matt Rosendale in Montana (far-right Representative who lost this exact same race six years ago, also a carpetbagger), Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania (far-right state senator who lost by twenty points in 2022), and Frank LaRose in Ohio (who attempted to get ballot measures and abortion restricted on the ballot, only to be resoundingly humiliated).

The GOP is uniting behind him and the primary won\'t be competitive. He is a candidate with flaws, spending most of his life in Minnesota and not being well known until he ran for Senate. That being said, tying Tester to Biden could be very effective for Sheehy, and the fact he voted to convict the president twice that won the state by 16 points in 2020. He also voted against confirming all 3 of Trump\'s justices and voted to confirm KBJ. He has an effective ""farmer"" image and has strong ties to the state, but his voting record isn\'t much different from a generic Democrat. Trump at the top of the ticket will also likely help Sheehy by driving out more conservative voters, and Tester didn\'t have to deal with this in 2018. Tester will probably outrun Biden by at least 10, but can he outrun him by 15-16? I\'m not sure. \n\nThe big difference between the 2022 map and 2024 map is the 2022 competitive races were in narrow Biden states while the 2024 races (MT/OH) are in states Trump won by significant margins.

Not every election is going to be 2022 where every single incumbent holds on. \n\nAs for the other races, I expect Democrats to sweep MI, AZ, WI, PA and NV at the senate level. I\'d be very surprised if Republicans managed to win any of these. Then again, Trump coattails can make races unexpectedly closer, just look at how Gary Peters nearly lost in 2020. I think Gallego probably outruns Trump by a few points (who I think is the underdog in AZ anyway) but I can\'t imagine that many Trump voters voting for him. Hovde is a carpetbagger, I expect him to lose by like 5. Casey is a very strong incumbent, I expect him to win by 5 at minimum. Rosen\'s race could be a bit closer than WI/PA, but I still think she probably wins by 2-4.']"
"AITAH for breaking a promise to my best friend and ""embarrassing"" her?","Alright, so this is my first time posting here and I'm very new to the app itself but I follow most of the stories on Facebook and Tiktok.

Okay, before I would begin, I'd like to plead with you to leave your judgement of me till you read the entire story to the end. I know I might sound really naive and dumb for most parts but I was quite young then.

For  context, I'm a 22F and a university student majoring in Microbiology. I'm just entering my third year of the five year program. 
My ""best friend"", let's call her ""Sam"" is a year older than me and is almost through with her third year majoring in the same course. 
Sam and I have been friends since junior high, she was popular and outgoing and I was reserved and just enjoying my own space.

Our friendship started weirdly, Sam was one of the people who would bully and laugh at me, although not directly but she made no effort to help or stop anyone, which she could have because she was very popular. Then suddenly one day, we were friends. 

Sam and I were also very different, she dated a lot of guys before we even got into senior high and made out with almost all, not counting those at the T and D hangouts. 
I on the other hand has only dated one guy, during my last year of highschool. The same guy, who got ""frustrated"" by my reserved and shy nature and cheated on me with Sam. 
She was hardly apologetic and neither was he, all he said was, I wasn't as ""mature"" as Sam and the other girls so he was forced to cheat on me.
Mature being, I refused to have intense make out sessions with him and have sex with him(I was a Virgin even till I graduated and got made fun of for that.) even after telling him I was not ready and was not going to be forced into doing something I was uncomfortable with.

But thankfully, I had an amazing Mom who made me see the worth in choosing to keep myself till I'm comfortable enough to get into any sexual relationship and she made me feel proud of my choices and not ashamed because society has now deemed it ""abnormal"" to choose to not sleep around or have a sexual relationship.

Also, thankfully, as young as I was, I was already emotionally mature and after a day of crying my eyes out, I realized neither of them were worth it.
I had already begun therapy to help heal from the bullying, body shaming and assaults and was really in a better place, so I quickly realized neither of them were worth me becoming depressed over and that was the last time I'd let anyone bring me down or make me question my worth. 

So after graduating from highschool, I cut everyone off. We all still live in the same town but it was a fairly large town and it was still hard bumping into people you knew. My family moved houses too and for a while things were calm for me. 
I focused on what I deemed as important, which was getting into a good university and creating a better life for me.
I ended up choosing to attend the State's university which was in the city I lived in and it good because it was closer to home. 
It was there I bumped into Sam again and soon enough, realized we both majored in the same course.
I didn't really feel anything upon seeing her but surprisingly, she wanted to be close. 

She started coming around where I'd hang out and started to go there too and eventually, we just suddenly became ""friends"" again. Neither of us brought up the incident that happened but I was honestly over it. 
I didn't mind being friends with her again but nothing close.
But she had a way of worming her way back into relationships and that's what happened. Eventually we went back to the ""best friends"" title.

That was my first mistake though. 

It had been a while and I'd forgotten about how she was. She became so entitled, narcissistic and hypocritical.
I had begun to work immediately after highschool as a ghostwriter and she always teased me on how dumb it was when she actually relied on her mom and numerous boyfriends for upkeep money. 
It was when she saw the profit I was making from it that she got suddenly interested but then she was horrible at writing and was not willing to take any advice.
 She suddenly began to take offense at any little thing I did, even when I said I was busy because of work and started picking unnecessary fights. 
She wouldn't talk to me for days until apologized and then she'd take her sweet time to forgive me.
All this happened for no good reason. 

I started withdrawing slowly and told her less of things happening in my life and that upset her even more. She began to call me secretive and proud and one time, after finding out I was not in a relationship and still haven't had sex with anyone yet, she made fun of me in front of her other friends. Calling me immature and little. 

All this and my dumb ass remained friends with her, even helping her heal from being used and dumped by random and numerous Aholes she should not even have been dating and once, helping her recover after an abortion that could have killed her. 
She would take me for granted, use me for my money and as some kind of transfer aggression pillow. 
One time, she even tried setting me up to have sex with this random guy, so I can be a ""real woman.""

However the thing that finally ended us happened the beginning of this year. 

I had met my boyfriend, Eren who was two years older and about to graduate, a year and a half ago but started official dating a couple months prior to the new year. 
I didn't tell her because I didn't think there was a reason to.
However, during the Christmas break she apparently saw us together and confronted me during new years, after weeks of ignoring me. 
I was already over her at that point, Eren had told me it would be best to drop someone like her and I agreed. 
She had come storming into my house, calling me a lair and a B word. 
She explained that she considers best friends to be able to tell each other everything and is disappointed that she had to learn things on her own. 
I started laughing when I realized it was all because of my relationship with Eren. I didn't even think she was serious till she ended our friendship and walked out.

I was surprised but honestly didn't care anymore, I was more relieved. I texted Eren what happened and he came over and we talked, together with my Mom and decided that this really was a good thing. 
She didn't talk to me again, even when we began the new semester. 
At that time, Eren graduated and was already working as a paid intern in his uncle's company, coupled with his own little clothing line business. We both had our lives planned out and were very happy and content.

During Valentine's Day, Eren planned with my parents, sisters and friends to throw me a surprise party at which he proposed to me and of course, I accepted. 
I was very happy. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me and the first and only person I'd slept with and believe me, it was all worth it.
We pushed the wedding to later in the year when I'd finish my session, because I needed to focus, the third year was the most difficult.

I hadn't spoken to Sam since so it was a surprise when she came by a few days ago to congratulate me on my engagement, though she didn't look happy in the least. 
I wonder how she knew and realized my sister who has an active social media, posted it on IG. 

I accepted her ""well wishes"" and was about to ask about why she was here when she began talking about plans for my wedding, asking the date so she will start preparing to be my Maid of honor. 
I'm telling you, the shock I had on my face at her audacity.
I stopped her and told her that she was not going to be my MOH because we were not friends in the least. My MOH was going to be my sister.
She began to go on a long tale of how we promised each other that regardless of anything, we would be eachother's MOH when we grew up. She said a lot of things, including saying that I'm way too young or if I know Eren that much to marry him. 
She barely let me get a word in. 
Eventually, I asked her to leave which she did after calling me a bad friend. 

I told Eren and he suggested filing for a restraining order. I wasn't too sure about it so I told him to wait, I didn't think she was dangerous. Well, not like that.

Yesterday, however made me realize my fiance was right.
Yesterday was my engagement party, done according to the customs of where I'm from. It was a little, homely gathering with both families and friends. During the roast however, Sam just walked in.
First of all, I don't know how she got the venue for the place and why she was here.
She immediately started greeting everyone, announcing that the ""MOH of the bride was here."" 
I was becoming so upset and anxious, she sat down and talked about how she was close friends with me and even began to make a toast. It was then that Eren stopped her and asked her to leave. 
She refused, she started to say random incoherent things and I wondered if she was okay mentally.
She started saying I feel like I'm better than her, when I'm not. 
Nonsense like that. 
Eren called security and she struggled, trying to grab me before she was thrown out. 
It was a whole thing and I can't believe that happened.
Today, I'm at home and feeling unsafe to even leave my house. She made a post, calling me horrible things and saying I embarrassed her after inviting her to my engagement party. 

I honestly don't know how to react. The restraining order against her has already been filed.

I honestly feel bad for her and a few people said I shouldn't have let Eren throw her out, that I had indeed embarrassed and humiliated her.

Jealous/toxic mother in law?,"My fiancé and I have been together for almost 8 years. We have two kids together. I have always had a feeling my MIL dislikes me or is somehow jealous of me being with her son. I’m going to only mention the things that she’s said and done. About a year ago she randomly mentioned that she feels like I changed her son. That her son changed when he met me. Mind you this is her ONLY son. I brushed it out because I didn’t want to take it personally. I knew it wasn’t in a good way though. We recently moved in with our in laws which we will be leaving soon. I never have issues with FIL but for some reason Mil is always picking fights for no reason. If my fiancé and her have an argument for some reason she always takes it out on me too. Has a sour face and or ignores me. She works about an hour away and asked to pick her up one day and we did since we were picking up our kids from my moms that day. The whole ride home she was picking fights with my fiancé. Telling him she didn’t want to listen to his sh*tty podcasts. We stopped by Porto’s and she stayed with the babies in the car and when we came back she said she changed my daughter because she was peed and I told her she had a diaper and if it was a lot. She proceeded to tell me if I was calling her a liar? She constantly picks fight with everyone in the house and once she sees how escalated it gets, she tries to calm everyone down. She tells me about how much she would love to spend time with her son, watch a tv show together or anything with her son, then fiancé will proceed to ask her to watch movies or go out to places and she angrily turns him down and says she doesn’t want to? (She told me that he has his own family now and that she realizes she’s not a priority) I feel like she holds alot of resentment.) she persuaded my fiancé to tell me to get an abortion with our first born. (Mind you fiancé and her always had a very close relationship). She’s just always angry and bitter. My fiancé and I broke up years ago and we were co parenting for a while. MIL knew me and him were against Covid vaccine. During an exchange she told me that her son had gotten vaccinated and she was happy he finally did it. Later we got together and I found out she lied. I feel like she thinks I stole him from her. I have been nothing but good to her. I’m honestly done trying to have a good relationship with her. She’s ruining my mental peace . This is just a few things she’s done. Am I exaggerating ? Or does she sound toxic?

I confronted her and she lied and said she wouldn’t do that. The day we picked her and went to Porto’s up I put some things in the trunk. She bought her coffee machine with her and when we got home she saw some piece was missing. She said it must have been me when I opened the trunk. After 5 hrs in the car and having her start fights with fiancé, I raised my voice alittle and told her I didn’t drop anything!!

I had the dumbest argument with my Christian family ,"So my mom and this family friend are both crazy Christian nut jobs. I went to visit my grandma on Sunday and they both were there.

I shit you not they agreed that if god knows the future then you can’t change it and then said that you still have free will. Then the family friend fought with me over a verse that says “predestined” in it saying it didn’t mean no free will. I was shocked and told him that that’s what predestined means, no free will.

the only wrong answer,,1b1jp21,0,66,https://i.redd.it/hv41i8npc6lc1.jpeg,"['lol who TF made you gatekeeper of legitimate libertarian takes? First off who TF “likes” abortions answer almost no one but sick people. However, there is a significant faction that “likes” the choice. Choice is kinda like freedom, which is kinda a key notion for libertarians. I understand that freedom extends to the limit where it interferes with another’s personal freedoms. Abortion is a complicated issue, that’s why there are multiple opinions. I wouldn’t say any of them are definitively right or wrong (within reason). Personally I find abortions abominable, but I’m not going to purposefully limit another individual body autonomy and sure as shit don’t think the government should(because when has it ever been a libertarian take that government regulation is a good thing…) . Obviously this all comes back to when a collection of cells becomes a “human” with its own rights and protection of its body autonomy. For me that line is the 1st trimester, for others it’s from conception, for some it is minutes before birth. I’m not going to say definitively one is correct. At the end of the day it’s not really my choice or about me though. Imagine if most gun control policy was passed and enforced by non-gun owners. It would probably result in ridiculous control and heavy government regulation. I see the same limitations when it comes to abortion, the policy is often decided by old men with no horse in the race. That’s one of the reasons I disagree with leaving this decision down to policy makers rather than the potential mothers it impacts.

But you're really a Republican that likes to smoke weed."", ""The level of retardation involved in admitting you don't like abortions while also trying to insist the government has no role to play in whether or not they happen is off the fucking charts."", "" \n\nIf you don't like abortions, it's because you believe it's the ending of a human life, otherwise you're just a misogynistic asshole who thinks women shouldn't be allowed to do what they want with a clump of cells.

MA- Ectopic pregnancy risk,"Hi, I found out I was pregnant last week and ordered the pills to my house. I got an ultrasound done earlier this week, but it was way too early to tell anything (under 4 weeks). I just took the first pill yesterday and am about to take the remaining 4 today. 

However, I was going through this thread and am kind of worried about wether or not I have an ectopic pregnancy.  I read that having pcos increases your chances, and I do have pcos. 

I already took the first pill though. Should i just continue on with it? How likely am i to have an ectopic pregnancy? I haven’t had any symptoms or any bleeding, but I am scared it might be ectopic bc of my PCOS. I don’t want to waste these pills because it was a process getting them, but I don’t want to bleed out. Should i worry about ectopic or just continue the process?

Tips to abort a Bad Trip,"I have read a few things that can reduce the psychs effect to cancel the trip when it's becoming unpleasant. Not instant, but it's something.

\- Have some benzodiazepine (Xanax or Valium).

\- Eat something or have some sugar drink.

\- Focus on your breathe. This doesnt cancel the trip, but many said this helps to shift bad trips into good ones. 

\- Distract your mind watching videos on youtube or some movie (I guess you must be careful what kind of videos you watch as well).

How do I stop being so angry?,"I got diagnosed with ghsv2 about 2 weeks ago and my first outbreak is still healing. I keep going back and forth between accepting this as it is and getting revenge on the person who gave it to me. Now that it doesn’t hurt as badly anymore my initial reactions have calmed down but everytime I feel a nerve pain in my foot or my healing sore stinging I’m reminded like it’s the first time all over again. 

Honestly, when it doesn’t hurt I can see myself being able to go on with my life as normal. I don’t see myself having sex for a long time, but I’m still able to feel happy despite having an incurable sti (cuz that’s what it is folks— not just a skin condition but something that will never go away). I still feel like “me”, and in a lot of ways it made me start caring about myself even more. Staying healthy will give me a lower chance for new outbreaks so I’m exercising more and eating healthier. I can see myself going on with my life.

But I’m so angry at the man who have this to me then ghosted like a coward. I want to be violent, I want to show up at his house and trash his car, I want to message his mom and tell her how much of a bitch she raised. I’m so mad at him and myself. Having sex you always risk either stis or pregnancy and I’d rather abort his baby than be stuck with this. I’m trying to see the positives but I just feel so idiotic letting this happen.

The Auntie Network Helped Me So Much - I am Forever Grateful,"So a few years ago I was in bad situation- literally right before they overturned roe wade and made abortion illegal in my state.

I had a medical diagnoses of an unviable fetus, and STILL couldnt get care- and I literally have access to more resources than a LOT of people. It was honestly the most helpless terrifying feeling Ive ever experienced.

And when I didn’t, they said I might die, but would not help. Eventually, after extreme fighting on our part,  they sent me out of state. I think the fourth doctor I saw finally helped me. I would not wish the hell I went through on anyone in any circumstances.   \n\n\nI am not trying to make this about me, at all.

I feel like I’m trapped,"I debated whether or not to post anything because the fear of being ‘found out’ is always creeping up behind me. But I think I need to reach out for support regardless of that. Here’s my story:

I grew up in a typical evangelical background, though slightly ‘diverse’ as my family and I church-hopped a lot and I experienced a few different denominations. Ultimately we landed on a non-denominational (aka baptist but afraid to say they are) church when I was 14 and have been there ever since. I loved my church. The community, the worship, the pastor. Everything felt so right to me.

Then I went to college.

Mind you, I still went to a Christian college, but this one was very open to discourse between denominations and encouraged intellectual conversation. I had the chance to hear the perspectives of people from different sects of Christianity, people who weren’t Christian, international students who didn’t grow up with the Western mindset, and more. This is when I started to deconstruct, little by little.

Then I travelled abroad. 

My spring semester of freshman year I got to study abroad and that opened a flood gate of questions. The program I was in focused on the evolution of the Western mindset from ancient Greco-Roman times all the way up through modernity. I studied the progression of culture, literature, art, music, philosophy, and religion in the Western world and had to write a paper every week about it. It was an incredible course, but it opened up Pandora’s box in my mind.

I left that academic year with brand new eyes, and subsequently an existential crisis of sorts. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. 

My first battle with deconstruction was a common one. I had started to question the inerrancy of the Bible due to the fact that I could not understand why homosexuality was wrong. I became close friends with gay Christians at my school and refused to believe they had to suffer for eternity because of something that wasn’t a choice for them. Once I decided that the Bible was probably mistranslated in ‘those’ passages, I packaged up my grievances and put them in the back of my head. I even dated a bisexual Christian for the first time.

Fast forward, COVID hit. Suddenly I’m being sent home in my final semester of college because of the pandemic. No graduation for me. I was isolated, I was scared, and I missed my college community dearly. Then the social justice movements started to pick up speed. I found myself passionate about BLM and I wanted to see how my church would respond. To my delight, my pastor elevated the black voices in our church and spoke out against the evil and sin of racism. People left our church because of it, saying that the pastor didn’t defend the congregants who were in law enforcement. He didn’t back down, which I respected him for. It gave me a deeper trust in my church. I decided once we reopened, I was gonna go back and serve on the worship team liked I used to.

What a mistake.

At the time that I had rejoined the worship team, I was good friends with a coworker who I was secretly in love with. He was agnostic at best and didn’t grow up religious at all, but his character and values were better than most Christians I knew. Before long, we confessed our love for each other. As thrilling as it was, I was deeply convicted about falling for a non-Christian. I tried evangelizing him while also not being too pushy, but it didn’t work. I said cringey stuff like “if i truly love you then I must care about your salvation.” (I get shivers when I think about it). After months of the back in forth of “I love you but we can’t date” I decided that I had to cut off ties with him because I didn’t want to be ‘unequally yoked’ and date him, but being just friends was too hard. This sent me spiraling downwards. 

That following summer (2021), I questioned everything. I was so mad at God. How could this happen? How could I find the perfect person for me but he wasn’t a Christian? How unfair! I wrestled a lot. After a while I calmed down and shoved my feelings in a box and went about my business. I was in denial.

During this time (I call it the Dark Ages), I became friends with this girl on the worship team. We watched in real time our pastor become more and more red-pilled with each passing week. He preached sermons on homosexuality, abortion, female pastors, “progressive Christianity,” condemning it all. We sat in service many times looking at each other and wincing. One time she actually got up and left mid-service because she couldn’t listen to it anymore. Our beloved pastor who used to preach these amazing in depth reads of different books of the Bible was switching to a topical approach that was totally influenced by our shifting culture. It was devastating to us. 

In the midst of all this, my friend recommended I listen to The Bible for Normal People podcast. She said it had helped her sort through some of the wreckage that our pastor caused. I gave it a listen and fell in love. Pete Enns became my hero. This led me to take a deeper look into biblical scholarship. I started following another hero of mine, Dan McClellan, on TikTok, and my mind proceeded to be blown at every video and soundbyte I watched and listened to. I added Rachel Held Evans to my list of deconstruction heroes and I found solace in this “unholy” trinity. Honorable mention goes to Aaron Higashi.

Unfortunately, this gave me some INTENSE cognitive dissonance every time I listened to my pastor preach. It still does. He’s aware of the deconstruction and progressive Christianity movement and has found ways to “debunk” it with scripture, never failing to make me feel guilty every time he explains why it’s wrong and “false teaching.”

Despite my dislike for the sermons, I still loved my church. I actually wound up taking a job there. Another mistake.

Fast forward to late 2022, my brain can no longer compartmentalize and I realize that almost two years later I’m still in love with the friend I cut ties with. At this point, I had deconstructed enough to be willing to try dating a non-Christian. I even bargained with God by saying “if he is the one, bring him back into my life.” I reached out not knowing what would become of it, truly afraid of being rejected after what I did. To my surprise he was willing to reconnect. God answered my prayer. Perhaps.

Fast forward again, early 2023, we decided to date. At this point, I had told him about my spiritual journey and where I was at. He was thrilled that I had done so much work to get rid of the junk I had been brought up with. Though he wasn’t a Christian, he supported my decision to remain one. We decided to see a counselor together (a lady from my church) who helped us navigate our differences in spirituality. I felt confident that this could work out. 

Until one day I realized that I secretly was hoping my boyfriend would become a Christian.

I felt like a fraud. But in my defense, it was difficult to genuinely be okay with our differences when my friends and family kept saying stuff like “we pray every day for his salvation.” My aunt even put a tract in my boyfriend’s Christmas card (which we honestly just laughed about). I decided to have a conversation with him about it. As always, he was understanding, but still very comfortable in his agnosticism. He said “well maybe I’m not supposed to be a Christian. Maybe I’m supposed to give you another perspective, and you do the same for me.” I simultaneously loved and hated that answer. I loved it because I agreed that it was a good dynamic to have. I hated it because it would be easier if he was a Christian so my evangelical trauma of thinking he was going to hell would finally leave me alone. Alas, even today we are still in the same place.

Now I’m in a position where I’m deeply conflicted about everything. I hate my job and want to leave, but can’t seem to get another job. I love my community but also feel a disconnect because of our opposing views. I can’t stand to listen to my pastor preach anymore because now I’m constantly feeling triggered. I wish I could run away and find another church but at the same time I don’t know if I want to go to church anymore. I still wish my bf would become a Christian but at the same time I don’t even know if I am one anymore. Every day I jump back in forth between wanting to keep my faith and wanting to lose it. I feel like I don’t belong in any social group. I feel different from my Christian friends but also different from my non-Christian friends. I feel like a misfit. I wish my bf could relate to me because it’s so hard to be alone in this. I know I have an online community but sometimes that isn’t enough and I want a real person in front of me. My friend that had helped my deconstruction journey moved away and we don’t talk as much anymore. Every day I get the thought in my mind “what if I’m wrong and I’m going to hell?” It’s a terrible feeling. Every day I miss being in college, when life was simpler. 

Sigh. When will it end? I don’t regret my deconstruction because I finally have reached a place of honesty with myself. I still love Jesus and his teachings but I cannot say with any certainty that he is God and that he resurrected from the dead. I constantly wonder if that makes me a heretic. My pastor is currently preaching from the book of revelation and every Sunday I feel like my head is going to explode. I’m at my wit’s end with everything, and I’m afraid there is no answer that is going to save me from my dilemma. 

Sorry this was so long. I’ve kept a lot of this inside for a long time. I would appreciate any input, whether you’re still a Christian or you left Christianity. I know you all understand my pain to some extent. Thanks <3

Very painful. \n\nHave you checked into any progressive churches?  Sorry if I missed that in your post.', ""Wow, that is a very difficult position that you are in, with a lot of conflicting pressures that are bearing down heavily on you it seems. Living in a state of cognitive dissonance like that is exhausting. Thank you for bravely sharing your story with us.\n\nSo many of us have been through similar situations, so maybe there is some comfort in knowing that others are/have been there and found a way through it. You will also, but it will absolutely be a pivot point in your life. When I realized that my faith was gone, it changed a lot of things about my life. Fortunately my paid job at the church was a side thing and not my primary source of income, so I could separate from that a bit easier.\n\nOne of the biggest powers of religion is in keeping us conformed to the community. Losing your community can be very scary, but you WILL find/create a new one, and I think you will find that many of your friendships will survive this with you. I lost some friends, kept many and gained new ones. It took me a while to figure out how to build a new community, but I have a few great ones now. \n\nWhen will it end? Heavy sigh. It's been 11 years for me, and sometimes it still feels raw. There are things I miss about that part of my life, but to go back would be like deciding to believe in Santa Claus again. I know he doesn't exist, and I would be faking it to fit in. I'm not able to do that; I value authenticity far too much.\n\nYou are not a miss-fit, you are simply in a transitional time in your life. You will be fine, either way, as you decide what you are comfortable with. I would highly recommend that you stay true to yourself, and not live to please other people. It's a difficult thing to do coming from a religion that pounds into you that living for yourself is the worst evil there is... \n\nYou got this. You are strong enough."", ""Thanks for sharing!!! \n\nWhat you're feeling is very normal. What I've discovered about what it means to follow the Jesus of the bible is that it's super uncomfortable, but not for the reasons I thought.\n\nThe biggest reason being that his path is almost diametrically opposed to the majority of what's being taught in today's christianity, so that means that it will feel very lonely. The majority of christianity now is simply a country club made to make its congregants feel good and warm inside, to get them to open their wallets so that the structure can acquire wealth, power and influence. Meanwhile people are slowly red-pilled into an increasingly cold hearted mentality, to the point where they've lost all integrity, truth and discernment.\n\nSo I would suggest taking a break, clearing your head, build friendships outside of the bubble, and definitely continue to pursue truth and clarity."", 'I am so sorry for the pain and confusion you’re going through.

I’m doing better every day but it’s still a struggle. I was so programmed about hell and eternity and representing Christ and honoring my parents until I began to see how every part of it comes down to control tactics and circular reasoning. \n\nTruthfully, I had the independent thought once, just a concept, “self-resonance.”\n\nIt was the opposite of the life of cognitive dissonance I lived with because of holding on to other people’s beliefs.\n\nOnce I had that thought, it’s been like an addiction.

He can keep their company.', 'I resonate with a lot of specific elements of your story. Sitting through sermons and feeling your skin crawl - the post COVID church dissonance, pushing through the dissonance to experience ""loving community"" - then feeling somewhat abandoned by parts of that community when I tried to engage in good-faith (no pun intended) discussions about the problems I\'m seeing.\n\nPodcasts helped give me language and validated that there are more ways to experience faith than just fundamentalism, and even gave me role models (especially the Bible For Normal People!) to emulate who were also genuinely humble. \n\nI felt like a weight had been lifted when I stopped attending my Evangelical Church. I miss the people... sort of. But by the time I left, I was so done with the language they used, the worship services that felt like meaningless changing, and all the ""love"" that felt like it was just a cover to justify exclusion and self-righteousness. Sorry - my cynicism gets the better of me sometimes.\n\nI\'ve been deconstructing since college as well, but only really had the language for it in the last year, and only started really deconstructing ""church attendance"" and ""personal prayer"" in the past few months. I met with the rector at my Episcopal church (bump for that group by the way, I\'ve enjoyed it) and laid out my whole story. He listened, validated, and asked thoughtful questions instead of trying to tell me what to believe or quoting Scripture at me. \n\nRegarding church attendance, and what I most resonated with in your story, I liked how he worded it: ""Sunday morning should be an open invitation to come and worship, not a requirement. If you don\'t attend, you\'ll be missed because of what your presence brings, but you won\'t be judged, because that\'s not the reason we are gathering."" \n\nIt felt so freeing to hear that from a pastor, of all people. So I skipped church this past Sunday. I stayed home and painted miniatures, and drank coffee. And it was... nice. Not blissful, not holy, but... nice. Restful. I haven\'t felt really rested on a Sunday morning in a long time. \n\nI really don\'t want to just give you advice, the last thing I have wanted through most of my process is someone telling me what to do. And it sounds like you already are making this move, pending a job change but yeah... you gotta get out of that church. :/ I physically cringed reading your post at some of the things your pastor is preaching on. I can\'t imagine sitting through another sermon like that, ever again. \n\nOne word of encouragement, something that\'s given me comfort and I\'ve shared with others in my life. God, if he is real, is not worried about you. If the God of the bible is real, then he\'s not sitting there, finger hovering over the \'smite\' key just waiting for you to figure this faith business out. IF that God is real, then he\'s lovingly watching us try to figure this thing called life out. Still a lot of ""if\'s"" - but if God is real, then I believe he\'s okay with that too. \n\nI hope you can soon find some rest, peace, and encouragement from people who really know your story and really care about you. Sounds like this person you\'re dating is a great example of that. Peace!', 'I remember reading somewhere- may have been Cindy Wang Brandt but someone might put me right:\xa0 ""If the cost of belonging to a community is the loss of your authenticity it\'s too high a cost.""\xa0 I can completely relate to the feeling of flipping and compartmentalizing. You can sort of feel split between two worlds, and understand them both and not yet feel ready to fully commit to one of them. It\'s hard, really hard, but I think it\'s all part of the process. If you can allow and accept this alternation and not condemn it within yourself it may help.\xa0\n\n\nIt\'s ok to leave your church if it\'s painful to keep going there.\xa0\n\n\nOoh, one book that comes to mind- Sarah Bessey\'s Field Notes for the Wilderness.', 'Religious indoctrination like evangelicalism is abuse. It sounds like you still have more deconstructing to do. I hope you do it sooner rather than later so you can keep your amazing partner (and he truly does sound like an amazing person).\n\nYour cognitive dissonance is probably a result of you still exposing yourself to the brainwashing and conditioning of the abusive church. It\'s abuse because it forces you to completely suppress and reject your truest Self and doesn\'t allow you to follow your intellect and heart (yes, both) and live in full integrity.\n\nHonestly, you\'re almost there. If you can find a way to truly let go I think you\'ll find freedom on the other side. If you need a little more push, read up well on the history of evangelical christianity. It is responsible for so much bad stuff from controlling U.S. textbooks (how slavery, evolution, and now climate change are taught) to controlling policy and people who aren\'t part of their religion. It\'s authoritarianism, simply put. And btw, the whole Jesus born again theme is new. That wasn\'t even a thing with original Christianity (the evangelism part of evangelical christianity).\n\nThe goal is to keep you doubting what you already seem to know in your heart. Yes, you\'ll have to grieve the truth of all this. But as someone with a very similar background (but was a young adult in the 90s), the most authentic joy and rewarding relationships await you on the other side of grief and acceptance. Letting go is hard. But if you don\'t at this point, you could spend an entire lifetime in limbo, questioning. You don\'t have to give up God or even Jesus, but there are so many other ways to frame and think about God and Jesus that are inclusive and not in conflict w/ other religions which essentially all attempt to teach similar truths.\n\nedit to add: There are churches like UU (Unitarian Universalist) that study all religions respectfully, including Christianity, without forcing literal belief into any you don\'t want to. They even include paganism. I\'ve found that to meet my intellectual and spiritual needs because it\'s not dogmatic (doesn\'t deny or affirm God\'s literal existence). And who\'s to say ""god"" isn\'t a woman or, maybe neither male or female?', 'I had a wonderful experience at a UU church . It was the last church in my deconstruction journey. Being raised Pentecostal, I first tried Baptist, then Methodist and finally UU. I was always looking for something more open minded. You had to be Pentecostal and Republican in my family to be a good person. The condemnation and disapproval is difficult. And now I think my family is very cult like. I’m stressed about being with distant relatives next week that will assume that I am a Trumper, homophobic, racist, etc., I squirm in my seat and more than once have had to make a proclamation. Once you come out, you’re looked at as a failure and hell bound. After the Trump movement, I decided I wouldn’t pretend I’m a Christian anymore. I don’t want that label. All of the guilt that you experience as you deconstruct, for me, is because I’ve left a cult. It’s such a brainwashing. I no longer feel guilty about not being in church on Sundays. It’s so freeing. For me, once I started  questioning and seeing, there was no turning back. I do so many things that were forbidden to me in the past, but so positive. I’m so glad we have this place to vent and question. I know that there are so many like me and you.']"
WIBTA if I get an abortion after what my boyfriend did?,"


Hello I am (25F), I'm 7 weeks pregnant with my first child. I thought I was having a baby with a good man but comes to find out everything was a lie. I work as a real estate agent and my boyfriend (27M) works in a windows company.


Yesterday while I was at my mother's house I got a call from the county jail, I was confused because I never got a call from a jail but stupid me answered it. To my shock it wasy boyfriend at the end of the phone, I was pissed because I wanted to know what he did. My boyfriend was charged with 1st degree burglary and assault , I haven't gotten anymore information yet but if I do I will update you guys. And no I don't want to be with him anymore, I told him I was through with him but he said we're never breaking up which scared me. 


I'm having second guesses about having this baby because they won't have a father in their life and I will be a single mother. I doubt myself because what if I can't take care of a child? I don't want my child to having a criminal father because no child deserves that, I didn't tell him about the abortion because I know he would be upset so I'm not saying a word to him. I toldy mother how I was feeling about this and she is mad with me but she is still helping me out.  I never knew my life would be like this, all I wanted was to get married to a good man and have kids but nothing seems to work for me.



Edited: I see everyone saying I need more details and it's exactly what I said in the post. He was charged because he was caught breaking into someones house, the house is ,2 blocks from me so that's how close he was. He then assaulted the home owner so basically a home invasion,I don't have anymore information and I just got what the cops told me. What I heard was that one of the neighbors called those cops because they heard disturbance in the homeowners house. He was caught on camera from different angles so he has no way out. And I didn't mention this before but he's been in there for 3 days and I know I took this long to find out more information and I am sorry. I have no more information but if I get more from the department I will update!

My abortion story.. if It can help other women.. ,"I am writing this in the hopes to tell other women. I am 37 (as of Dec 2023) and have been a mother since I was 19. I’ve had 5 c-sections in totality. Keep in mind as you read this novel I’m writing that the complications can be due to anything and every woman is different and responds differently to the medications. I. Dec 2023- I had my period. Jan 2024 comes. My period is late. Pregnancy is the last thing I expected as my periods aren’t exactly regular. We got to about a week and a half late and I decided to grab a $1.00 test from the closest dollar tree. It was around 3PM and it is usually requested per the directions that the test be taken first thing in the morning. Well, I couldn’t wait. So I took it as soon as my husband and I arrived home. The positive line came up extremely fast and very strong. I was floored. Speechless. I started immediately trying to think of solutions as we live in a southern state so there are not many options here. I can’t say where. After a lot of research I arrived at the choice of abortion through medication.  I ordered the medicine. It arrived in a regular USPS box. I ordered on a Friday and it arrived Monday afternoon when the mail ran. I took the first one that Monday. 36 hours later I inserted 4 of the 2nd medicine inside of me. I felt the closer to my cervix the better. Inserting them vs putting them under your tongue will avoid the nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. You know when you have a water balloon and it just burst, that’s what it felt like happened. It requires you to lay down for 30 minutes and it had only been 10-15 minutes so I had my husband run and grab a towel for me to lay on. After 30 mins had passed I went to use the restroom and get myself cleaned up because there was blood everywhere. Something came out. I wasn’t sure what it was or what I was looking for. I now believe it was the mucus plug. After I got cleaned up. I went to bed. When I woke up in the morning the instant I sat up I had to run to the bathroom. I started gushing blood. I had terrible pain. I’m not sure why the pain took so long to come. Probably because I layed back down. But my husband took off to get our other children ready for school and help me out that day. I had lots of bleeding and plenty of blood clots. I didn’t even know they were clots at first. Like I said. No idea what I’m supposed to be looking for as I was only 6 weeks pregnant at the time. After 3 days the bleeding finally slowed down. That slow bleed lasted about 3 days. Then all of a sudden. Another water balloon gush. I couldn’t even get off the toilet. I tried folding a shirt over 4-6 times to sit on. I soaked through that. I was soaking an over night pad within 30 mins. It was insane. But I assumed it was part of the process & contacted the doctor to be safe. They assured me it was normal. Again the bleeding slowed and 3-4 days later. Another huge gush. Like it would build up and then let it out. This went on for 12 days. I finally went to the emergency room. Only because I was in so much pain it felt like I was about to give birth. We waited 12 hours. The pain had gone away and the bleeding slowed. So I signed myself out because 12 hours and not even seeing a doctor yet. Time to go. When the gush happened again we decided to go back to the ER. I’m mixed. And my skin was extremely pale. My lips had no color. I was getting extremely dizzy all the time, and felt sick to my stomach to where I couldn’t eat anything. They admitted me. I couldn’t tell them about the medication. The only thing I could tell them is that I did not want the baby anyways as harsh as that may have sounded. By this time I’m 9 weeks pregnant. In the hospital I continued to lose a ton of blood over 4 days. They’d give me a transfusion and I’d just lose more. It was an endless cycle. They finally decided to do a d&c because without it. I would die. During the d&c they couldn’t get my uterus to stop bleeding. So they inserted a “balloon”. It puts pressure on something bleeding internally to try to make it stop. If that did not work. The only option left was hysterectomy. Taking my uterus out. Thankfully the balloon seems to have worked. When I contacted the doctor and told them what all happened I was furious. Because they said “you don’t need to go back to the hospital” and had I listened. I’d not be alive. They then tell me that 4% of people hemorrhage. They couldn’t tell me why after taking the medicine that the baby’s heartbeat was 160 and my HCG levels were 111,000. All normal. But shouldn’t have been. My advice is if you’re in a state that has very limited options. You travel to a center. Ask questions etc. idk if this is an unusual case or not. But I know I almost didn’t make it through it. And that’s scary. Women should have SAFE options period. Shame on our government for taking those safe options away.

Could my partner go to prison??,"I tried to kill myself within the last year. Very long story short, I lashed out bc i had pent up rage and an incredibly distorted view of myself (i’m in intense therapy right now so i’m learning how i got there). And the way in which i lashed out really hurt my partner and i feel horrible for doing everything i had done. When they found everything out and confronted me they were livid. I asked if there was anything i could do to make them feel better and they told me to legitimately kill myself. So i tried. They almost immediately tried texting me to get me to come back but by then i turned my phone off and was determined. For a little bit of context, my partner knows my life long history of depression and suicidal ideation. I’ve had 5+ self aborted attempts and a few were thwarted by my partner themself years ago. What i’m trying to find out is if I come to a therapist with this will my partner get in trouble??? Also would it be risky to bring up in group therapy?? I feel it’s also important to mention we have children together and are all living together. I also want to be clear that they made it abundantly clear that they didn’t actually want me to do it and they felt horrible and responsible for my attempt. I can’t get it out of my head though. Every time i start catastrophising it becomes such a strong piece of “evidence” that i should just end my life. My partner told me if I needed to bring it up for treatment and to get better that i should but then said under their breath that they would probably get in legal trouble. I looked it up and telling someone to kill themselves is a felony. Idk what to do. It’s eating away at me but i don’t want them to get in trouble cuz i don’t want to do that to our kids.

Do I address the therapist who I felt judged me for having an abortion due to non-viability?,"Last year I terminated a very wanted pregnancy due to a suspected partial molar pregnancy and my doctors advice that regardless of the specific diagnosis, this would not be a healthy pregnancy. I chose to have the termination knowing I could get more testing before or after the termination and I was incredibly sick so I chose to have the abortion sooner and then test the cells to find it what happened.  Also, I never did get a specific diagnosis due to the sample spilling on the way to the lab which is another thing but also heartbreaking. 

After the termination I was sick with grief. This was something I've dreamed of my whole life and tried for months to get pregnant. I sought out a therapist who specialized in pregnancy loss. In some ways she was helpful but I had a few issues. She got into pregnancy loss therapy due to her own losses which were miscarriages. I was concerned that maybe she saw my choice as wrong because maybe she would have chosen to keep the pregnancy until it ended in it's own. Because I didn't have reason to think this, I let it go. There were two incidents that caused me to stop working with her and I would like your opinion. 

1. In a moment of intense grief I said I worried that because I terminated before getting a conclusive diagnosis, maybe I would be a bad mother since I didn't fight for my baby. I do not think this is true outside of that day but I was really hurting. She listened and never responded and basically changed the subject. I felt that she agreed with this horrible thought. 

2. She asked in my third session whether I regretted my choice. I told her my main feeling was not regret. I was sad, jealous of others, felt a lack of control but that I did not see what other options I really had. She seemed surprised. She said that I seemed to be resistant to admitting that I felt regret and asked me why that might be. I told her I don't think I'm being resistant, I just don't think that regret was what I was feeling or the most distressing emotion. I felt like that she was saying that I should be feeling regret and she thought I should regret my choice. 

I cancelled my appointments after that because I felt I could no longer be vulnerable with her. Regardless of what she thought, I felt judged. That was about 9 months ago. I have worked with other therapists and my doctor and all have had more appropriate responses to my grief (IMO). They have helped me deal with the emotions and get through the worst of it. They told me that I was in an awful situation and I made the best choice I could with the information I had. That the doctors had no hope of a healthy pregnancy and I used that information to make a tough call. No one else insisted or even implied I should be feeling regret. I also have never had any therapist insist I was feeling an emotion if I said I wasn't. I think I'm relatively emotionally intelligent and I have never had a hard time identifying and explaining my emotions. 

Yesterday I saw an article about her and her family in the local newsletter. It emphasized multiple times how she grew up Christian and how important Christianity was. This made me feel again that maybe I was right to believe she did not approve of my choice due to her faith. 

I know that I could be projecting my thoughts onto her but I really felt her insistence that I was feeling regret was not appropriate.  In the months since I have considered posting about my experience on Yelp/Google because I worry about other women who have had terminations for medical reasons going to her and having this experience. I also wrote an email I haven't sent her saying why I stopped going to her. I want her to know how she came across in case she does actually support the decision I made and it just came out wrong. I also said that if she is pro life then maybe she shouldn't work with people who had terminations or at least disclose her beliefs on her website. She owns the practice in case that matters.

I'm curious what other therapists think. Should I send her an email? Do you think this was actually inappropriate or just me being sensitive about a tough issue? Maybe a case of us just not connecting? Thank you for reading and for your feedback. ",1b1hugu,5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/askatherapist/comments/1b1hugu/do_i_address_the_therapist_who_i_felt_judged_me/,"['I think she was inappropriate in how she responded to you in some ways.\n\nHer saying nothing when you said you felt you would be a bad mother… I think in that moment, it was okay to not say anything and to let that thought hang for a bit before moving on. It’s tricky as as a human being I would desperately want to say ‘you sound like you would be a wonderful mother’ or ‘you are a wonderful mother to the baby you sadly lost’, but I’m aware my opinion isn’t relevant, and by saying that I could be shutting down my client’s own perception of the situation, which is so valid!\n\nBut the latter… was inappropriate. She was possibly mapping her own feelings onto you, that you didn’t share. Or she has sat with so many clients wracked with regret, she was unable to treat you like your own person and not a copy of every other client she’s had. By insisting you were resistant to feeling an emotion you didn’t tell her you felt, that was invalidating and comes across much more like she thought you should feel regret. If she felt you did experience regret but couldn’t express it, there are way more sensitive ways to explore this. Off the top of my head… maybe saying how some people feel a sense of regret even when they know it was the right thing to do. Is that something you’ve ever experienced? But telling you you are resistant to ‘admit’ you felt regret and asking why that is? Just feels super judgy to me. Even the word ‘admit’ leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She didn’t meet you where you were at there, and she didn’t seem to recognise that her own feelings aren’t necessarily how someone else would feel. I guess we all have our blind spots in therapy but I’d be heartbroken if I’d caused a client to feel the way you do through my words. And putting myself in your shoes, I would be actually pretty angry at a therapist who told me how they thought I should be feeling about something and then asked me why I thought I was resistant to admitting it, as if they know me better than I know myself.\n\nAs to where you go from here, it truly depends on the outcome you want. If you contact her to discuss this, what would happen if she replied and listened and apologised and said she would take the feedback on board? What would happen if she doubles down and tells you that didn’t happen, or that you misunderstood, or that she was right to say it? What would happen if she never replied at all? \n\nPersonally, I would be tempted to go down the route of leaving an honest, balanced review online, and then if she wanted to reach out I would be open to hearing what she had to say. If I felt able to. I’d probably say something about what was helpful about the therapy, but also what wasn’t (feeling like the therapist struggled to hear where you were at emotionally and feeling invalidated by her insistence that you were feeling something you weren’t). And probably a 2-3 stars lol. If you genuinely felt it was worth that. An honest, balanced, calm review with a mediocre/low score will show people viewing it that it’s a thoughtful review rather than someone who’s angry or upset for no reason just lashing out online. \n\nOnly you know what’s best for you. I’m so, so sorry for your loss. I can feel how much you wanted your baby, and what a wonderful mother you were to them, to take a very painful step for you to ensure they didn’t suffer.', 'This is quite grey so I want to say two things.\n\nThe way she responded and questioned clearly didn’t mesh well with where you are and your feelings, experiences, and thoughts. I think she did badly but didn’t quite cross the line. I think it’s fair to wonder if she was judging but I hope that it doesn’t put you into a place of shame.\n\nYou were put in one of those impossible positions in life where you found out something you had longed for was incompatible with life - and the beautiful life you had imagined. I am so very sorry. Terminations for medical reasons are form of baby loss that is less known about and I hope that this therapist learns more to be better able to respond in future. You lost your loved and wanted baby. You made an impossible choice and I see you. I see your grief and I hope for a better world where we can lose the taboo around all kinds of baby loss. I am so sorry that you were made to feel this way at such a difficult time. R/ttcafterloss and r/pregnancyafterloss and two very supportive places where you might see other people who understand if andor when you want them.\n\n\nTherapists should see where their clients and respond with love rather than judgement. Clients should be able to feel that they are in a place safe from judgement or they are at risk of further harm.', 'I see nothing wrong with sending her the email. She can choose to disregard it or seriously think about what you’re saying and that could possibly change how she practices therapy.', ""I think the feedback you have to give is really important. It sounds like a very vulnerable experience.\n\n\\#2 seems like it could be an expectation that all clients have similar feelings, or maybe she's had a lot of clients who have a hard time admitting regret."", 'Do you want an email response or just to tell her? Include that in the email.\n\nI would vote to send it. As a supposed expert she needs to hear this feedback. For future clients please send it.', '[deleted]']"
HCBM lying to Stepkids,"My husband has 3 little girls and together, we have six kids. We’ve been married for 2 years. His ex wife and HCBM had been telling their kids (8,9,11) so many lies about him and I both. She’s told them that he destroyed their family and that’s why they don’t get to live with their mom and dad. That he’s a horrible father, horrible man and a “compulsive liar.” She tells them that he’s broke? That he’s never there for them and that she’s going to make sure they never have to go here again. Back story: they were married 8 years. She had several affairs. He tried to make it work for their girls, however he filed for divorce after she had another affair and had to tell him because she got an STD. 2 weeks after finalizing their divorce, she dropped the girls off to him and said she couldn’t be a mom right now. That she wanted to “learn who she was.” So, she willingly signed over her custody. She was only seeing them every other weekend and then she decided to take him back to court. She has called DHS on him twice (obviously never went anywhere.) she has made a million posts online about him, trying to trash him. She ended up moving out of town because everyone started defending him. Now everyone in this town is “trashy” (which she tells the girls.) When he met me, we got engaged and eventually married and had a baby, she freaked out. She begged him to not be with me. Asked him “how could you get married again?!” And cried on voicemails about him having a child with his wife….She told the girls that he would never find better than her, that I’m a whore, that I was using him, that I’m a bad mom. That I am jealous of her and insecure. And the list goes on. Lol. The girls have all asked if they could live with us. Their mom lives with two men, one of who she has a baby with but they are not together. They have stated several times that they are tired of going there. They said their mom is basically a “baby sitter.” And that she’s always gone. They stated this past week that there  are many times that she comes home and says she doesn’t want to see them and goes to her room. 

So, my question is: We have kept our mouths shut to the girls about their moms’ lies for the last two years. We’ve let her run her mouth and stood on the belief that the truth will come out one day. However, it hit a breaking point when one of the girls were crying saying that their dad destroyed their life because their mom said it. So he sat them down and told them the truth. I hate this situation because I feel like the truth was needed but it shouldn’t be a conversation that was necessary. She won’t keep her opinions to herself and trauma dumps on the kids. One example is her telling their oldest daughter that her grandma begged her to abort her.. the 11 year old was upset about this and we were livid that she would tell a child that. Was it wrong for us to finally tell the truth? He had to explain that she was “seeing other boys while married to me” and things like that. I think he’s just tired of being the bad guy. Also worth mentioning that she pays for nothing, does not show up to doctors appointments, games, practices. Etc. In two years, I’ve went to every parent teacher conference and she’s never showed up to a single one. He still has primary custody of the girls BTW.

I really need advice/encouragement ,"I (30F) found out I'm about 7 weeks pregnant with my third child. The pregnancy is not planned but was a welcomed surprised. I say ""was"" because my announcement to my husband (34M) went completely different than I hoped. I surprised him with the home test and a sweet card during dinner on Valentine's Day and his face went pale before he said... "" Well I might as well tell you now that I want a divorce"". Now things have been rough for a while... Pointless arguments, so busy we barely have time for each other but I didn't think we were on the road to divorce just in a rough patch with work and having small kids. Come to find out there's another woman in the picture and he decided on Valentine's Day to tell me and ask for divorce AFTER finding out about the baby. I got so desperate in the moment I begged him to stay and work it out but he threatened me and grabbed me hard! Saying ""snap out of it"" I saw a side of him I never seen. He says he's okay with child support but he doesn't want to be present for the baby. He says I can keep the car and house.. but... My heart is crushed as I cry just typing this.. I've spent the last two weeks crying, sick with hyperemesis, not sleeping or eating, and barely functioning enough to care for my two girls. What was a welcomed surprised with the pregnancy feels like an intrusion, a sick joke, or nightmare. I don't want to be a divorced single mom of 3 - one being a newborn. Because of my religion I was very hesitant to even think about abortion but after looking at the big picture and the future for my two daughters (both under 5) I think termination is the best option but I'm scared, sad and confused.

We’re pregnant and living paycheck to paycheck ,"My fiancé (29M) and I (25F) found out a couple weeks ago we are pregnant unexpectedly. I’m currently 10 weeks. We are excited but extremely stressed out because of money.

We just recently had to move to a different state and had to start over. That alone has been a huge struggle. He currently works part time for a company that keeps telling him he will get full time and benefits soon, while I am currently working part time making commission which has been difficult because it’s a slow season. I also have a side gig that helps bring in a bit of money. But we are still living paycheck to paycheck right now. 

We have a tiny one bedroom apartment that we pay $700 a month for, and the wiring in this building is messed up and we are paying almost $400 a month for electricity that we aren’t even using. I’m fairly certain because the wiring is all over the place that we are paying part of someone else’s electricity bill. The landlord won’t do anything about it. But between rent, electric, groceries, gas, and other bills, we have no money by the end of the month. 

I want to get a second job but I don’t know when it’s going to get busy again at my current work place, and I’ve also been incredibly sick so far during this pregnancy. I struggle to even work one job. 

I just don’t know what to do. I need any advice or reassurance that everything will work out. I’m sure it’s not healthy for me or the baby to be stressing as much as I have been. I just want to live comfortably and give our baby a good life.

Quick question,"So, I had this weird thought and I wanted to ask, as TV shows that discuss this are wayy different from reality:

Should it be illegal for people to intentionally poke holes in condoms, say they are using BC when they are not, people who non consentually remove the condom before finishing as a way to ""babytrap"" their partner?

 I mean, it's illegal (atleast in the US where I live I don't know other countries, here is I think a felony) to not disclose STI status after diagnosis if you plan to have sex protected or not. Because they are trying to make abortions illegal, should be just as illegal to force a pregnancy if a partner if they do not want one, especially so if they cannot risk it due to health reasons?

I just honestly want to know what other people think. ",1b1hmix,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/1b1hmix/quick_question/,"['I thought it was illegal? Reproductive coercion', 'Yes.

"19, 5'1, white male, 12 years of chronic pain, persistent mucus production","Subject: Seeking Advice on Persistent Nasal Mucus Production and chronic pain.  
  
Hello r/AskDocs,  
  
I hope this community can provide some insights or suggestions regarding a persistent health issue I've been dealing with for quite some time. I'm a 19-year-old individual who has been experiencing chronic symptoms for the past 12 years.  


  
**Notable information that may or may not be related to the post.**  


* Was advised to take hormone shots when younger, I was at the time afraid of needles (not vaccinations) and wasn't convinced by parent to pursue the treatment. Their reasoning was my parents were short, so I'd likely be as well.  

* During the start of my daily chronic migraines, the school tried to keep me in school attending as much days as possible, which is fine as studdies show it's beneficial and insert 50 other reasons here. However to do so, the nurse gave me Excedrin migraine (extra strength) which at the time had caffeine, an nsaid + acetaminophen. I was given multiple of these pills a day at the highest dosage. Then with the migraines not improving, I got a ped neurologist, they ran through the usual testing, usual first line medications, then there was nothing left. They esentially said there's nothing they can do with the current limitations of pediatrics, at the time not even botox was allowed. I was homebound from school from the pain being so severe, the lights and sound was too much. The kids being so loud and the type of lights they use. The ped neuro was back and forth between either keeping me on homebound, or removing it entirely, as in, they literally one month had me on homebound, then the next expected every single day for me to attend. One year they had me entirely on homebound, then the last month of school I wasn't.. extremely odd ways to coax someone back into an environment, but that's unrelated. The neuro seemed to think regardless of the pain that I should attend school everyday. The school ended up calling the neuro.. (yes, an educational system with no medical expertise) they said they believed it was in my best interest to not be on homebound. My mom at the time, fought both of them, and we ended up going to court for truency, which resulted in us winning. The neuro gave up esentially.. every appointment was essentially saying I need to drink water and go to school and my pain will go away. This may seem exhaggerated, but it's exactly what was said. She even at one point brought in a med student and said if I won't listen to her about it, then a second opinion saying exactly what she said would make a difference. At one point I was so frustrated when I was a child I was crying/yelling during an appointment about how I've tried everything for pain relief, the water, all of the medications, and it causes so much pain to be put through what I was put through, that going to school with the migraines not being fixed will only cause me more pain. I kid you not, after the session, she listed in my profile that I have a tendency of truancy, behavioral issues, and \*\*neglect\*\*.

* They also prescribed 30 triptans a month, by giving 15 and saying to either cut it in half or just take it every other day. I won't go into semantics on why that's not a good idea by any means,  I can guarantee these actions resulted in some sort of moh (rebound). I only found out of the affects of moh and rebounds when I was 16-17, I went cold turkey on all pain relief meds for a year. Nowadays I limit any abortive (triptans, pain relief, or anything related to pain reduction) to 4 times a month max, with the obvious daily migraine prevention medications.

  
**Duration and Frequency:**  
Since the age of 7, after a severe viral infection, I have been dealing with daily chronic migraines, tinnitus, and an unusual symptom of nonstop nasal mucus production. I haven't gotten a single day of relief from the pain, as in total reduction. I quite literally don't remember what not being in pain feels like, the though of it seems impossible.. and for the longest time from 7-13 I thought the pain was normal, until I spoke up about it. The mucus appears as giant globs, primarily white in color, and is significant enough to cover sheets of tissue paper. This occurs multiple times a day and has been a consistent issue for the past decade.  
  
**Attempts at Relief:**  
I've sought medical attention and have seen an ENT specialist who conducted a nasal examination with a camera, which came back normal. I've tried every first and second line treatment for migraine, lifestyle changes. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers (as niche as it is), gabapentin, other antiseizure meds for migraine, all cgrp meds, botox, propanolol, co-q10, b12, feverfew, butterbur.. I think you get the point. Any niche or first line prescription or remedy for daily migraines I've tried. Good sleep hygeine, different shades of glasses (fl-41 tint), changing the kelvin of all lights in my house to a frequency that's comftorable for migraine paitents. For my nose, various interventions have been tried, including corticosteroid and antihistamine nasal sprays, a neti pot, and over-the-counter remedies. Unfortunately, these interventions have not provided significant relief.   


My current medications with dosages are: propanolol xr 80mg, vyvanse 60mg, vilazodone 40mg, daily vitamin, fish oil, co-q10, b12, b2, d3  


Testing: I quite literally asked my PCP to run every single blood test, may be seen as excessive yes, but my insurance covered it. B complex, bmp, cmp, cbc, crp, sed rate, blood sugar levels, hormone testing for a potential imbalance,  I tested every vitamin that's possible, fat soluble, got genetic testing done. EKG, sleep study, ct scan.. probably missing more. Nerve blocks can be a hit or miss, I get it with botox as well, they sometimes provide relief, but it always reduces the pain, the numb feeling is a lifetime better than what it usually is. I get either bi yearly or yearly mris, all so far have came back normal besides 1 when I was 8. The notes said there was a ""flair"" at a certain location and to comeback in x amount of time for another test, the following test it was resolved and unremarkable.   
  
**Impact on Daily Life:**  
The mucus production has led to persistent nasal congestion, making it difficult for me to breathe through my nose during the day and at night. As a result, I've resorted to mouth breathing, impacting my quality of life. Additionally, the mucus turns yellow and burns when I'm about to be sick, serving as an unusual early warning sign. It also requires a lot of force for it to come out of my nose, without expelling it every few hours I cannot breathe out of my nose. During a discharge it sometimes makes a loud sound, or my eardrums pop. My daily migraines have led me to a life that's similar to those during covid, yet that's my reality for the last 12 years.. I'm in a remote college but even that is hard as it is, I exercise and try to prioritize anything proven to provide relief, cbt, I've tried cefaly, nerivo for migraines.. I have a diy migraine cap that I made, I bought these migraine gel strips in bulk from a manufacturer, a few hundred, similar to those u can find at cvs or a drugstore for fever relief, it slightly takes the edge off since I store it in the freezer and the cold somewhat masks the pain, but it's not enough to still be able to function and reacclimate into society.  
  
**Concerns and Seeking Guidance:**  
I'm reaching out to this community to seek any insights, suggestions, or similar experiences that might shed light on the potential causes of these symptoms. Unlikely, but could there be underlying issues that haven't been explored, or are there alternative treatments that I should consider? I'm at the point of where I'd go out of network (I have Medicaid) into debt, or even try an experimental treatment/clinical study, or even pay for a provider or treatment that would provide relief. A literal quarter of my entire life has been taken from me.. and half of the most active time of my life. I want to be able to go outside, or even have the choice to do sports, enjoy time out with my fiance without planning around my pain, just have a shred of normalcy while I'm still young.  
  
I understand that this platform doesn't substitute professional medical advice, but any guidance or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. If there are specific tests or specialists that I should consider consulting, please let me know.   
  
Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide. I'm eager to gather information that may help me address these persistent health challenges.

One Catholic School has produced dozens of rapes,"I’m going to try to keep this short and sweet. I graduated from a very well respected catholic high school in California. The students were what I liked to call “Old Money” because some of these kids were going to be heirs of multi billion dollar companies, they drove porches and Bentleys, and had unlimited access to cocaine. 

Dozens upon dozens of rumors and stories have come out since graduating in 2011. And I am not talking about your typical high school drama here… 

I had 3 teachers who were deeply romantically involved with friends of mine. Only 2 have been officially accused and 1 of them actually fled the country when a student from the 70’s accused him of statutory rape. 

A close friend of mine has also shared that she was not only raped, but she was gang raped by 4 football players. That same girl was assaulted AGAIN and became pregnant. 

Another friend of mine was assaulted by someone at a party, got pregnant, had an abortion. The week after she did so, we walked to our cars after school and there we saw her truck covered in red car paint that said baby killer and 6 football players were jumping on it and urinating on it. 

Now I understand that every person goes through it in high school. It sucks, but the examples above are just scratching the surface. I’m tempted to write a book or start a tik tok account to chronicle what happened to me and a lot of other women.

"The Basis for Abortion ""Exceptions""","Even among those who feel abortion should be banned, most want to make exceptions for situations such as rape, incest, or endangerment of the pregnant person's life.

Can these exceptions be justified in terms of a moral framework or rule?  Many people oppose abortion on the grounds that the unborn deserves personal rights. If this is the case, why would there be an exception for rape or incest?  Does one have lesser rights if their father (or mother, perhaps) is a rapist?  Does one have lesser rights due to the pregnancy complications another person is having?

It seems that if one takes an anti-abortion stance based on principles of personhood or rights that one takes as self-evident or absolute, then one must adhere to those principles regardless of circumstance.

If one believes every unborn has the right to be born, why would that not include those conceived via rape or those unborn who unfortunately have a mother who might die from their birth?",1b1gwdt,9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1b1gwdt/the_basis_for_abortion_exceptions/,"['Welcome to /r/Abortiondebate!

"Found out I'm not just a few weeks gone, but 18 weeks. Stunned. Questions on remains & baby scans..","hello lovely people 💖

I'm so grateful for this sub, youve all kept me sane since i found out this news. I found out 2 weeks ago I'm somehow pregnant, my bf and I have been together 10 years and I've always been so strict with my contraceptive. However, it turns out around the time i changed from the combined pill to the mini pill, that seems to be roughly when I'd caught. 

I'm sorry this is likely a mess of a post...I've not once posted on here, only read everyone's amazing, inspiring and heartfelt advice and stories.  today upon finding out during the scan that I'm in fact 18 weeks gone, not the few weeks my bf and I assumed...a new wave of emotions has slammed into me, despite always knowing in my heart I never want children. 


I've ended up making a throwaway account to just air this all out today. I'm so grateful the resources here for us in the UK and won't ever take it for granted. Today's first official scan, wonderful gentle nurses who advised me I'd need a surgical procedure,  despite me fully stupidly getting into the mindset of having a MA today. so I'm scheduled for early next week for the surgery. During the scan today, I'd asked the nurses if I could please see the image on the screen. I know my mind was made to to have an abortion well beforehand, and thankfully my bf and I have always been on the same page through discussions in the past but my god I never thought this would've actually happened.

when looking at the scan, I think I was just in so much shock finding out how far gone I was to really take anything in. I knew beforehand I'd want to look for my own personal clarity and closure, but it all hit me when I got home and I've cried confusing tears as I still know my decision is right for me 100%, and my bf would support me either way which I'm so glad for.

I guess I have two questions please if anyone could kindly share some insight...I'm based in the UK, and this surgery will be performed by BPAS,  and at 18 weeks I'll need another scan with them first. Would I be able to ask for a copy of the scan to keep? I'm such a sentimental person even alongside my decision, I feel its something I'd want to keep in a trinket box safe somewhere.

and secondly, this feels so morbid and surreal to even type...they'd mentioned today that BPAS could potentially give me the remains, cremated. I know I'd really want this, too.

with me being 18 weeks, is this possible?

thank you all so much again for this safe place. I'm feeling sad and shocked yet eternally grateful of this place, of the resources I'm lucky to have, for my bf, too, and for myself.

Always campaign in Minnehaha

1. This is a plain unadulterated piece of poppycock. I have never once in  17 years cast a vote against the farmers of South Dakota and the nation.  I may well have voted against the big business front masquerading  behind the Farm Bureau name, but never against the farmers. I'm  surprised that I even voted with them once in 14 times. 
2. It's unfortunate, this style of  politics. The race has not even begun yet in earnest and hundreds of  thousands of dollars are pouring in from special interests, attempting  to sow division between myself and Senator Byrd. I am proud to have his  support, and his tenacity and honesty will carry us through this  campaign. We aren't changing a thing. 
3. I was quite surprised by Mr. Schumaker's decision to return to South  Dakota after a nearly twenty year long sabbatical. His vision is  woefully narrow. He has not stated his proposals for the state's  agricultural workers, or what he'd bring to the table whatsoever,  frankly. I am proud to call South Dakota my home and will continue to  advocate for the issues that matter to the people of this state. 
4. I am the strongest pro-life candidate  in 1980. To make abortion illegal under all circumstances is to drive  desperate women into back alleys and the unsanitary rooms of butchers  with coat hangers. Then we lose not only the fetuses, but the young  mothers-- and that is not respect for life. 
5. Mr. Schumaker's assertion isn't entirely wrong, I have been in the  Senate for sometime. In that body, I serve as first in line to succeed  the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee and second for Foreign  Relations. But let me say, seniority in the Senate doesn't mean much  unless its used in the public interest. My seniority has enabled me to  prevent the weaking of our farm price support and credit programs--  experience matters.  
6. Yes, I'd say I am. A dove is a cool headed bird who doesn't believe in  taking the young men of this nation into war unless the national  interest is involved. If any aggressor attacks this nation or our  historic allies, I will be a hawk ready for battle.
7. It is the most rational thing in the  world for me to be a strong advocate of equal rights for women because I  have lived with a woman for thirty-six years who only only insists on  equal rights, but who has always carried equal responsibilities. I will  not- and cannot- give up the fight for the Equal Rights Amendment.
8. The admakers have been running wild with this notion that I've been  absent from South Dakota. When I am in Washington or elsewhere, my  staff- whom I afford my upmost trust and confidence- are responsive to  the needs of my constituents. 
9. I resent it. When I come out of God's house on Sunday morning and find  some misguided political agent has put a leaflet on my car accusing me  of being anti-family and a killer of babies. Who appointed these  single-issue advocates to play God in judging us? 
10. Well, the obvious answer would be to  knock on every door in Minnehaha until they start answering with  shotguns. Sioux Falls is where I imagine Ted and the President will be  competing for the most votes-- whoever wins there will likely win the  state. 
11. I believe very strongly that we live  now in the midst of a crime epidemic. I've long since proposed a  policemen's Bill of Rights, in the vein of the GI Bill, to encourage  more young Americans to consider a career as a peacekeeper. I believe a  well-funded and well managed police corps is the most effective counter  to violent crime, and I will do- as I have done- everything in my power  to promote such an idea.  
12. If I'm there, I'll be the dominant  voice for northern farmers. Senator Talmadge of Georgia, the current  chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee, is only interested in  cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and rice. I'll be able to speak for wheat,  soybeans, and feed grains. I want to be there to save our farmers. 
13. Like myself, Representative Abdnor  makes frequent trips to and from Washington-- that's one of many  Congressional responsibilities. My opponent, if he emerges the victor  come November, will likely need a long-term residence in the Washington  area, just the same as I have. He ought to know better; I bring South  Dakota to the capitol, not the other way around. 
14. The Soviet Union and the United  States hold the capacity to launch a nuclear war that would not only end  life in our two countries, but most forms of life on the planet. If  that happened, there'd be no worries over inflation, or taxes. There  will be only the horrible remains of a dead or dying civilization  choking in radioactive dust.  
15. And associate myself with the scum who called my own ex-wife to stand  trial in kangaroo court? They want me out? Fine. I'm out. And I'm not  endorsing that little vulture Miller or anyone else. I'll sit out my  term and then I'm out.  (note: managing to win while not picking this anwser gives you an achivment)
16. The land issue will be settled in the courts and tribal council. There  is no conceivable world wherein the United States returns full  sovereignty over the Black Hills to the Sioux, and I think the tribe has  been quite clear they are not interested in anything short of a full  return. Still, we can do more to solve problems facing average residents  on the reservations, such as addiction recovery facilities and  expanding access to attend higher education.  
17. The nation's agriculture industry, I  think, faces the greatest challenge ever presented to a single sector of  our economy. The production of alcohol for use as a pure fuel provides  the means to achieve a vast reduction in our dependence on oil, while at  the same time continuing to meet the needs for food and fiber for this  country and for those around the world who depend on us. I think this  challenge must and can be met. 
18. Incorporating these charges into my broader message is only natural.  There are rules for collusion between candidates and their backing  organizations. If Representative Abdnor and NCPAC violated the law, the  public deserves to know  
19. Contrary to NCPAC's contention,  Senator McGovern and Mr. Cunningham could not have ""made public"" the  complaint, for that complaint had already been a matter of public  knowledge for three weeks. Several hours before the complaint was filed  -- Senator McGovern's office issued a release supporting the Party's  attempt through its complaint to address alleged illegal acts by NCPAC. 
20. There's really nothing more myself or  anyone else can do at this point to coax Representative Abdnor onto the  debate stage. A man pursuing the office of Senator cannot be one who  ducks challenges; debates allow the people of this state to hear the  candidates articulate their positions, but also to see them as men and  get a feel for their character. The public must be aware of his refusal,  and the best way to do that is in speeches and advertisements.  
21. I'm very glad to be back in the home  of the Jackrabbits! I may be running for Senate, but I wouldn't stand a  chance against the running backs of SDSU, if last weeks game was any  indication **OR** Before  I begin, I need to get something off my chest that's weighed heavy on  my conscience for almost thirty years now. I've always been scared to  death of Brookings. It's okay to laugh! Some of you may now I was a  debater throughout high school-- that's where I met my wife, in fact. I  used to dread going up against those kids from Brookings because I knew I  was in for a challenge from some of the best and brightest this state  has to offer.  (both have the same result)
22. To label me as antifamily- as I have been by these organizations who pay  millions to have me unseated- is the most gross and deeply offensive  attacks on my character. I am a proud father of five children and four  grandchildren. I love my family more than anything.  
23. When you think of George McGovern,  what do you think of? A liberal who supports outlandish policies such as  SALT II and the Equal Rights Amendment, surely. Well, so does President  Ford. A man who doesn't? James Abdnor. I think newspaper and radio ads  highlighting the incongruence between the beliefs of Jim and that of  Jerry will prove surprisingly informative for Republican voters. 
24. The elaborate system of 200 mobile MX missiles, being planned at a cost  of from $30 to $100 billion, would be effectively neutralized by Soviet  land-based missiles in the event of nuclear war, unless we were prepared  to double or triple our MX force at double or triple the cost. The  result would be astronomical increases in the defense budget, with  commensurate effects on the rate of inflation. 
25. I respect Jim Abdnor for his humble  service; he's not a man intent on ladder-climbing or chasing the big  seat. It is abundantly clear to me, then, that it was only at the urging  of outside influence groups like NCPAC that he entered this race with  the promise of financial and tactical support if he did so.  
26. Every President from General Eisenhower to Jimmy Carter as well as the  Joint Chiefs of Staff have, in some way, supported a return of the canal  to the Panamanians. I think it's because these men have looked ahead to  what the potential costs are, and I'm talking fianical costs, foreign  policy costs, political costs, and the potential loss of life on which  it is very difficult to put a dollar sign. 
27. The one good thing that's happened, however late in the campaign, is  that Abdnor, NCPAC, and I all agree that NCPAC's been a disaster. I just  wish a year ago when I started to warn about NCPAC that he was as much  concerned then as he is now. 
28. Whatever makes him happy.

[Ca] Unmarried advice on custody ,"Hi all, I’m new here and desperately seeking advice and education on how to go about this. 

A little background: I (30F) found out I was pregnant last week with my then boyfriend (28M). I’m currently a full-time Masters student and I don’t graduate until May 2025. I have the full support of my family who have agreed to support both me and a newborn while I finish school, meaning my parents would move in with me after I deliver. 

Four days after I discovered I was pregnant, I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me and I broke up with him and kicked him out. He is now asking that I abort the fetus, but I’m not exactly leaning that way. I’m feel ready to be a mom and was thinking marriage and children with him before any of this happened. 

My question is: how would this legally play out? I obviously am in a vulnerable position being pregnant, jobless, and in grad school (not allowed to work during my program). I can’t afford a nasty custody battle. I’d like to work it out cordially with agreed shared custody, but I don’t even know how that would play out financially. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about this mess? ",1b1gr37,3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Custody/comments/1b1gr37/ca_unmarried_advice_on_custody/,"[""If you're not in a relationship, he's in a relationship with someone else a and is still asking you to abort, why are you anticipating a custody battle?\n\nIf you want him to share custody and support your child why not let him? If you don't want him to, there's the option of just ghosting on him; if you're not coming after him for child support then how likely is he to track you down, establish paternity and get a custody order?\n\nUnless you're hiding something dire there's no scenario where he's going to come swoop in and take your baby way from you. Under the best of circumstances with a newborn he would have very limited visits stepping up to 50/50 toward toddler age. In most cases in your scenario where the dad wasn't there when the baby was born, he's never going to get 50/50."", 'I’m in a similar situation. Unmarried. He asked me to abort, and is with his ex gf now. I didn’t and his form of retaliating is to threaten 50/50 custody at birth with an agreement to no support because I’d imagine he’s afraid I’m going to do that. I won’t because I don’t want him to have any rights to this child. I wouldn’t worry about it until after birth. You may not even have a battle to fight if he doesn’t take any action. Make him establish paternity if he wants, leave him off the certificate, and in the mean time cut all contact. Don’t stress yourself out like I did, enjoy your pregnancy. You deserve it.', 'Having a baby alone is incredibly hard, and you will have this asshole in your life for the next 18 years. I would advise terminating the pregnancy. Finish school, use your degree, establish yourself. Otherwise you are not setting you or your child up for the life you deserve, that you have worked for.', 'Be mindful that he can file for and get up to 50/50 custody at any point- even ten years down the road after having never even asked about the child. If you are willing to share custody or raise the baby yourself- depending on how he is feeling then you be fully prepared', 'I think you’re giving him a little too much credit if you’re expecting a custody “battle” from him because he’s making it clear he doesn’t even want to be a father.  Instead, what you will have to do is contact the California Child Support Services once your child is born and open a case to establish paternity, a parenting schedule, and child support; the state will take care of all those matters free of charge without heading to court.  Honestly, be prepared to raise that child alone, you have been warned', 'I would cut off all ties with him. Have the baby privately and raise it by yourself. If you have a grad degree, you will eventually be independent. You don’t want to tie yourself with that guy forever', ""I would recommend getting a lawyer. Most custody cases are messy and complicated. Does he have an interest in the baby? You could always ask him to revoke his rights as a father if he's telling you he doesn't want a child... \n\nUsually courts and the systems will always rehabilitate dad's and mum's to be in their children's lives. Unless he's done something wrong he has every right to be in that child's life and even if he has done something wrong the system will rehabilitate that relationship between him and the child. Essentially you both will have equal rights unless an agreed settlement or court order."", 'If you don’t put him on the birth cert, he has no rights(but you won’t be able to collect child support.) if you do put him on the birth cert, you can collect child support (but he can fight for 50% custody. It’s a tough call. I was in the same spot as you last year & had him sign the birth cert & now left him and taking him to court for custody and child support.', 'EDIT: thanks to everyone for the advice and feedback. To clarify some things: if I did go through with the pregnancy, he has said he would be involved but he doesn’t want a child that’s a part of a broken home (he came from one). He has said we will need to get therapy and work out our problems. I just can’t see myself ever trusting him again and viewing him the same, so I don’t exactly love that option. \n\nI also need to speak with my grad program and discuss options. For me, my education comes first, so if it would set me back and I wouldn’t graduate on time, I would lean towards aborting. \n\nI’m just in a confused, hurt, and vulnerable situation looking for help from strangers on the internet, thanks for your 2 cents.']"

“Mercy” killing?,"I think I know the general stance on this, but I’d figure I’d ask anyways.

Say your comrade gets severely burnt or blown up by napalm or mustard gas or some such horrible device in war, or something, and is lying there writhing in agony, begging you to “put him out of his misery.” To do so is never morally licit in Catholic ethics, correct?

Hence it is not lawful for man to take his own life that he may pass to a happier life, nor that he may escape any unhappiness whatsoever of the present life, because the ultimate and most fearsome evil of this life is death, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. iii, 6).

I cant find my happiness,"I am M(17). So this past weeks i was having a hard time at home. I felt unhappy. Even though i have all the things such as family, friends, school, girlfriend, and all the things i need. I still feel unhappy.

I am aware that i’ve done things. At my young age, i am sexually active, drinking and vaping. Although i am not a heavy drinking, i’ve been having a hard time stopping from vape. I know to myself i can stop but Everytime i see my friends vaping, it just attracts me back. My family is religious, Every time my mom scolds me she always tells me that all the things im doing has it’s karma on me. She also tells me that, maybe my karma also affected my grandma because i love her so much. She tells me that they are suffering all because of the karma that i made. Since then i always felt like it was my fault. Home doesn’t feel the same since my grandma got sick, it felt unhappy,  the energy doesn’t feel the same anymore. I can’t get to be happy again. 

I’ve done things. Me and my girlfriend is sexually active. So recently she had a delayed period. Me and my gf talked and we’ve agreed to abort it if it’s confirmed. But it never happened, she tested negative. But the thought of “abort” kills me. It kills my guilt. I prayed and ask for forgiveness but the guilt is still there, i felt like i sinned for thinking that way. I am also vaping, disobeying my parents, drinking but im not that miserable child. Im js that normal kid that is exploring, i know my limits and i have fear. But ever since my mom told me that everything that is happening to the family and to me is my fault because of the bad karma that i brought in. I never felt the same. I felt like it is my fault. I feel lost and unhappy. I am active and happy at school but when i come home, i dont feel it anymore. I feel sad and unmotivated. Even though my girlfriend is there to make me feel loved and happy, i still feel unsatisfied with my life. I know deep in my guts that there is something missing. Something i want to do but i can’t find it. I want to bring back the old me, my old self. I want to be happy again. So i am here to ask for your advices and suggestion. I will look and listen to your advices and i will surely learn from it. Thank you!

When it comes to feeling guilty about something, I like to break things down from a logical viewpoint rather than a belief(?). In this scenario, if I felt I were to blame for my grandmother falling sick, I would separate the possible reasons as to why they happened into two different columns: belief or fact. For example, it is a belief that she fell sick because of my karma, but it is a fact that she fell sick because of old age, etc. The fact that she fell sick due to old age is not something I can cause or control, so why should I blame myself?\n\n2. As for feeling unhappy, sometimes I feel like life is meaningless and boring. There is nothing to look forward to, nothing new. Whenever I get like that, I write down foods I want to eat (honestly this probably only works for people that loves to eat..) and think of how delicious it'll be. Somehow, it makes me look forward to the day I'll be able to eat it and the anticipation makes it taste even better and makes me happier. If food isn't your thing, think of things to buy or do that makes you happy, write it down, and treat yourself to them one by one whenever you feel unhappy.\n\nThese methods may not work for you, and there is nothing wrong with that! Everyone is different and it doesn't mean that you are too far gone or that things will never get better. It is all a matter of creating a system that works well for you, by you. You can use these as inspiration or tweak some parts to better suit you, and I hope this helped a bit!\n\nLife may not get better immediately, but experiencing some small bouts of happiness every once in a while makes it more bearable."", 'I believe your mother is wrong. Karma doesn\'t exist, at least not in a probable way, and even if you believe it does - you\'re a normal kid. You\'re experimenting. You\'re not evil and don\'t deserve bad things to happen to you just because you\'re trying new things. Nothing you\'re doing is inherently ""wrong"" - maybe just vaping because your health could be physically damaged by it and it sounds like you may be getting addicted to it - but even then, you\'re not hurting anyone else. But everything else is totally subjective, and for some reason your mom seems to lean toward a view that villifies you in a really unfair, downright cruel way. She must be in a lot of pain and is just looking for a target to blame. You\'re absolutely not at fault for the misfortunes of others that have nothing to do with you. It\'s despicable and vile that your mom would blame you for your grandmothers\' health. Life just sucks sometimes. There\'s not always a reason.\n\nThe sadness you feel is very understandable considering your living conditions and the guilt your family subjects you to. I hope you can forgive yourself and treat yourself kindly and patiently. Talk to yourself like you would talk to a friend.\n\nAlso please learn more about safe sex and contraception. Hormonal contraception generally is the most effective, but a correctly fitting condom + spermicide (VCF gel is OTC and works right away) is an excellent non-hormonal option as well.

What the FUCK is going on?,,1b1g3ps,918,58,https://i.redd.it/3pkteuy5n5lc1.png,"['The complaint is on the language of the bill.\n\nIt uses vague statements that Republicans have been apt at using in the past to ban stuff even when it was protected. \n\nSome key takeaways are:\n\n ""Reasonable medical necessity"" is not clearly defined, which will fall on lawmakers to define what is and isn\'t reasonable.\n\nThe use of the term women in the bill vs people or individuals will allow the state to effectively ban abortions for minors and trans men, both of whom are frequent victims of unwanted pregnancies as a result of sexual assault.\n\nThere is also concerns that the bill language was not drafted with the inclusion of Indigenous voices, LGBTQIA+ voices, and various other groups of stakeholders in South Dakota, instead it was drafted by 5 people, who are all related to each other to some degree and are mostly men. Hardly the diversity we want on something like this.\n\nFinally, as this is a constitutional amendment, it will be hard to change once it goes through, and the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, who are used to fighting with the linguistic acrobatics the Republicans like to use want a concrete bill that was developed with multiple perspectives. They don\'t want to be stuck defending something made in haste, that is ""Easy"" to make loop holes in.\n\nThese are just paraphrases of the arguments made by the ACLU and Planned Parenthood of South Dakota.', 'Haven\'t researched this specific issue, but it sounds like activists in SD are letting perfect be the enemy of good.\n\nPolitics are negotiations.  You ask for the world, knowing you won\'t get everything.  You haggle until you got all of your ""core"" demands.  Then you do it all again in a few years.\n\nSometimes incremental progress is too incremental.  When the alternative is virtually banned abortions, though, take what you can get.\n\n\n\nEdit: I\'ve since researched a bit and here\'s what I\'ve come up with:\n\nAccording to [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-abortion-ballot-initiative-dd0da89de4fd6d1ef133a57d697e3faf), the bill enshrines the right to an abortion in the SD state constitution, but only partially.  The law would make it so that there is no regulation of abortion in the first trimester (good), but can be regulated in the second, and can only be done in the third if the mother\'s life is at risk.  That\'s honestly pretty on par with what abortion was under RvW anyway.  Sounds good so far.  Worth noting is that Republicans are fighting against the bill, so that\'s also a sign that it\'s a good initiative.\n\nThe [ACLU](https://www.aclusd.org/en/press-releases/aclu-comments-house-committee-vote-condemn-citizen-led-ballot-initiative#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20House%20State%20Affairs,opposes%20House%20Concurrent%20Resolution%206008), however, is worried about setting a precedent that citizens can initiate a vote on whether something is allowed in the state constitution.  I can\'t say for sure, but that\'s probably because it\'s likely to be struck down in a conservative state like SD, and then the precedent is that it *shouldn\'t* be in the state constitution, which other states could point to and get it banned/overturned there as well.\n\nMy take is that there\'s not really a good answer here.  The bill\'s creators used language from other states\' successful attempts to enshrine abortion rights (nice work), but if the ACLU is worried about setting a failing precedent, they\'re probably right and the bill should be reworked and reintroduced at a time when it is much more likely to be successful, aka when Democrats actually have a majority in the state (which isn\'t often).  \n\nGet out there and vote for your representatives, SD!', 'Fucking idiots. Progressives who don\'t understand how progression works. \n""Perfect is the enemy of good""', ""The left is eating itself alive.

What I regret -- it's not what you think,"Abortion care saved my life and paved the way for a very good future. Still — looking back, I have many regrets:  
I regret having so little self respect that I endured terrible treatment from selfish, callous, abusive men.   
I regret that I believed what the ‘adults’ told me about being a human who can reproduce in a world built by people who cannot reproduce — a world set up by men for the benefit of men. I regret not seeing much sooner that it was all gaslighting and silence, rather than truth and knowledge.  
I regret allowing myself to be hurt by all the manipulative stigmas that made me doubt my own instincts and feel ashamed of my body, my sexuality and my period, my reproductive experiences.  
I cannot go back and fix any of that.   
But there is one more regret that I can actually do something about now:  
I regret that at the time of my care I was so distraught that I probably didn’t thank all the people at the clinic who were involved in saving my life and my future.  
Although I don’t know their names and cannot thank them directly now — I can send out into the world words of gratitude to all providers in honor of the ones who saved me.  
You can imagine my joy when — just the other day — I saw on-line an outpouring of love for an abortion provider that started with “The Sweet Feminist.” I am sharing it in this space now, hoping that anyone involved in abortion care — physicians, nurses, doulas, funders, counselors, advocates, supporters — will see it and feel loved and appreciated:

"spotting 13 days after MA, pregnant?","I had my MA last February 13. After a few hours of pain, it subsided into a normal period pain which lasted for 5 days, after, it was just spotting which stopped on February 21.

My mom (F42) is struggling with me being trans (M17),"To be clear, my parents aren’t bad people. It’s just a bad situation. I’m not angry and we don’t hate each other.

We moved to Germany summer of 2023 because of my dad’s job. I came out to my dad as trans, and my mom found out accidentally. They’re not taking it well and there have been many large fights since September 2023 because of me, at least one fight a month where one parents leaves the house for a few hours/days before coming back. My parents, for the most part, have started to ignore it as best as they can. They’re lenient parents who give me freedom as long as I’m being good but they’re still old fashion and believe in gender roles. They also had expectations for me and my brother that we don’t live up to so no matter what, me and my brother are disappointments.

My mom has been getting agitated with me. I put myself into counseling and am looking into T (not starting- just trying to get info on it) and my mom doesn’t like it. I know I’m mentally ill but she doesn’t wanna put me in therapy because she doesn’t want any mental illnesses to get put on my record. She also doesn’t like me being trans. For the past three days she’s been giving me the silent treatment and I don’t know what to do. The only thing she talks to me about is sending me to family in America and sends messages through my brother. 

I don’t know what to do. She’s mourning her daughter and I know it hurts, but how do I fix things? I miss my mom and I wish she would look at me again. Here’s a few things she repeats a lot:
“I wish I had a child I could be proud of”
“I wish I had a daughter I could dress up with and do hair and makeup with”
“I wish I never aborted your sibling”

I have very good grades and am very social, hanging out with friends and going out a lot. My mom always complained that my brother wasn’t experiencing high school correctly cause he stayed at home a lot. I also love dressing up, I just stopped doing make up and I cut my hair to be more comfortable. Do I really have to choose between being who I want and being who my mom wants?

Is there anything I could do? I don’t wanna be sent to America and lose everything again but my mom can barely stand being around me anymore. She listens to her sister a lot, who is a psychologist who works with teens. She cherry picks her words a lot though so I don’t know what’s the truth and what’s not. Would it be ok to ask my aunt what my mom is telling her?

Sorry if this is kinda all over the place. Tldr; My mom can barely stand being around me but I want to fix our relationship.

Help Decoding Ciphered Telegrams from Art Buyer in 1910s?,"Hi - I'm an art historian researching the market for antiquities in the early 20th century. I've been looking in the archive, held at Oxford, of the papers of John Marshall, who purchased Greek and Roman antiquities for the Metropolitan Museum (New York). The archive includes a letter book in which he drafted and decoded ciphered telegraphs with the museum (sent between 1907-1913). I'm hoping for help deciphering the messages that remain in code. Below I'm pasting transcriptions first of the messages where Marshall decodes the cipher and then the still coded ones. Is there any hope of breaking this cipher? Thank you!

Conspiracy: American Regression is the Result of Capitalist-Techno Cults,"That Republicans happened to jump on board for their Christo-Fascist ethnostate is an unhappy accident that happens to align with the late-stage capitalists' designs.

They all are aware how much climate change is going to screw with their cheap sources of labor and materials in the global south. The social instability that is going to happen is going to make the transport of goods in and out of a production facility in a nation suffering from climate collapse extraordinarily expensive. Costs for securing the facilities are going to go up, so why not move them back home?

The problem is, currently, American workers are comparatively expensive.

Before they bring their production facilities back to the US, they need a cheaper work force. They use their vast amounts of resources to engender hostility between the right and the left, between the hetro and not, between the races, anything to distract from the real war: the class war.

Now that they have a suitable schism, they need to start producing that work force. Encourage the government to begin implementing policies that keep the proles desperate and unsatisfied. Encourage the religious to start implementing laws and policies that increase birth rates. Encourage the populace and government to be anti-immigration on a race basis so that it cannot be argued against and so you have full control over all of the ideas and communication of a captured workforce. Relax child labor laws. Destroy the education system so that no commoner can learn about alternatives to being nearly slave labor.

When an impoverished woman has six children because she has an abusive spouse, she's not allowed to get divorced, and she's not allowed to have an abortion, what do you think is going to happen? That family needs to be supported. The father may or may not be in the picture because the oligarchs have instilled a sense of entitlement to women's bodies in the male population. So, those kids are going to work. They're going to work for whatever the corporatists are willing to give them, because otherwise their little sister might starve to death.

This is absolutely going to be the future. We're going back to a time where there were three classes: The nobility, the merchants, and everyone else.

Most of us are going to be everyone else.",1b1eo7j,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenGardenChurch/comments/1b1eo7j/conspiracy_american_regression_is_the_result_of/,"["">the oligarchs have instilled a sense of entitlement to women's bodies in the male population. \n\nI think they want marital rape to be legal. \n\nMaybe they will start peeing on us to mark their property."", 'Great post.

Biden makes appearance on ‘Late Night with Seth Meyers’ for interview ,"President Joe Biden made an appearance Monday on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"" where he answered questions about topics ranging from his age and the Israel-Hamas war to the conservative conspiracy about Taylor Swift.

During Monday's Q&A, Biden was asked early on how he addresses voter concern over his age.

“Take a look at the other guy, he’s about as old as I am,"" said Biden, who at 81 is four years older than former President Donald Trump.

""It’s about how old your ideas are. Look, I mean, this is a guy who wants to take us back,"" Biden added, pointing to Trump's positions on abortion rights, which he suggested were outdated.

Unmotivated ,"I've recently become extremely unmotivated. Here are some details about myself and environment for details:

Gender/Age: 30F

Job: I'm an IT Manager for a small location. I got my programmer certification and was given the promotion from Technician all based on my work ethic. I ran the IT department by myself for 8 months after my old boss left. Upper management was so impressed with me they gave me the promotion. I don't have a degree or prior experience in the field. Before this I had 8 years of fast food management experience and 2 years retail management experience. I was a full time student for computer science but dropped out 2 semesters from finishing due to stress. I was always the top performer in my classes.

Home life: I'm married to a great guy. He's really sweet and understanding. He is a chemist and trying to get a promotion at work for the R&D department for a cannabis industry. It isn't going well and they keep making him empty promises. We've consistently talked about starting a family but don't have the space or financial stability. We're on the same page for all of it and have never fought about it.
We own the duplex we live in, the downstairs apartment we rent to my dad. My mom passed away in 2015, my dad struggled to make ends meet. My mom usually handled all the bills so he wasn't use to doing it. He would often get his utilities shut off or go without eating but wouldn't tell us so he ""wasn't a burden"". I'm the youngest of 5, my siblings would constantly use my dad as a baby sitter for their kids and rides to work without properly paying him or helping him when he obviously needed it. Whenever stuff went south they'd always contact me and I'd rush in to save him. During this time I was working my ass off between school, work and getting the duplex so I could help him. 

Fast forward to now: we own the duplex, moved my dad in. He just pays us a flat amount and we take care of everything. We moved him in just in time, he almost died of self induced type 2 diabetes. I got him situated with some doctors, he's getting new dentures and everything. My siblings still push him off on me Whenever he needs stuff and it honestly ticks me off. I let it go because I know at the end of the day it isn't my dad's fault. He's a good guy and has had a really hard life. 

Childhood: My mom was diagnosed with cervical cancer when I was 9. She went from working 2 jobs to in the hospital. My dad eventually got laid off to be her care taker. My siblings always stayed at their friends house or avoided being home. My parents had a lot on their plate so they didn't have the time to always be present. I didn't want to be a burden so I would clean the house, take care of myself and got decent grades. I made sure they never had to worry about me. We struggled pretty hard sometimes and would get our utilities shut off. I remember doing our laundry in the tub with the neighbors hose. I would even take home food from school. Through out this my mom wasn't the nicest. She would often berate me or snap at me. My dad would defend me, always. Later down the road my siblings moved out and I was the only one at home with my parents. When I got my first job I'd often give them my checks to get by. I eventually moved out, I ended up with an abusive guy who used me and cheated on me. I even got an illegal abortion and luckily survived. When I finally left the asshole at 21 I came back home. I opened up to my mom about all of it and we had a heart to heart. She held me and said if she had known she would have helped me. She went through something similar at the same age. This lead to a conversation where she asked me to look after my dad if anything happened to her. She passed away about a month later. 

There are obviously more details I could give. But I've been trying to work on a business plan i want to do and continue working hard. But I've hit a wall and don't have it in me to do anything anymore. Yes, I struggle with depression but this isn't it. I'm familiar with the animal and that's not what I'm tangling with.

Saw your future. I’m fidgeting in the waiting room.,"
Ryan, 

I almost texted you last night 

I missed you so much. 

I loved you so effortlessly. You were my sun. I felt warm with you. I felt so in love with you. I was so sure about you. I loved you and would have done anything for you. 

I gave you my entire soul and all I asked for was understanding and empathy. 

 I wanted it to be you. 

 I typed in a phrase at the top of the messages looking for a specific text from my aunt, and an old message popped up from you in the related searches.

My heart shattered all over again.

I let you humiliate me. I let you ignore me for days and weeks at times. I blamed myself.

I forgot all the things you said to me. How scared and unsupported you made me feel. 

How angry you were. 

How I just begged you to love me.

I was consistently apologizing for your behavior, like it was my fault for how you decided to continuously speak to me. I was pregnant and terrified. Even before that. You said horrible things to me. I had no idea who you were. You were so fucking mean. 

Why?

You made me feel worthless. 

“So *great* now I'm out 600$ and 1000$ flight and work tomorrow. What a joke. Idk how they could just rebook you.

Like they had to wait until you called them?

Like what the fuck.”

When you were livid about the clinics mis-scheduling. Then you uninvited me on a vacation I busted my ass off for months to go on with you. I gave you about 3 grand and I only got 1,500 back. No vacation, but I did receive PTSD and reactive psychosis after the trauma for months on end.

“why am I angry? Because youre not listening to me. I'm not gonna put aside my intelligent thoughts about the situation because ""you need me"".”

I was so scared and alone. 

“Like what?

Haha btw thanks for letting me know it got rebooked.

Like are you trying to have a baby?”

When you got angry they were overbooked. Kept threatening me to get the abortion that I already planned on getting.

“Just keep it for Wednesday

You're gonna have to go alone

Straight up. 

I can't miss work again

Like what a joke”

“Not to do anything drastic? You don't want to be here? You think you're the only one with those thoughts ?? I'm not gonna let you victimise yourself, those feelings are normal and relatable I feel them too”

When I tried coming to you for how I was feeling because I was not okay with the decision I had to make. It’s something you are blessed to never have gone through. You have no fucking idea the physical and emotional pain I went through for months to come.

“Like I said too, I had to reach out to hear about the rescheduling. After I got my shift covered and begged my boss for help. Like you don't respect my time for shit or my actual effort. I'm just being honest too it all screams fucking carelessness and games”

Like I didn’t have a job. Like I didn’t have to set aside time. It was so fucked up. You did not ever care about me. It was always only about you. I dealt with your screaming and your heartlessness for months. 

“I don't feel bad you've been crying all day and throwing up-that sucks- but you are not the only one. At least you know it's because you're pregnant, wonder if I am too?”

The fact that you thought that, was absolutely unbelievable. I told you I wasn’t going to beg you to love me any longer. I asked you to leave me alone.

“I'm Forsure calling off work tomorrow for the first time ever in my career”

“I’m so sorry that my pregnancy inconveniences you” — I said.

“Yeh me too” 

Then when you finally decided to take me. 

YOU CHANGED YOUR FUCKING MIND. You wanted to keep it. 

You said “I don’t know what happened to you when you were a kid but there’s nothing that you could ever do to hurt this baby, you are the sweetest person I know.” 

You STILL blamed my mental health for why I felt I couldn’t have the baby. 

Was I ready? No. 

But I couldn’t raise a baby with someone who verbally abuses me. Judges me. Lies to me and deflects the horrible things they’ve said to continuously make it my fault without any reflection whatsoever.

I disappeared mentally. You deteriorated me. 

You scared me. I didn’t know who you were anymore, because of your anger I faded into nothing over the course of our relationship. 

THAT IS THE TRUTH. 

I came to you with concerns and questions and you screamed at me and kicked me out of your house the day we found out about the baby. 

After the pill, bleeding out, seizing, in the worst unholy pain I ever felt in my life. 

You ghosted me for nine ironic months.

Went on vacation.

While I died inside. Rotted for months. I tried committing. 

I’m glad I kept all our texts, because I’d be telling you right now that I wished you were here.

I still do. I just wish it wasn’t like this. I could never speak to someone I love the way you did. I will never understand that part. 

I made myself believe it was my fault for nine months. I truly believed that. 

You were right though. I should’ve just taken care of myself. 

I am now. I only ever think of myself. That’s why I officially walked away. You were still the same narcissistic piece of shit who drove me to a point of hopelessness and begging to be loved. 

when you came back to “officially say goodbye” because you needed to “move on”, because you saw *ME* moving on (I had no choice to. You dipped out without a word. Left me with questions, grief, and every horrible thing you’ve ever said to me putting me into a black hole of nothingness for months) 

You didn’t even think you did anything wrong. That is actually what’s terrifying. You’ll continue to put women through this until you learn to love yourself.

Just like *I* continued to keep letting you do this to me because I didn’t know what love was, for me or *from* anyone else. 

Everything I just quoted from you was just a three days. It doesn’t even match everything else you said to me our entire relationship.

I want you to remember this. 

You **never**. fucking. deserved me.

✨doing this as a form of healing✨

WIBTAH. If I created a dummy account pretending  to be a foreigner to be close with his ex.,"Who else here got obsessed with your partner ex gf and the cause of the betrayal.

So for context i met my partner and wasn’t aware that he has a long term relationship. 

We started dating and they already broke up and his ex new about me that i exist but idk her yet.

Shes a single mom of 2 from 2 different guy and my partner told me that he is helping her just until she found a job cause he feels sorry for the kids.
My partner was the one who supported her financially during their six years relationship and he even sends her to college just so she can provide for her kids. She used to work at a bar and  he felt like he needed to save her . So that’s exactly what he did. But throughout the relationship shes been with many and had been in a relationship with them. While using his money. Theres one time that the girl went to vacation with a guy and that guy leaves her there. So the girls family has been contacting him and begging to send money so the girl can go home. She would also go to airbnb with a different guy or motel.  Or sometimes the guy go to her house. ( During the first year of the relationship the gilr introduced a different guy on her family while continuesly getting support from him. So he endures all that perhaps out of love. She even admitted that she has another boyfriend and was even heartbroken and suicidal that he leaves her. While apologizing to him. He wanted to leave her many times but couldn’t bc she has been blackmailing her throughout tge years that she will commit suicide if he leaves her. And theres also one time that the gilr booked a hotel and send him a picture of wrist cutting so he immediately went there and and sends the picture to his supervisor to give him permission to absent. Anyways 
She was also in deep debt that he ended paying everything including her credit card and theres one time that shes been crying and was threatening him that she will take her life if she cant pay her debt on that day bc the collection agency has been calling her. So he ended up going home in the  province travelled 5 long hours after his shift so he could get his savings amounting to 100,000  just so he could sends her the money to pay her debt.

But apparently after a week he saw the girl post that shes on vacation and was holding a new phone.  

So he asked her about her debts. The girl said i was  able to ask them to extend it after paying half . So she said i just use the money to go on vacation bc i was so stressed and I bought a new phone bc my friend did .


(Clearly she was too immature to be a mom) 
Anyway it isnt my problem i just feel bad for him.




So heres comes the time that she spends all his money already so she was back crying and being suicidal.  He really thought she would take her own life so he was really afraid.
He told her everytime to be strong for her kids and everything will be better.

He also has the chance to talk to her mom on messenger but later found out that it was her hes talking to.


And everytime he gets incentives from his work he sends her 70k to cover all her debt but somehow its still not enough bc the girl was way too young when she became a mother and is using that time to spurlge on material things with the influence of her friends and classmates.






Also to note he sends almost all his salary to her every payday to support for her kids. And sadly her kids always got sick too. ( His best friend told him if she even cares for her kids bc they always got sick and her mom was the one who always their for her kids) His best friend didn’t stop from giving advice to him that he should leave her already. But even if he want to for some reasons he just  cant.



And the girl also lied that they have a field trip and shes asking 10,000 to cover all the expenses.
Shes been begging so he ended up finding a way to get her the money.


And suddenly he thought of asking the school about the trip so he secretly messaged the school asking about the trip and he found out that there was no trip.😂

He didnt tell her but he stalk the girls fb and check her friends post and thats where he saw that the girl went to a bar with a guy along with her friends. ( note the girl doesn’t post him on fb so her friends are unaware he even existed)

And then heres comes the Graduation where he wanted to see her get on that stage bc he worked for it. But the girl doesn’t want him to. He insisted and the girl ended up giving her the address.
So he went to the address he gave her and guess what its the wrong freaking address of the graduation.😂😂😂







So after so many debts and paying for her College tuitions . he loses his savings already and ended up having a debt for himself just so he could help her pay off her debts and sends her to school. He even got to a point where he had to borrow money to his parents .


(His parents met the girl once but they dont like her with the fact that she has two kids with 2 different men.)

Anyways 

He was full aware that without money hes nothing to her.




And yet even after  knowing that he still cant leave her.
 


Almost 3 years after 
 

Up to this day 
Hes still paying the debt he got to help her pay off her bills.



So anyways  when we both had covid the girl went to his house and they ended up doing the deed bc the girl said she wanted to make it up to him.



I found out and hes been sorry he let me read all their conversations and messages just so I could understand him.

I was mad and devastated but i ended up giving him another chance. 

Dont come on  me abt my boundaries and standars for myself i know it was bad and im stupid.








Anyways  we both work and the girl even message me for support so for some reasons i agreed to support not her but her kids.

So that was like almost a year until march when she had an operation for gallstones. And she was asking us money bc she wanted to go home to see her kids cause she leave their home. Idk where she went.



So during her operation i was also at the hospital for like 10 days bc of bleeding and later on I found out i had a miscarriage. So she asked us for money again to pay the remaining balance on her hospital bill. She sends a picture of the copy of the bill covering the days of admission and thee remaining balance and the date of discharge. 
So I asked her why need to cover those important details. She claimed shes in a hospital for 3 days. But looking on the paper she forgot to cover the count of days in her room. Apparently it says there (1D semi-private. ) so she lied again and we told her  thats it.. cause shes asking like 3times of what was really on the bill. We didnt send her anymore money. That was the end of it.



While i on the other hand was grieving we both are . My partner cried and so do i and he felt extremely sorry for me.




Anyways after all that 

I dont know what happened to me but I somehow developed i think an obsession to her  .
I created a dummy account pretending to be a foreigner and sends her a friend request which she accepted immediately.
So we became close.

I asked her at first if she was single and she said yes.( i just wanted to know if she has new bf) after that i didnt messaged her again.


Months passed where she ended up getting pregnant and up to the time she brought a  beautiful baby in this world.

I messaged her again. To ask her if shes okay and the baby. And she said shes been well. But her bf leaves her again and doesn’t want the baby.(idk if its her karma after using and cheating to my bf for years) but the baby is definitely a blessing.

After few exhange messages I ended up asking her about how long was her relationship to her ex. She said it was 3 years.
So I counted and this is funny  during her relationship with my partner she was already in a relationship with this guy.

I forgot to add she got pregnant that time when she went to his house. And i put some distance cause i dont wanna hurt a baby but my partner was convincing me not to leave him bc he said he doesn’t love his ex anymore and that he can support the baby. It was hard on my part but i went with it anyway. 


The girl doesn’t want to go to a doctor that time and get herself checked.

My partner doesn’t believe her that it was his bc of her past doings and he said it was so sudden for her to go to his house. 
His thinking that it’s possible she knows she’s pregnant already bfore she went to. Bc normally they are on withdrawal and with CD but during the time the gorl told him not use CD anymore as she assure her that shes on birth control. 
So there’s doubt and theres also one time where she sends a pink pregnancy test and so googled the picture and guess what the pregnancy test she sends is exactly the same one the internet.😂

We didnt tell her about that. 
But so since she claimed she was pregnant we figured to do a Non-Invasive prenatal paternity testing as soon as 7 weeks.
The only problem we had at that time was she didn’t wanna go to hospital with him. ( I allowed him to go with her to the doctor cause she would awkward abt the situation) but she still declined to go to hospital and she was just asking for like thousands of money. She said shes been in a lot of stress bc of the bills and the kids needs and all.

So we felt we have a responsibility to her so we send her the money.
Then like 3 days she didn’t text us 
And then like 2am she told us she terminated her pregnancy.
So we were like how? And why did u do it.
She said she didn’t wanna be embarrassed again on her family for having a kid without a dad.

We cant do anything but we still supported her for the sake of her kids until her operations which was the finall straw of her lies.


So 3 years after knowing there was a man shes in a relationship with at the same time she was with my partner.
I couldnt help but wonder if the baby is his / bc she refuses to go a doctor to find out how many weeks she’s pregnant.

And if she was even really pregnant bc of the pregnancy test that was on google.


Anyways i just feel bad for what my partner went trough.






Anyways going back to which  i asked her  about the father of the baby. And i told her I asked you months ago if you were single and you said yes .how are you in a 3 years relationship with someone. She didn’t answer.

I also asked if she ever cheated. She replied with im afraid of karma.

I even ask her if she ever terminated a pregnancy or why she didn’t aborted the baby.
She replied with never cause im afraid of the karma and baby is a blessing.

Fastforward 

And now she shares some of her problems to me (my dummy ) and i always end up comforting her.telling her shes the best mom and that im proud of her.
And that shes beautiful and doesn’t have to feel insecure bc shes pretty. I always boost her confidence.
Tho i know shes only talking to me cause she thought she can get money from me.( she already asked to which I replied that i just paid my apartment and car and had to see a therapist.😂😂😂😂.



IS THIS NORMAL I KNOW THIS ISNT REDDIT PLEASE HELP ME.


Btw my partner has been great to me for the past years. 
Hes been a great provider. I dont work after i was was diagnosed with severe depression and been admitted for weeks in the hospital for trying to unalive myself.ive been on medication for 2 years now. Im 4months sober from Sh i had relapsed. Its a continuous battle and what happened really did traumatized me. But hey i deserve what I tolerate right.😂🤦🏾‍♀️.
And he doesn’t force me to work since he knows im not ready. I tried to applied last year but during the orientation and training cant stop to throw up and feel nauseous and even shaking. And just tjis january when i tried to eat alone at a fastfood at the mall  it was crowded i feel nauseous and sick and i went out and throw up infront of a lot of people.it was so embarrassing. My partner says to take it slowly until i get used again of doing what I usually do . Bfore all this trauma . He also tracks my medication and make sure i take it on time  .sometimes i lie that i take my meds but he knows  i did not cause he tracked it. He also doesn’t require me to so much chores .just cooking and sweep the floor bc he understand that there are days that its hard for me to the chores. Hes the one who washed my clothes even on my red days. He also doesn’t shout or got mad at me for red stains on bed sheet instead he says its normal for girls and that i shouldnt feel bad. When i was at my lowest with everything happened and the passing of my dad from covid. I couldn’t clean myself for days so hes the one who cleaned me up and shower me. Hes been very understanding of what i went through . He doesn’t buy me flowers but he always make sure i get to my cravings specially during red days. And he listens to me even when his already sleepy he said my reddit stories is his bed time story.😂
And he try to remember it cause i sometimes unaware that im telling him a story which he already knew cause i told it already many times.

I love hearing reddit stories from @beyondbeautiful on tiktok.

so I love my partner he had made a mistake and i forgive him. He was sorry for all the trauma he had put me throu. We live together for years already and he has been in out of the past years. And just last year he had an operation for kidney stone. And just this month he was food poison. So we were in the hospital for days. Anyways we’re doing okay now. 


I might have irrelevant info to what I initially wanted to ask and I would apologize.  I cant help it it happens everytime i tell a story it messy even other  people says that too esp my partner  i tend to rambles so i might have cause confusions.






Anyway

WOULD I BE THE ASSHOLE FOR  CREATING A DUMMY ACC TO STALK HIS EX.






Thankyou to whoever read this . I know its very long. So thankyou for taking the time.

WIBTAH for leaving my wife because she witheld her pregnancy?,"I (33M) have been dating my wife (34F) for 4 years and we've been married for 2 years. When we first started dating, I explicitly said that I do not want kids. I have ADHD and I cannot raise them well. A few days ago she told me that she was 18 weeks pregnant, and claims she just found out. However, I recently discovered from my BIL that she had known for two months, and worse, told everyone, from her friends, to her family, except me. It's already bad enough that she withheld her pregnancy from me, but lying was even worse. 

I confronted her about the situation, and she told me she only lied because of the abortion laws. I told her that we could have just moved to a state where abortion was legal, but she didn't want to leave her life behind. I told her that she knew that I had ADHD and that it would be hard for me to raise kids, and that this I was gonna file for divorce. She begged me not to leave her and promised she'll move to a state where abortion laws were less strict, but I told her that it wasn't the pregnancy, it was the fact she lied to me, and I didn't want to be married to someone that lies to their spouse, especially over serious decisions like pregnancy.

I'm currently staying at a motel. Almost everyone said I was right, but a select few people, such as her parents, said I was wrong for leaving her at a serious time.

AITAH for being “controlling” with my teenage daughter?,"I (38F) have a daughter (16F) who’s alternative along with a lesbian. I personally have no problem with her choice of style or lover I think it’s cool. Recently she’s seen a bunch of new styles in Pinterest that do look cool but I don’t want her damaging her natural hair so, after some talking we agreed on I get her good quality heat resistant synthetic wigs with the colors she wants and she gets to cut them and style them as she chooses. My sister in law isn’t the best person to put it lightly, she was raised in a no rules house and allows her daughter to do the same.

We had a family get together at my mother’s house and she wore one of the wigs she styled. It had a layered wolf cut with crazy colors, everyone else loved is minus my sister in law. She went up to her and asked where she went to get it done and my daughter told her it was a wig she did herself (with a little of my help since I’m a hair stylist) and my sister in law looked at me like I was crazy. She began berating me about why I wouldn’t let her do it to her real hair. My daughter has very long thick hair and I want to keep it that way until she’s 18 and she can do whatever with it and my daughter agrees with me. I told her that I wanted to keep it healthy and allow my daughter to be able to do what she wants with her hair at the same time. She began to call me controlling and bitter (I don’t know what I have to be bitter about) so I brung up the fact her daughter has no rules and the fact she was running crazy just like her (her daughter is currently pregnant AGAIN and plans to keep this one instead of aborting like they last one) she began screaming at me to stay out of her business. I told her the same, took some food and left with my daughter.

A few weeks later my daughter and her lover were in my daughters room cuddling as they usually did when my sister in law came over, I reluctantly let her in and she practically ran upstairs to my daughters room and took pictures of her and her girlfriend, and threatened to out them (my family knows and doesn’t care, it’s my sister in laws family that’s conservative) I told her to do as she pleased and leave. Now once she left I let my daughters girlfriends parents know and they were greatly unhappy with my sister in law and now refuses to let her lover come to family events if there not there which is understandable and my daughter understands but is still upset. My sister in law is going crazy over it and how it’s not getting the reaction out of anyone as her daughter gets into more trouble

[REQUEST] what is my ideology,"Economy:I believe that taxation is theft and anybody should be able to sell whatever they want. I think that our current system is unfair and big corporations mistreat workers and i belive that we need a revolution to change our corporatist world. I dont believe in regulating small buisnesses however i want to destroy big buisnesses and want complete equality of both wealth and oppurtunity
Cultural issues:I believe that some races are superior over others and that ethnostates are the way to go.If people refuse to leave then we must remove them by force.We should definitely ban immigration of all kinds  or our country will fail
Social issues:I believe that we should all be gay as woman are disgusting and we should remove them from our country unless they become trans(FtM) how ever MtF should be illegal as woman are disgusiting creatures. On rhe issue of abortion i am split as i dont want anymore people to be born but i dont like the idea of woman having a choice. I want everyone to have guns and sell guns. If you disobey our laws you will be killed
Goverment:i unironnically believe in anarcho monarchy as i want to topple the goverment and destroy it however i want a monarch(preferably my self) to rule over the land and slaughter people against our cause) The monarch will enforce the law in our stateless society. 
Foreign policy: i believe that we shpuld attack our neighbors but no further than that as we shall focus on ourselves 
I am kind of a communist as i want to secure workers rights but also kind of capitalist as i like small buisnesses and want no taxation.I am queer but i would consider myself an ethnonationalist.

I'm pregnant and afraif,"I’m pregnant and the other woman of 2 years

I was reading here through my main account, I made a new one, so no one can find my identity.  
Also, I'm not a native English speaker, and on my phone, so sorry if I make any grammar or formatting  errors. 

I am a 26yo woman, in a relationship with MM who’s 34, married for 14years to his wife (same age, HS sweethearts). 

We met through work, at first it was just innocent talking, but we found out that we have so much in common. Slowly we fell in love, and two years ago, our relationship turned physical.  
His home life is hard. Wife is a SAHM, their kids are 14 and 12yo girls. Sometimes he vents about her, but then he states that he can't leave her, cuz he is the breadwinner and the courts in this country give full custody to mothers and fathers to become weekend dads, while paying 50% of their income as support.  
We agreed to wait until the youngest turned 18, then became official (in this way, their mother can’t force the weekend dad role on him and can't claim his house) 

I was okay with it. We meet up 3-4 times a week in my apartment, we cook together, he fixes stuff that needs to be fixed. I'm a homebody, I don't care that we can't go on public dates.  
Everything was perfect.  
Today, I went to my yearly checkup, and I wanted to change my birth control implant (it should have been good for the next three months, but I wanted to be sure)  we'll, turned out, that I’m 10 weeks pregnant.  
I'm shocked. I didn't have any symptoms. Then I remembered a story here, where MM just ghosted OW after she got pregnant. I'm so afraid this is going to happen to me, but im sure I don't want an abortion (had one when I was a teen, and it was traumatic)  
I have to tell him, I know it's a must.

"29 [M4F] #College Station, Texas/Anywhere - Catholic Engineer Searching for His Trad-Wife Soulmate","Howdy!

My names John and I'm a 29 year old nuclear engineer in Texas who is a devout Catholic, values traditional gender roles, and is seeking a like-minded woman to build a family with.

**About me:**

Appearance-wise, I am a 6'1"", white man with brown hair, a full beard, hazel eyes, and an average physique. I typically wear jeans, boots, and a collared shirt. For my career, I currently work full time as the Associate Director of a nuclear research facility while also finishing my PhD in nuclear engineering. After my PhD, I plan to pursue a career in research at one of the national labs, so likely will move to Tennessee or Idaho. Being born and raised in Texas, I am definitely a bit country with an accent that really comes out when I'm around family. I have fairly traditional values, especially when it comes to marriage and the roles of husband and wife (more on that below), and I value family greatly. I converted to Catholicism last November and go to Mass every Sunday, sometimes even daily. As for political leanings, I am definitely a conservative, in particular against abortion and ""woke"" social movements. Also definitely not a feminist. I am also a bit of a nerd, ramble on about physics, and make terrible puns/dad jokes all the time. 

**What I'm looking for:**

I am looking to start settling down with someone with similar values and to build a family with her over the next couple of years. My goal and ideal lifestyle would be to eventually buy some land, build a home exactly how we want it together, and to start homesteading with a garden and maybe some animals. Once we have kids (hopefully 4+), I prefer to homeschool them and raise them with traditional Catholic values. I truly believe that men and women have roles to play in a relationship and marriage, both incredibly important and beautiful in their own right. As a man, I want to provide for and protect my family, to take care of any of the more hard labor things around the home, and to be the even-keeled, dominant head of the household. And likewise, I expect my wife to be a caring, nurturing, more emotionally driven homemaker and housewife, who takes care of the home when I'm away, keeps pushing me closer to God, and trusts in my love and leadership.

**Ideal partner:**

Ideally, I am looking for a white woman my age or younger, who is Catholic (or at least open to Catholicism), conservative, and naturally submissive. Definitely looking for someone who is in touch with her feminine side, who wears cute dresses and skirts often (I'm a sucker for sundresses), veils in church, and has a bit of silly, playful side to her personality. Bonus points if you're a bit nerdy or have some quirky interests! I'm also open minded to kinks, just figured that's more for a different converstation. Above all though, I want someone who is dedicated and looking for longterm.

If you're a woman who shares similar values and is interested in building a longterm, loving relationship, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to message me if you'd like to get to know each other better. In your message, tell me a bit about yourself and include a picture.

Looking forward to hearing from you.",1b1cg7j,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1b1cg7j,[]

Why does US not have string public lobby around maternity?,"I have a question for American parents here because I'm honestly baffled.

To set what is norm for me: I am from Czechia, our maternity is for 6 months where you get paid like 70% of your pay and then we get additional parental leave till age 3 where not only you get preset amount of stipend during that time ($15k total over 30 month period) but your employer also can't fire you and has to give you your job back after those 3 years. So basically every woman in my country once she has a baby she becomes a temporary SAHM on government support (there's talk about splitting with dads we're not there yet). It is absolutely unthinkable you wouldn't stay with your child for at least 2 years. So when I hear about daycare for infants it's kinda jarring and saddening.

Personally I think this is super generous and we have one of the longer parental stays in EU. I'm not expecting US  parents to go"" ""full commie"" like this.

But...I hear about healthcare issues, abortion rights, I hear about police reforms, gun laws, I hear about rents, even crazy daycare costs...yet maternity? Nothing?

Why is this not high on democrat's agenda? It seems absolutely essential in this day and age to be able to actually care for your baby with some sense of security. But I don't really hear any voices demanding this. It would lessen the burden on single parents so much too.

He implied that I am undesirable and gave me a list of plastic surgeries he wanted me to get on my face (literally every single fucking facial feature, he wanted fixed) ""to become attractive so men will be interested in you"". As if I wasn't attractive already. He keeps talking about my romantic life, first saying I was single because men didn't want me, then saying I am being single because I am too picky, or saying ""a man doesn't need to be rich or handsome, he just doesn't have to abuse you"". He said things to me like ""a bad husband is better than no husband"".

Anyway, my sister (not my dad's kid, someone else's) got knocked up and abandoned by her ex boyfriend. My dad used to make comments on my sister's appearance, such as her having platinum blond hair and long fake nails - the nails she only tried ONCE and posted on social media and its like my dad just tunnel visioned into that to make a whole character judgment on her. He said something about the women of her race being low standards and commonly single mothers, and then sided with the exBF saying he has no guarantee that the child is even his. Dad started blaming her for not aborting, saying she ""chose"" to be a single mom as if the guy had no part in it, then said my sister was probably sleeping around with other people.

Me: what makes you think she was sleeping with other people?

Dad: You know, kids in your generation. They're into casual sex and hookups, we weren't like that in my generation.

Me, knowing it's bullshit because dad liked to brag about banging girls during his college days: Oh so it's a generational thing. Do you think I am sleeping with a bunch of people then? What are you saying, dad?

Dad: Well not you, you don't seem like someone who dates or has a lot of guys hanging around her

Oh. Hah. I used to be paid hundreds of dollar an hour to be dined and wined (sex itself is only a short amount of time), been with a lot of guys, and I work with a bunch of guys at the regular job who go out of their way to spend time with me.

Got you something ,"So when I was 19 I almost got baby trapped. As in, guy got me pregnant, decided he wanted to be a dad, wanted to marry me, etc. etc. but also didn't want to do the work of becoming a father by providing housing or anything for me. You know. ""Let's keep this baby but also go stay with your mom."" I had told him my trauma about having had an abortion already once before and expressed that I didn't want to be pregnant again unless I was in a place to keep it. 

Cue my mom's take- You're not ready to be a mom (fair) You're going to be a horrible mom (really?) Why don't you just get back on drugs and go back to wasting your life away, you sorry excuse for a daughter? (okay, maybe dial it back). In her defense, I'd only been clean for the past few months at that point. But I digress. I was starting to lose my shit. This was right after Roe v Wade was overturned so I got online and scheduled an appointment at the clinic in Chicago, packed up my car, and disappeared. 

I made a pit stop to pick up adult diapers and things like that, and as the bleeding started (IYKYK) I had a brilliant idea occur to me. After a 3-4 day trip in the heat of June it seemed perfect just to sum up all the bullshit I'd been through at that point. 

I arrived back home late at night, went to bed, and got up the next morning to make myself breakfast and say good morning to my parents. FYI, my mom works from home. So I stopped by her in-home office and gave her a Walmart bag with the first bloody adult diaper I had used to carry my (since ended) pregnancy. It smelled absolutely rank.

The nurses were SO kind and the doctor was informative and quick. I arrived at the hospital, here in Canada the clinics are in the hospital, checked in and took an antibiotic orally and then got an iv put in my arm where you\'d get blood drawn. I waited 25 minutes and then changed into a gown. I walked across the hall with a nurse and sat up on the operating room chair .. it was like a reclined dentist chair. I kept my knees bent and they asked me to say my name and date of birth. Then the nurse administered the twilight sedation which was very strong. The doctor inserted a tool to hold open my vagina and then put two needles of freezing into my cervix which was like pressure but no pain. Just felt uncomfortable. The nurse held my hand. Her name was Pam - so kind. The doctor did a PAP test, sti test and aspiration method within literally 6 minutes. Then she told me she was going to do a vaginal ultrasound and because I was drugged up I said ""you better lube that thing up first"" and they both laughed. Then Pam helped me put on mesh underwear and a pad and I literally walked with her to the recovery  room. I sat up the whole time. Chatted with another nurse, drank an entire can of gingerale and then 45 minutes later I walked myself down to the main floor and my boyfriend picked me up. I napped at home, hard for 2 hours, woke up and ate. My bleeding was SO light. Like lighter than a period. And it lasted for about a week, off and on but not enough to wear a pad just a liner. I had sex 4 days after the procedure as my boyfriend is gentle and understanding and he\'s always checking in on me physically and emotionally. \nI promise that the worst part of this journey is waiting for the procedure. Remind yourself you\'re in good hands, they will ensure to get all the contents out and within 3 days after the procedure you\'ll feel better physically. As for the emotional part, it was rocky for about 5 days after. Mainly because the hormones are going up and down a lot. Just remind yourself it\'ll pass and you did make the right decision in the moment ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️', ""I had opted for an SA 2 months ago for the same reason. My procedure went so well that I was shocked at how easygoing the process and aftermath was. I did mine at a Planned Parenthood. It took about 2 hours to do the ultrasound, intake forms, and waiting before the actual procedure. The nurses and doctor were all great in making me feel as comfortable as possible. I opted for twilight sedation (I didn't want to be fully knocked out) but ended up knocking out anyways and woke up getting wheelchaired out. I was pretty early on so the bleeding afterwards wasn't too heavy. I think I was lightly spotting for around 3 days before it stopped. The breast tenderness stopped after a week or two. I expected to be an emotional wreck for a bit after but was again surprised at how fine I felt. Since then, I've teared up a couple times just letting myself grieve over the situation. I don't regret my choice at all and am so extremely grateful it went as smoothly as it did. Agreed with another commenter that the worst part is the waiting. I hope your procedure goes just as smoothly!""]"

HOWEVER it gives you a clear conscious.\n\n\n\n- If you don\'t tell him, you won\'t wake any sleeping birds, HOWEVER be prepared to take this secret to the grave with you. Are you able to hide this secret from him lets say 10 - 20 years down the line if it gets more serious? Are you able to hide this from him if you ever marry him? And I doubt he\'d be happy if you tell him this years later.\n\nAnd IF you hide it, tell NOBODY about your abortion. Not your mom, not your BFF. This secret should NEVER leak by some third party. If this ever leaks out I\'d imagine he\'d be pretty mad.\n\n\nI\'d say telling the truth is the least muddy option. If the abortion will cause a lot of blowback than so be it. In the end ut is your womb, so your decision. But I can imagine you don\'t want to risk it.\n\nPlan every scenario out in your head. Find out what his takes on abortions. And prepare for the consequences of either choice.\n\nIf he is just someone you\'re ""just dating"" I wouldn\'t bother.', ""You shouldn't tell him, but you also shouldn't continue with him. He would be better off for it."", 'Don’t tell him just abort it', ""I wouldn't tell him. Not now nor never. I don't see the point of it."", ""I'd tell him before you abort.  Not to consult him, but to gauge his reaction.  If he supports whatever decision you make, that relationship is worth pursuing potentially.  If he pressures you one way or the other, then....maybe not and you can cut your losses."", 'The amount of people saying don’t bother, DOES NOT sit well with me. Anyone involved NEEDS to know.', 'I think he has a right to know', 'naw, you’ve known him a month and a half. flush it out and ghost him.', ""You'll need someone with you to go through with it. To mitigate risk. In my mind it should be him, the two of you put you in this position. \n\nIf you do not require or want his assistance, what purpose in telling him though? As you said it makes no difference to your decision and may stir up feelings for him. \n\nIf you need/want his support going through the termination, tell him.\nIf you don't, don't."", ""I think you should be honest and tell him. Let's say that you don't and the relationship evolves into something serious later. Wouldn't it be shocking to find out that earlier on, he got you pregnant? I'm aware that it is your body. Nevertheless, he's still entitled to have a call on it, as part of him as well.""]"
