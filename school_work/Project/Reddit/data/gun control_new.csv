Primary Weapons Application,"So I had a thought today on how I keep hearing about the Breaker and its meta. I am not one to play the meta, and look to see how weapons are applied. So here are some impressions for what I see the weapons have and have not in their corner.

This won't have all weapons, as I haven't unlocked everything yet, and MY particular playstyle is precision focused.

Liberator - standard flexible weapon. Can take on lights and the scope gives some range to reach far targets easier. Precise bursts can make some mediums realize they met their match.

Liberator Penetrator - added punch through to make Devastators and Hive Guard regret standing against Managed Democracy. Slightly less effective against unarmored targets if not going for precision hit spots.

Liberator Explosive - no AOE, but the keyword seems to help in some precision strikes. Limited mileage however since I taken it off someone else.

Knight - Buzz saw in one hand. Burst for the lights, and a rip and tear to light armored medium targets. Regrettably low ammo efficiency if not on burst. Clear red dot for good use.

Defender - Slow, but snappy. Nice for an SSD pickup or a SDW when using a heavy support weapon. Enough ammo for (almost) everyone you meet.

Diligence - A personal favorite. Snappy sight and gun movement and good enough ammo reserves. Rewards precision with one body shot to raiders and two head shots to devastators, but really needs to keep tapping the medium bugs and berserker mobs.

Diligence Counter Sniper - For those who want to reach out and touch someone without taking a Support Weapon. Sight is replaced with an AMR range scope for long range shots. Increased power gives more reliable one shots to minor enemies. Trades out some ammo and a slower sight paralax and hip fire adjustment, making it less reliable in a pinch. I keep hearing rumor it may have medium piercing, but I haven't thoroughly tested it.

Punisher - standard pump action with a proven track record of ending a problem it is pointed at. Some precision needed to end mediums, but the power is there. Nice red dot for clear aiming. Ammo can disappear quickly for a long reload after.

Punisher Slugger - punishment in medium penetration form. Needs more accuracy, but feels good to slug it out with Devastators and Hive Guard. Pair up with a hand buzz saw side arm or crowd control Support Weapon in case the tubes run empty.

Breaker - Weeds out lights and somehow even makes Devastators wince and fall over fast. Good enough ammo for general use and has a tight enough spread and low recoil for the damage it doles out per round. Snappy aim makes it good up close and red dot is clear enough for mid range 00 buck shot.

Breaker Incindiary - Tried it off of a dead battle buddy. Wide spread is built in to make sure Willy Pete finds its way into a crowd. Kinda slow to end their suffering, but every enemy of Managed Democracy suffers a little when hit by this.

Breaker Spray and Pray - Much less effective than I wish it to be. Any type of armor covering stops the wide spread of bird shot, and is the only weapon I know of that deflects pellets off of Hive Guard sides and Brood Commanders entirely. Reliable kills only after pumping 4-5 rounds out against weaker raider boys, making it show that its extra ammo is not a strength or compensation compared to its other varients. Also has a slower snap to aim when turning, making it less useful up close where it should be.

Scythe - Good memories from the first Helldivers. Infinite ammo if not overheating, and the Energy Based keyword seems to give it a pass against medium armor. Not time efficient, but good for a burn theough of some enemies in between uses of Support Weapons and side arms.

Scorcher - No flexibility modes or scope, but useful as an energy explosive. The only one of the primaries where distance is your friend and a side arm is necessary when they are at arm's reach. The explosive effect grinds down mediums and even scout walkers with ease. Ammo count is a bit low, but a satisfying weapon regardless because of its wide reach of targets it can manage to remove. 

Dominator - aka The bolter. Explosive and able to handle medium armor, but not vehicles. Ammo is good enough for small crowds, and is safe(?) to use up close unlike the scorcher. Seems to have a bullet speed slower than average, making long shots harder.

What are your thoughts of these?",1b1iy0f,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1b1iy0f/primary_weapons_application/,[]

Anarcho Capitalism vs Crypto Anarchy,"In this post, Simplified Privacy will compare Anarcho Capitalism, Crypto Anarchy, and Agorism, so you can more easily find relevant resources to improve your knowledge and skills.

Anarcho Capitalism (abbreviated AnCap) is an openly advertised political movement that promotes free markets and an abolition of the state. Most AnCaps will OPENLY tell you they are part of this movement, and it shares many similarities with Libertarians. Libertarians and AnCaps only really differ on should the government run a socialized police force and army.

Crypto Anarchy (also called CypherPunk) is usually a SECRET lifestyle, where one rejects the concept of external government control and instead chooses individual self-sovereignty. This concept of freedom and subverting the power of the state, is often expressed through the use of privacy and encryption technology, cryptocurrencies, and even frequently traveling to other countries with multiple passports to reduce a single government’s control over the individual.

The main difference between Anarcho Capitalism (AnCap) and Crypto Anarchy (CypherPunk) is that AnCaps organize politically to encourage voting, while as Crypto Anarchy involves using technology to subvert the system. This could involve creating code to defy surveillance, trading cryptocurrency without regulations, not using left-wing social media platforms, or even some type of “illegal market” depending on who you ask. Although I personally think drug markets degrades the core philosophies from more wide-spread acceptance. Fearing being oppressed for their actions, CypherPunks place a much greater emphasis on privacy and open source than AnCaps.

The AnCap says to the CypherPunk, “How can you not vote?! We need you!”
The CypherPunk says to the AnCap, “How can you register to vote? You’re telling the NSA where you live?!”

How does Crypto Anarchy differ from Agorism?

Agorism is a general term for economics and a parallel society outside the control of government institutions. Like a CypherPunk, Agoras don’t think the voting will help. Instead of voting, Agorism focuses on individual entrepreneurship to add value to the community and fix yourself first.

Agoras differ from CypherPunks, in that Agoras usually aren’t as tech-savvy, but look to get outside the system through other means, such as growing their own food. For example “Sal the Agorist” is a popular Twitter account promoting gun ownership and growing your own food, but he sells ads for his Twitter account using a Gmail.

So a CypherPunk says to an Agorist “How can you use Big Tech?”
While an Agorist says to a CypherPunk “How can you eat Big Ag?”

Summarize each:

Anarcho Capitalism (AnCap)
Let’s spread the message of freedom through education, and vote to be free.
Logic and reason are the pillars upon which we build objective morality.

Agorism
Society will not change. Using cryptocurrencies we can create a parallel economy and community, to fix ourselves first.

Crypto-Anarchy (CypherPunk)
I was born free, and you can’t stop me from using encryption to stay free. Big Tech is the government’s puppet for surveillance and censorship.

What is the purpose of this? Are you going try to convince me to join?

No, I can’t convince you to become a Crypto Anarchist. You have to self-realize it on your own.

"My character died and I do not feel motivated to get back into the game, am I being unreasonable?","**IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
We are all first or second time players, including the DM so some poor play is to be expected and I believe everyone is really giving it their all, so I don't hold any hard feelings towards anyone here. We are all friends.  


For starters, last session two of our players couldn't make it so we were sitting at 3 out of 5 party members, we decided to proceed anyway as this session was intended to be more ""chill"". A quick rundown of the story is that we're just arriving at this town after ensuring that a caravan could make it safely. We decide to write our friends' absence by saying they got really injured during our previous battle and needed medical attention, so we left them at the town medic for the duration of the game. Leaving only rogue fighter and alchemist (me!) in our party.  


First day was uneventful enough, we all decided to take some time for ourselves doing things we personally found interesting. Seeing as I wanted to use my artificer infusions I asked for my party's weapons, something they complied with and we all went on our way. During the night I went over my flavoring for said infusions, I infused the rogue's flintlock with repeating shot (Flavored as modifying the gun's mechanism so that pulling the trigger would douse the pellets with a magical fluid that would make them teleport back to the douse position after a couple of seconds) and the fighter's great sword with enhanced weapon (An ointment developed using a similar reaction to my feather falling potions, making the weapon lighter and easier to wield).   


Come the next day I showed off my work and explained in character what the upgrades were, something that took me quite a bit of time to come up with given that I'm not that great at roleplaying yet. Everyone seemed to find it really cool! all nice and good here.  


Rogue brings up what he was up to the previous day, he spoke with some men at the tavern who claimed to have seen a fish that was THIS big, something which greatly interested the rogue. He decided to go check it out, late in the day, all on his own. Upon using the bait the fish attacked him for 12 damage (Quite harsh given we are all level 3s at this point!) and he retreats after this. He asks us if we would accompany him this time.  


Now, in lore my character is very fond of rogue, rogue is a well known detective with an impressive ability to solve problems quickly, something my character is super impressed by and causes him to see rogue as a mentor of sorts. Clearly, my character would not let rogue go alone towards something potentially dangerous so having him pass on this is out of the picture.  


Even in character I mention how ""perhaps we should wait for our other party members to be in good health before pursuing this fish"", something I also bring up out character. The other players bring up that they can't really think of anything else to do at the moment (We asked if there was any noteworthy places in the town and there was not) and that this sounded pretty interesting, I yield and go with them.  


The fight with the fish was admittedly lucky, having later learned it had 16 AC and around 100 HP. At the start of the battle, fighter asked my character if he had any more vials of the flintlock magical fluid on me, to which I said yes. He threw a vial at the fish, causing a good chunk of it to teleport back and dealing a lot of damage, 25 or so, if I remember correctly, also opening up a weak spot for us to attack. This was quite inspiring and it made for a really cool moment! We all kept wailing on the fish and got a crit here and there, the fight was looking winnable. On the last turn however, it uses an AOE dex saving throw attack on fighter and I, which we both end up going down to (I later learned this was a 4d6 of damage attack, he was on 9 HP and I was on 16 HP at that moment) leaving us in the unconscious state and in need of help, fish is low however, so rogue finishes it off, all well and good.   


At this point, I had failed two of my death saving throws back to back whereas fighter passed two in a row, DM communicates this by mentioning that my state does not look good at all. Despite that, rogue opts to stabilize fighter first, arguing he was closer to him passing up on two opportunites to help me up. unfortunately, I end up missing the check on my 4th roll and I die.  


It felt so strange.  I had grown incredibly attached to this character in between sessions. Thinking up of situations he might find himself in, how he would react and some stories he would share with the party. I had been writing a little journal of his travels from his own perspective as well and spent quite a bit going over level up skills from my own class and my party's looking for out for any potential syngery and flavor ideas for my abilities and spells, I was really so invested!  


And he ended up dying right then and there, session 7, day 4 in lore. My party had lost someone they never really got to meet, a character who never got to realize himself, change, learn. I never got to work on any in game personal projects I had in mind, I feel like I didn't even really get to play the character at all. It was all incredibly unsatisfying. When asked about revival, DM mentioned that it would be hard to come by in this world and that it wouldn't happen soon, so that's out of the question.  


Fighter got super pissed at the rogue in game, actually really getting into the RPing aspect of the game and having a little breakdown. He later mentioned that this really got him invested into the story.  


I mentioned after the session was over that I would roll up a new character, but honestly? I don't see myself being able to pour anywhere near as much time or effort into another character in the near future. How could I possibly get attached when it can all end this way, this soon? Maybe I didn't play the fight perfectly, but I wasn't going out of my way to be reckless, I feel like I mainly died to bad luck, factors completely outside of my control.  


It has been really bothering me the last few days, I even had a hard time sleeping the night it happened, probably a little excessive for a make belief game, but I digress. Even though I told everyone I would make a new character I don't feel anywhere near as invested in the game as I did a few days ago, and I'm tempted to not even make a comeback at all. I fear that this might break the group apart, however, make people blame themselves, something I really do not want.  


I'm not sure what to do next, if I do make another character, it'll probably end up being a two dimensional person, something which would pale in comparison to my first, and if I leave the campaign might very well disband, it's in a kind of a strange state after this happened.   


I'm not really sure what to do about this. I made this post because I would like to hear other people's opinions in the matter, though I want to remind you all that this is all coming from my perspective alone, try and look at this with that in mind.

Op-Ed: Services cut to taxpayers to pay for illegal non-immigrants,"Illegal aliens rest at a makeshift shelter in Denver, Jan. 6, 2023. Five mayors from around the U.S. want a meeting with President Joe Biden to ask for help controlling the continued arrival of large groups of illegal aliens to their cities. The mayors of Denver, Chicago, Houston, New York and Los Angeles say in a letter to Biden that there has been little to no coordination, support or resources and that is leading to a crisis.

""The economic impact of illegal immigration on taxpayers is catastrophic."" – Ric Keller

When a group of 77 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to President Joe Biden recently criticizing his open border policies, this was the first major criticism by Democrats over Biden's attempts to cram their cities with illegal aliens. This came as a reaction to big city Democrats who were trying to meet their budgets for next year. They found there was no way that they could continue providing the same services to their legal constituents and still pay out big bucks to support Biden's illegal non-immigrants too.

As millions of Americans pay taxes this week, Biden is rolling out the welcome mat for lawbreakers at their expense. There is no greater pain than to watch Biden cut checks from our hard-earned tax dollars to spend on hotel bills, debit cards and cell-phones for illegal non-immigrants who snuck across our border. Biden is treating the illegal crossers like welcomed U.S. tourists, instead of law-violating criminals.

Biden's latest fiscal budget cuts funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement by 8%. He increased funding by 700% for processing centers, flights and busing to transport these illegal non-immigrants all around the U.S. The guy who is supposed to keep bad guys out has created his own travel agency.

""Everything is under control at the border. Our plan is working. Just give it a chance."" – Joe Biden

Biden declared through an executive order he is ending all punishment for those sneaking into the country. He now prefers to call this “irregular” migration. The feds are phasing out all temporary facilities that use to detain illegal non-immigrants. Once apprehended, they are fingerprinted and handed an Order of Release on Recognizance, granting them a legal right to travel anywhere in the United States.

While open-border Democrats ignore the enormous toll on Americans of higher taxes, overcrowded classrooms, ERs, housing shortages and increased violent crime, someone's got to pay for what Biden created. Since nobody has offered to pay his bills for him, he's ""volunteered"" the American taxpayers.

""I think when you spread the wealth around it's good for everybody."" – Barack Obama

Border states have long been overwhelmed by debt from illegal non-immigrants. It costs California $21.76 billion and Texas $8.88 billion annually in education, healthcare, law enforcement, plus welfare and more. These illegal aliens are magnets for violent crime and U.S. taxpayers pay the bills to imprison them.

When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used local funds to fly illegal aliens into blue states, Democrats blasted him for trying to score “political points” with taxpayers. DeSantis retorted, ""The $12 million that financed these flights was only a tiny portion of the money Florida was spending on illegals.""

DeSantis noted since it was Democratic sanctuary states who brought these illegal aliens here its their obligation to shelter them.

“We've welcomed many Cubans to our state who've contributed to our growth and prosperity. This is Biden's problem to solve, not Florida's problem."" – Ron DeSantis

For Democrat-led cities and states, similar illegal alien flights arranged to blue states have made it very clear what the actual price of dealing with floods of illegal aliens costs taxpayers. It has been a three year nightmare for blue states trying to support all the illegal aliens Biden has shipped to blue states across America. Now to meet their budgets, they are forced to cut services to the taxpayers. Because of their distance from the border, Democratic blue states felt insulated from the border state problems. But considering the droves of illegal aliens Biden has allowed to settle throughout the country, the ever-increasing costs to support them has become a problem for all Americans.

New York, a sanctuary city, spent $8 million a day this year to care for illegal aliens, including housing some 3,000 illegal foreign families in hotels for hundreds of dollars a night. In Massachusetts where liberal cities like Boston and Cambridge have proclaimed themselves sanctuaries, they spent millions in tax dollars to expand shelter systems to house illegal non-immigrants. This cost taxpayers over $140 million so far.

Several Democratic states, including California, Illinois, and New York, have expanded access for illegal aliens to social programs like Medicaid, welfare, food stamps, and Section 8 housing. And now they face budget-busting unanticipated bills as word gets out they're giving illegal non-immigrants a free ride.

As more illegal aliens move north, the immigration conversation in Democratic cities is changing. Mayor Eric Adams of New York City said the city is being “destroyed by the illegal alien crisis.” He has complained that Biden “failed” the city and he has demanded federal aid to pay for this crisis. In the interim, Adams is trying to coax arriving illegal aliens into other suburban New York communities.

Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, fell into disfavor with other far left governors with his controversial plan early in 2023 when he joined the Republicans in busing illegal aliens out-of-state. He sent them to Democrat-run states and cities such as New York and Chicago.

""We must say no to illegal immigration so we can continue to say yes to legal immigration."" – Bill Clinton

Last year, Oregon passed legislation establishing the Universal Representation Fund, providing $15 million in “free” legal services and representation for illegal aliens facing deportation. This year, New Jersey will spend $15 million to provide healthcare benefits and lunches to illegal alien children.

Because of Biden’s open-border policies, crimes by illegal aliens have soared over the past two years in every conceivable category. This includes homicide, manslaughter, robbery, theft, sexual assault and drug trafficking. There is also a massive increase in gang activity throughout America.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested 1,142 illegal aliens who were convicted of assault, battery or domestic violence; 1,614 who were convicted of driving under the influence; and 2,239 were convicted of drug possession and trafficking. Additionally, CBP has arrested 62 illegal aliens convicted of homicide and manslaughter and 365 convicted of sexual offenses and sex trafficking.

Ronald Reagan told us, ""A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation."" On his first day in office, Biden eliminated border enforcement, terminating 89 successful border policies within a year. This dropped the number of illegal non-immigrants detained from 11,000 to 3,000 a month, the lowest since 1,999. Under Biden we have the highest number of illegal aliens entering the U.S. per day in our history!

We don’t have a country if we don’t have a border. No nation can survive if it has open borders and a welfare state to support a population who sees it as a place that has everything they want and all that they need is theirs for the taking – no questions asked. America is sadly becoming the land of the free lunches and the home of the illegal non-immigrants instead of the land of the free and home of the brave!

""Hey! This is the sheriff you’re talking about, with a gun and badge that enforces the law. Nothing is going to stop me from cracking down on illegal immigration as long as the law is there."" – Joe Arpaio
",1b1hktc,0,9,https://www.thecentersquare.com/opinion/article_74a82e0c-d263-11ee-9a0c-7ba78054d2c7.html,"['I can only roll my eyes so hard, this is too much', ""The problems that people ascribe to illegal immigration are, in my opinion, more accurately the result of the influence wealth has on our economy. Businesses that prioritize profits over giving their employees a sustainable income act like a vacuum that sucks in low skilled immigrants: people who would not be competitive in our economy if we treated workers properly.\xa0\n\n\nStart arresting employers who don't pay living wages, and you'll see illegal immigration go down because there will not be any employers left for one of those immigrants get here.\n\n\nLikewise, our way of building communities and taxing property and prioritizing cars over public transportation and density makes it so it is hard for people to afford housing. Even if we get rid of every single illegal immigrant, that does not fix the problem of housing being too expensive.\xa0\n\n\nPeople breaking the law is bad, but illegal entry is definitely not the biggest problem our country is facing. The biggest problem is that we don't make things work for the working class."", 'Wow what a load of absolute garbage. You might need professional help.', ""Again, you just replaced every instance of migrant with illegal immigrant, and in a twist you replaced immigrant with non-immigrant? What does that even mean?  If they aren't immigrants we don't have to worry about them I guess because they aren't even here."", '>89 successful border policies within a year\n\nI mean we didn’t have a successful border policy.

Another fan powers post,"I've been trying to come up with my own powers for a while and it's kinda hard to think of something creative that isn't already a power, something that isn't too OP or too underpowered, something that isn't one-dimensional in that it can do more than one thing, and something that fits the macabre theme of some of the other powers.

&#x200B;

Here's some of what I've come up with,

&#x200B;

**Scatter**: Your body disperses into sand-like grains and moves forward swiftly, allowing you to pass through thin and small obstructions.

* Remote Control: A part of your body of your choosing scatters and reforms within a limited distance, allowing you to move it remotely. Ex: Remove your eye and reform it elsewhere to get a different perspective, remove your hand to interact with things with subtlety, etc.

**Nightmare**: Those affected by Nightmare witness their deepest fears, triggering fight-or-flight. Choose who sees the illusion and choose who/what you're placing the illusion on. Effects vary by type of individual.

**Evaporate**: Fire a projectile of light that renders a small radius of solid matter immaterial to use as a deadly weapon or to make small openings.

**New** **Purpose**: Enchant inanimate objects from a distance to perform actions they're capable of. Ex. stop a gun from firing, a door slams on an enemy when they approach

**Refracting Cloak**: A gel like substance envelops you, camouflaging you into your surroundings. It can be controlled to extend, stretching it further beyond you to cover something else at the cost of becoming visible.

* Crystalline Cloak: Choose to harden the cloak into crystal that can be used as a shield, a trap, or a weapon.

**Fascimilie**: Make a completely functional copy of a small object from a distance.

* Loyal Servant: Clone a subservient perfect copy of a human from a distance.

**Nullify**: Place a nullifying seal on a living target that deprives them of their senses. Placed on the eyes makes them blind, etc.

* Dismember: Seal a living target's limbs that renders that limb useless. Placing it on their leg cripples them, etc.
* Short Circuit: Place a seal on machines to temporarily disable them.

**Siphon**: Pierce a single target with vein-like tendrils, healing you or another by draining the victim of their blood. 

* Seeking Siphon: The tendrils spread to nearby victims.
* Blood Boils: Bubbles of hot blood in the tendrils form that explode when an enemy enters their proximity.

**Mind Scan**: Detect the presence of minds within an average sized radius and hear what they're thinking.

&#x200B;

(Passives)

**Spite**: Poisonous gas spews from your wounds. The closer your enemy the more debilitating and lethal the poison becomes.

**Pack Bond**: Form an arcane symbiotic relationship with an animal of your choosing. This animal is granted basic Agility, Reflexes, Strength, and Vitality and can be commanded.

&#x200B;

(Bone charms)

**Voltaic Cloak**: Your body is covered in electricity, harming those in melee range.

**Beastlike**: Your nails and teeth are now as sharp as claws and fangs.

**Sympathy Pain**: An enemy will feel the damage they inflict upon you.

**Obscure Presence**: Living things will have difficulty noticing you if you don't draw attention to yourself.

**Extrasensory**: Know when you're being watched and from where.

Major II Qualifier: Minnesota RØKKR vs Boston Breach,"# RØKKR Rebound?
After back to back heartbreaking game 5 losses to Ultra and OpTic respectively, Minnesota would come in near desperation mode against a new look Boston Breach squad. After a lackluster performance in Major I, Boston opted to replace SMG Capsidal with longtime CDL pro (and inaugural RØKKR player) Asim. RØKKR would hope to avoid falling victim to the **honeymoon stage** most new teams have. 

## Invasion Hardpoint
### First set of rotations
RØKKR would kick off invasion with a tooth and nail fight for both P1 and to defend their favorable P2 spawns. Minnesotan would be successful in their dual front battle to start the map, collecting 18 seconds to Boston’s 10 while also keeping spawns and rotating early towards P2. Boston kept P2 incredibly scrappy however, keeping Minnesota to just 23 seconds total even after having their desired set up. RØKKR would struggle to break out from their spawn as P3 popped up, giving Breach ample time to set up exactly how they wanted to. Breach wouldn’t waste the opportunity, as they would easily hold onto P3 for a full 60 seconds. As P4 popped Minnesota would be in position to take an early 15 seconds, however P4 tends to be so chaotic that neither time gets much time. This would run true for the most part, as Boston would only collect 15 seconds as well before RØKKR would break for the final 10 seconds. Lyynnz would find himself completely alone on the rotation to P5, thanks to Boston killing his teammates from afar. Breach would quickly hunt Lyynnz down to completely lock down P5, which they would successfully as Boston would hold P5 for just under 40 seconds total.

65-135

### Second set of rotations
Minnesota looked to rebound fast after a rough first set of rotations, and with P1 they’d have a decent start at it with a total of 28 seconds. Towards P2 both teams would have players near the hill as it popped, however Minnesota would come out on top of the trade department and would start to gain early time. This time would quickly be snuffed out however, as Slasher would call in a cruise missile to immediately break the Minnesota set up. The double kill with the cruise would only momentarily delay RØKKR however, as they would quickly regain control around the hill to start gaining time yet again. Minnesota would come out of P2 with a total of 37 seconds, propelling them right back into the game. Boston would find themselves rotated towards P3 early yet again, and much like last time they completely locked down the hill for their second full 60 hold of the game. RØKKR again found themselves at P4 early, locking down the first 20 seconds of the hill. Breach would find a break however, and quickly responded with 26 seconds of their own, while also keeping RØKKR pinned in their spawn. This forced RØKKR to cross the entirety of the map, just for a hope to contest P5 to stop Boston from closing it out. After finding a few kills Minnesota seemed in position to break the Boston set up, however Boston would keep it incredibly scrappy and forced Minnesota to fight for P5 until the very last second. 

166-243

### Third set of rotations
While RØKKR would have early control of P1, Boston would only need a single set of kills to finish the game off, which they would get after just 23 seconds. 

189-250

### Top Performer
*Accuracy* (team highs going 23/24 with 4808 damage) led the slaying numbers in a lopsided Invasion loss. No member of RØKKR went positive on the map, as they were out-slayed by 16 total kills.

## Invasion Search and Destroy 
### Round 1
RØKKR would start out on offense on another Invasion, and quickly they’d find themselves down a man as Accuracy would be first blooded off the break. Now in a 3v4, RØKKR would be forced to sit back near their spawn to try and find a kill. No kills were to be found however, as all 4 members of RØKKR would fall without winning a gunfight. 

0-1

### Round 2
Minnesota would spread their map for their first defensive round, with Lyynnz in an especially pushed up position as he would sneak past Boston. This would leave him completely out of the play initially however, as Boston quickly rushed towards the B bomb site with a numbers advantage. Accuracy would find first blood before quickly being traded out, and Lyynnz would get caught out on the flank to quickly make the round a 2v3 for Minnesota. Owakening would find a solo gunfight win against Slasher middle map, leveling the playing field at a 2v2. RØKKR was forced off the B site earlier in the round, giving Boston a free B bomb plant. Owakening falls to Priestahh, Vivid trades him out, however is unable to win the 1v1 against Snoopy as Boston secured another round.

0-2

### Round 3
RØKKR needed a bounce back round immediately lest the game start to slip away from them, and for their next offense they would opt for a slow push towards the A bomb site. After almost 45 seconds of minimal fighting Snoopy would find first blood onto Vivid, and Accuracy would immediately respond with a kill onto Slasher to make it a 3v3. Shortly after a spicy Lyynnz double kill would quickly give RØKKR a 3v1 advantage, and Accuracy would find the final kill of the round to put Minnesota on the scoreboard.

1-2

### Round 4
Minnesota would opt for a 3/1 split off the break, with 3 members going towards B and Owakening on an island at A. Boston decided on an A push off the break, quickly taking up map control near the site. Despite this control, Lyynnz would slip through the cracks to find first blood onto Asim middle map, giving RØKKR a 4v3 advantage early in the round. Breach would slow down momentarily, however with only 30 seconds left they’d be forced to try and make a play. Vivid would be lying in wait middle map to find a kill onto Snoopy, and the final 2 members of Breach would fall shortly after as RØKKR would take back to back rounds. 

2-2

### Round 5
RØKKR’s next offense would be one of their standard looks, spread the map near spawn and play for an opening kill before committing to either site. Lyynnz however would be let off the leash, as he would barrel towards the B bomb site and eventually find first blood onto Snoopy. With a 4v3 advantage, Minnesota would quickly commit to the B bomb site even as Vivid would fall. Owakening would get the bomb down quickly, as RØKKR would set up for a 3v3 head butt. Minnesota would keep Boston at a distance momentarily, before Priestahh would find a kill onto Owakening to give Breach a man advantage. This advantage would immediately be nullified however, as Accuracy would find a double kill on a lineup, forcing Slasher into a 1v2 situation. Slasher would only find a kill onto Accuracy, due to Lyynnz being there to trade him out immediately. 

3-2

### Round 6
RØKKR’s next defense was a bit more standard, as they would spread the map and hold angles in wait. Boston would slowly work the middle of the map, however they would work right into the sights of Lyynnz as he would find first blood onto Asim. Owakening immediately followed this up with a kill onto Snoopy, giving RØKKR a 4v2 advantage in the blink of an eye. Accuracy and Lyynnz would combine for the final 2 kills as RØKKR would secure another defensive round win.

4-2

### Round 7
RØKKR would play around Lyynnz cruise missile he earned last round by killing Asim, and off the back of a kill onto Priestahh RØKKR would quickly plant the bomb at A. Accuracy would fall on the opposite side of the map, forcing RØKKR into a 3v3. In a blistering set of gunfights, Vivid would pick up a double kill and Lyynnz the final to win the round for Minnesota. 

5-2

### Round 8
Minnesota opted for another 3/1 split for their next defensive round, however this time 3 players would rush towards A, with Accuracy on an island at B. The round would quickly break down for Boston, as Owakening would find a double kill to start the round to give RØKKR a quick 4v2 advantage. Lyynnz would be traded out, however Accuracy would find a kill across the map to put Priestahh in a 1v3 to save the map. Accuracy would deny any chance of a clutch, as Minnesota closed out Invasion with 6 straight round wins. 

6-2

### Top Performer
*Lyynnz* (9/3 with 1424 damage) and *Accuracy* (9/4 with a team high 1672 damage) made play after play in a dominating Invasion Search and Destroy game. 

## Invasion Control
### Round 1
RØKKR would spawn into Invasion Control on offense, and would choose to aggressively challenge the A zone off the break. Unfortunately for Minnesota, Boston was ready and waiting for the aggression, quickly wiping all 4 RØKKR players off the map. This would immediately put Minnesota into a spawn trap situation, where battling out of their base was impossible for the next 40 seconds. Vivid would find a small lane towards the A zone to momentarily stop the clock, however his teammates would still be stuck in spawn, so any chance of a play would rest on his shoulders. Vivid would get a a lot of attention and a single tick before falling, which would open up the B zone for RØKKR. Minnesota would use this opening to secure 2 ticks of progress on B, however Boston’s defense would eventually be too much as Breach would yet again wipe RØKKR off the map to secure the round. 

0-1

### Round 2
Minnesota would spread their defense out off the break, with Boston toying with the idea of heading towards the A zone, however not completely committing. RØKKR would shut that down quickly, forcing Boston to turn their attention towards the B zone. Breach would slowly gain 2 ticks of progress on B, before an Owakening triple kill forced them back to spawn.  With this Minnesota clamped down on defense, keeping Boston away from either zone. Owakening would finish the round on a 7 kill streak, with an impressive triple kill again in the final moments.

1-1

### Round 3
Minnesota played it safe off the break of their next offensive round, learning from their mistakes from round 1 and opting to push the B zone. RØKKR would quickly find both the kills and the ticks of progress on the B zone, capturing B completely to give themselves 2:13 to break Boston’s set up near the A zone. Breach would stabilize quickly, forcing RØKKR to push long routes to have any chance of getting near the zone. This killed a lot of time off the clock, as RØKKR would find themselves with over a minute of the clock gone with nothing to show for it. Owakening and Vivid would find 3 kills around the A zone with just over a minute left on the clock, completely opening up the A zone and map for Minnesota. This window of opportunity would stay open long however, as all 4 members of RØKKR would fall shortly after with only a single tick of progress to show for it. Minnesota would be tasked with fighting out of their spawn yet again, and for a moment it seemed they may have broken the Breach set up as they found 3 kills around the A zone. Snoopy and a respawning Asim would shut this down however, catching 3 RØKKR players off guard and closing the door on RØKKR’s hopes of stealing an offensive round. 

1-2

### Round 4
RØKKR would split their defense up 2/2 to either zone off the split, with Boston doing the same. Priestahh would find an early route onto the A zone, forcing Minnesota to turn and deal with him. For a moment he seemed unstoppable, picking up 4 kills and nearly solo capturing a single tick of progress on the zone. Lyynnz would finally be the one to take Priestahh down, and he would quickly make a play of his own by picking up a triple kill around the A zone. This would force all attention back towards the B zone, where RØKKR would be in position to start spawn trapping Boston. Minnesota would do just that, completely trapping Boston in their spawn and not allowing a single tick of progress. RØKKR locks up defense for the final round, as they led in ticks captured 7-2 through 4 rounds. 

2-2

### Round 5
With RØKKR securing defense for the final round, Boston chose to heavy push the A zone in hopes of catching RØKKR off guard. While Minnesota was ready for it, Boston was able to win the opening set of gunfights to push onto the A zone early in the round. Breach would manage to find a single tick of progress, before RØKKR finally stabilized the zone. This would force Boston to rotate towards the B zone, and they would quickly capture the zone in its entirety while also causing absolute chaos in the RØKKR spawn. With 2:04 left in the game, RØKKR had to fight not rotational gunfights, but also would need to worry about the looming flanker in their spawn named Asim. Asim would dip and dodge around numerous RØKKR players, before Minnesotan decided to simply ignore him in favor of killing his teammates off spawn. Eventually Lyynnz would find him with some long range shots, putting Boston right into the spawn trap **blender** that is Invasion. Boston had a chance with just under 10 seconds left in the round, however RØKKR would shut that down as they found all 4 kills necessary to win the map. 

3-2

### Top Performer
*Owakening* (lobby highs going 32/23 with 5876 damage) had himself another **monster** Control this stage, and this helped RØKKR push past the finish line against Boston in a gritty Invasion win. 

## Sub Base Hardpoint
### First set of rotations
RØKKR would start of with the less preferred spawns on Sub Base, and would be forced to fight early for both P1 control and P2 spawns. Boston would do a good job at juggling both to start the map off, keeping RØKKR off P1 almost completely whole mainting P2 spawns. Despite this, RØKKR would take only 15 seconds to break in to the hill, finally gaining some substantial time for themselves with a 41 second hold to finish off P2. Boston would opt to set up shop on and around P3, with RØKKR needing to traverse most of the map to even have a chance of contesting. It would take Minnesota 20 seconds just to get to P3, and when they finally arrived each member would fall and be sent back to spawn across the map. This would essentially force RØKKR to rotate early to P4, allowing them to properly set up to hopefully answer the full 60 from Breach at P3. While a strong hold initially, RØKKR would get broken for a bit of time and would only take 34 seconds from P4. Boston would find themselves on P5 early, finding just over 20 seconds before a Minnesota break would come through. RØKKR would take 37 seconds from P5, giving themselves a slight lead heading into the second set of rotations.

119-105

### Second set of rotations
RØKKR would find themselves trying to even get a kill on P1 to start, as Boston would take an impressive 36 seconds on P1 before a Minnesota break would come through. RØKKR would take the final 16 seconds of P1, as both teams switched focus towards P2. Breach and RØKKR had players around P2 as it popped up, and after the initial gunfights RØKKR would come out with a small amount of time. Off the respawn, Breach would win their gunfights to break the RØKKR setup, and would handily take the final 30 seconds of P2 as RØKKR would be unable to even get close to contesting again. With everyone rotating towards P3, the spawns started to get incredibly messy and RØKKR would find themselves on the short end of the stick (or far end of the map) because of it. Breach would essentially get a free break onto P3, which they use to rack up 43 crucial seconds. Yet again RØKKR was forced to rotate to P4, and yet again it wouldn’t take long for Boston to bully Minnesota out of the hill. This time instead of spawning out, RØKKR would be forced to fight out of the back spawn near P3, and Boston effectively trapped them there for about 15 seconds. RØKKR finally broke out of their spawn, and this time around actually got blessed with a Vivid spawn out towards P5. This gave RØKKR a bit of life, as no one from Boston was expecting it. This allowed Vivid to find an opening kill near P5, throwing Boston into disarray as RØKKR started gaining early time on the hill. Minnesota’s guns started to heat up a bit, as RØKKR would take 43 seconds from P5 to put themselves within striking distance of Boston. 

221-238

### Third set of rotations 
Minnesota needed to be perfect at P1 if they wanted to take the game and finish the series, however Boston would keep it incredibly messy on P1, as RØKKR would still take a majority of the time to put both sides only 8 seconds away from victory. Boston would be at P2 first, and this would allow them to slay RØKKR away from the point to secure the win and force a map 5. 

242-250

### Top Performer 
The SMG duo of *Lyynnz* (26/23 with 4400 damage) and *Vivid* (team highs going 27/27 with 4911 damage) led the way slaying wise in yet another close Sub Base loss. This isn’t the first time Sub Base hasn’t been kind to RØKKR, and for the third series in a row for Major II Minnesota go to a decisive game 5. 

## Karachi Search and Destroy
### Round 1
Minnesota would kick off Karachi on offense, and would split the map 3/1 towards the B bomb site, with Lyynnz being the lone player towards A. Boston matched this set up, and Asim would find first blood onto Vivid. Lyynnz would fall shortly after, as he would get caught trying to rotate towards B by Snoopy. This would leave Accuracy and Owakening in a 2v4, which they would not clutch as both players would fall without picking up a single kill.

0-1

### Round 2
RØKKR’s first defense would be an incredibly fast one, but not in the good way. Within the first 30 seconds of the round, while trying to set up, Owakening would be left in a 1v4. He would manage to find a single kill, before finally being hunted down.

0-2

### Round 3
Minnesota would opt for the same set up as their first set up, and Asim would be ready and waiting for Vivid for the first blood. RØKKR again would be fighting a man down, and would slow down the pace a bit in hopes of finding a kill to answer. No kills were to be found though, as the remaining 3 members of RØKKR would fall within 3 seconds of each other. 

0-3

### Round 4
RØKKR were in desperation mode, as through 3 rounds Owakening had Minnesotas only kill. Boston would slow their offense down, and Priestahh would find first blood onto Owakening to put RØKKR in yet another 3v4 disadvantage. Breach would choose to push towards A after the first blood, and Asim would find yet another kill to push RØKKR into a 2v4. Vivid would find a single kill, however both he and Lyynnz would fall side by side as Breach took a 4th round in a row. 

0-4

### Round 5
RØKKR would opt for a full push towards the A zone after 2 failed attempts towards B, and this go around they found a bit of success as Lyynnz and Owakening would combine for 2 kills off the break. Priestahh and Slasher would make it a bit interesting as they would find 2 kills on RØKKR players, however Owakening would close the round out with a double kill to finally put RØKKR on the board. 

1-4

### Round 6
RØKKR would split their defense up 3/1 towards the B site on their next defensive round, with Lyynnz per usual being the island player near A. Boston would 4 man push the B site, hoping to use Asim’s cruise missile to break open the site. An antenna must have gotten in the way, because the cruise seemingly exploded on nothing right before passing a building. Minnesota “survive” the cruise, and Vivid would find himself in position for first blood onto Asim, finally giving RØKKR a 4v3 advantage. Boston would manage to get the bomb down still, and all of a sudden 3 members of RØKKR would lose their gunfights, leaving Accuracy in a 1v3 situation. The odds were too much, as Accuracy would fall shortly after.

1-5

### Round 7
RØKKR would attempt to get aggressive middle map in a must win offense, however Asim would be lying in wait to find first blood onto Vivid. Priestahh would find a kill onto Owakening, and Accuracy would find a kill onto Asim to force RØKKR into a 2v3 situation. Accuracy would find another kill onto Slasher, however Lyynnz would fall simultaneously to Snoopy to put Accuracy in a 1v2 situation. Boston yet again shut the door for any type of clutch attempt, killing Accuracy and humiliating RØKKR on Karachi. 

1-6

### Top Performer
*Owakening* (team highs of 4/6 and 1504 damage) was essentially the only member of Minnesota shooting back at Breach in another demoralizing game 5 loss. 

# Key Factors/Statistics
- Lyynnz had a down series by his standards, going 15/22 on Invasion Hardpoint and 1-7 on Karachi Search and Destroy. Despite this, he still led RØKKR in KD with a 0.94 overall.

- Unlike last 2 series, RØKKR were outslayed the entire series. No member of RØKKR finished with an even or positive KD overall. 

- Owakening has been dominant in Control these last few series, and this one was no different as he dropped a 1.39 with 1k more damage than any other member of RØKKR. 

- RØKKR have now lost 3 game 5 Search and Destroys in a row, going 4-18 in round count during that stretch. Something is fundamentally wrong there.

# Next Match
Back to back to back 2-3 losses for RØKKR has set an unfortunate tempo to kick off Major II qualifiers, with the silver lining of playing each team incredibly close (up until the final map). RØKKR look to rebound next match, however it won’t be easy by any means as they next have a date with Atlanta FaZe, a perennial powerhouse in the CDL.",1b1gvpf,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/G2eSports/comments/1b1gvpf/major_ii_qualifier_minnesota_røkkr_vs_boston/,[]
This Community Does Not Give Enough Love to Certain Guns,"I've been playing for 3 years consistently, and have done a few events before then (I have the Jade Key and the Reaper). In all that time, I've been the only person I've ever seen using the following guns:

**AK12C-** This is such an underrated firearm, you're getting 36 limb at 60 studs to 21 limb at 100 or so, with a 30rnd magazine of 7.62x39mm. It can pick up from all assault rifles, gets around 1.5 studs of penetration, and generally makes the AK-12 and AKU12 look like garbage. It is criminal how little this is used, especially considering that it gets better close-range damage than the 7.62mm conversion on the AK12BR. I recommend the Comp Aimpoint, Compensator, Angled Grip, and Blue Laser for a cheap recoil control setup. You can also slap on the Squad Barrel for an AK-15.

**AK12BR (with 12.7x55mm)-** I shouldn't have to say anything about this gun, the fact that it can one-tap headshot and essentially acts like a Beowulf ECR or SVU-A with controllable recoil and an actually reasonable firerate of 500 RPM (finally, a powerful two-tap limb rifle that doesn't run out of ammo instantly!). It can pick up all battle rifle, DMR, and even select assault rifle ammo; waaayyyyy better than using an actual ECR. I recommend the Comp Aimpoint, Compensator, Angled Grip, and Blue Laser for a cheap recoil control setup.

**T36C (G36C with .300 Blackout)-** I love this gun specifically because of how unique it is compared to the original T36 or HK337. Unlike both of these weapons, the T36C gets the huge advantage of its torso kill range (35 limb out to 40 studs) and absurdly controllable recoil. I don't see this weapon ever, but I prebought the setup and have never looked back. I recommend the OKP-7, ARS Suppressor, Romanian Grip, and Blue Laser for a higher-end recoil control setup. Alternatively, the Coyote and Angled can be subbed out for a cheaper and only slightly less effective setup.

**AUG A1 Para (AUG A1 with 9x19mm Parabellum)-** It just works. Its velocity was buffed and it was way OP before then; now it has a 3SK, keeps the 5SK now and has 0 recoil. This weapon was way too good when it did 19 range, and now, it's literally a laser beam. Use the Delta Sight (and rely on the base scope), T-Brake, Pistol Grip, and Blue Laser.

**VPO-209 (.366 TKM)-** I don't know how to describe this thing except as a cool way to make an original SKS with a clip and wooden furniture. For LARPers or RPers, it's a cool and extremely good weapon. To make it, just equip Original Furniture and .366 TKM rounds. It's fun.",1b1go7b,6,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomForces/comments/1b1go7b/this_community_does_not_give_enough_love_to/,"['>underrated guns\n\n>AK12BR\n\n-_-', 'It is not that it not being loved or not, like your middle child, they just so happened to not exist in your eyes. \n\nThe META are your First child, they are badly treated emmotionally but they are well on its own.

What am I missing? Or am I just bad?,"In Single player, lasers were my weapon of choice. I grew up playing AC 1-4 and I always found myself preferring light weight sniper builds but 6s ricochet mechanic really cut the range down for me. While I get linear rifles were suppose to be the replacement. The laser rifles just felt better to me throughout 6 and I used the lightest one with a sampu and pulse blade to get through S ranking most the missions.

Now this was fine and I have no complaints. But when I got to PvP, at least for me lasers just don't perform. I ended up making another lightweight (inspired by BVO but tuned to my preferences) with dual stun guns, missiles, and a hammer, and that carried me to A with no problems what so ever. However when I hit A it became a different story all together.

At this point I've given up my dreams of making S before the reset but I've still been tweaking build ideas in the hopes of doing it next season. Therefore I'm again looking at lasers and linear rifles. On the receiving end lasers are a nightmare for me. Granted its really only the LCB and shotguns that im seeing, but it really feels like they abuse the net code heavily and get free damage constantly. And everyone is always charge firing their lasers. 

Same thing with linear rifles. I don't see them too often but they do show up with enough regularity that I know the pain of a linear rifle charge attack stagger combo.  But again. It seems like everyone just only charge fires them.

So my original assumption was thats the problem. I'm never charge firing, thats why they don't work for me. But after a depressing amount of point loss and burying myself in A0. I just for the life of me can't land hits like my opponents can with a charged attack. And non charge attacks just don't seem to have the accuracy and stagger values to give me better results than just using my main build. Even after adjusting for better target tracking and recoil control. 

So at this point I'm forced to ask. Are there any tips or tricks to getting good with lasers and/or linear rifles? What advice would you give someone trying to move on from a BVO styled build to something more mid to long range that isn't a missile rat?",1b1gnz5,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/armoredcore/comments/1b1gnz5/what_am_i_missing_or_am_i_just_bad/,"['Please don’t use lasers. They are EXTREMELY affected by lag. They are the cancer of ranked. I’m not saying you’re cancerous, but as a community, I think we should distance ourselves from laser.', ""Hand-carried lasers don't really stagger that much, but they do excellent damage. A build going heavy on lasers is going to be focused on raw DPS rather than stagger and punish (though back-mounted lasers can build up decent stagger if they hit). Make sure you have a generator with solid energy firearm spec and try to keep outside your opponent's optimal range - lasers outrange most kinetic weapons.""]"

# Strike

*5 Plays (3 and 4 players)*

Few moments in this hobby are as thrilling as finding a perfect filler game that sucks your entire table into its wacky antics. Strike was the latest such title to… strike that sweet spot. Across two different game night sessions, it reeled the group in within moments and had us clamoring for more after a lightning quick round of uproars.

Strike is all about tossing a die into a gauntlet with passion, precision, belief, and desperation. This gauntlet is the game box itself with a deep coliseum-like insert and a mat at the bottom for the dice to reside. 

When it’s your turn to step up to the plate, you’ll pick up a single die from your pool and carefully hurl it into the ring, often trying to knock the other dice around and form sets of dice of the same number. Any pairs or triplets or quadruplets or so on that you happen to create with your dice striking become instant rewards that you may claim from the box and stash back in your pool. Congratulations, your turn is over.

If you happen to not cause any matching dice to smile up at you, then you can simply cut your losses and call it a turn. Or you can toss another die into the ring… and another, and another, and another until you finally form some sets or run out of dice. Hopefully you don’t run out of dice, that’s how you get eliminated!

But things are brilliantly nuanced in this simple game… each die displays an X instead of a 1. A rolled X means the die is removed from the game entirely, thereby shrinking the stock of dice over time. You can similarly burn a die if it happens to bounce out of the pit entirely (and you can bask in shame while your opponents laugh at you). Furthermore, any player that completely clears out the gauntlet (rolls all matches) forces the next player to throw in *all* of their dice. It’s like taking a shotgun blast to the chest at point blank, because that player only gets any matching dice back.

These two little ingredients — the X’s and the “All In” roll — are what take Strike from an amusing little thing to a riotous occasion. You’ll cackle as you watch your pitiful neighbor burn all of their dice in one turn through a stream of rolled X’s. You’ll chant as a friend casts their last desperate die into the pit. You’ll shout with glee as the villain of the table is forced to go all-in with their envious supply of dice, and you might even roar with shock if they cast a miracle into the box and GET ALL SIX OF THEIR DICE BACK BECAUSE THEY ROLLED ALL FIVES (this happened in our last game and it was mind blowing).

Strike is a good reminder of why dice are one of the most iconic, timeless, and versatile components in all of gaming. Even the most knuckleheaded of games can harness them in dramatic, captivating, and memorable ways.

**Prognosis: Excellent**

The designers behind scrumptious 2-player games including 7 Wonders Duel and Splendor Duel (Bruno Cathala) as well as Jaipur (Sébastien Pauchon) have teamed up to make a new 2-player game? That’s enough to put Sobek: 2 Players on my radar.

Even if the credits were kept secret, it wouldn’t be too difficult to see where this game takes its inspiration. The tempo of the game (collecting goods, forming sets, taking one action to avoid taking another) feels very similar to Jaipur. The market board also feels a bit like Splendor Duel in how players claim tiles from it and then eventually refill it when needed.

Sobek primarily stands out in how it lets you claim tiles from the market board. A large chunky Ankh pawn roams around the board to whichever space the next tile gets taken from. Its arms extend outward in opposite directions, and these arms dictate which tiles are available to you. It will point along a single row, column, or diagonal that presents your tile options. These arms are pointed in whatever direction the last tile taken from the board indicated. 

This interesting directional restriction is frosted with a perfect final rule: you can take any tile in the line, but if you jump over any tiles then those get added to your corruption board. Adding tiles to your corruption board is as bad as it sounds —you’ll likely give your opponent a lot of end game points if you have more corruption tiles than them.

This core gameplay loop is far and away the most compelling aspect of Sobek: 2 Players. You’ll want to keep tabs on which tile types your opponent is picking up and then try to play keep away with the tile options that you give them. If you’re lining them up with a juicy tile, then you at least want to put one or more corruption tiles between the ankh and their prize to make them think twice. Whenever you both foresee the inevitable — when the next player to take a tile will set up their opponent for an even better tile — that’s when you’ll pull out all the stops to avoid taking the next tile. You have to take an action, and if it’s not taking a tile, then it’s playing a character or selling a set. Back and forth you go until somebody runs out of alternate actions or relents.

There are strong incentives to play a character or sell a set earlier, though. Each time you sell a set, you get to peruse the powerful face-down pirogue tokens to take and use one ability right away. The character tiles (which are also claimed from the market board and added to your hand) present even more situationally useful abilities. Diverse and varied as they are, these abilities present a surplus of exciting strategies and tactics you can explore from one play to the next. But for better or worse, they have a habit of blindsiding you.

Two of the character tiles that can end up your hand allow you to obliterate your opponent’s hand in the right moment (make them discard all of their earned tiles down to six total). As soon as this tile effectively decapitates one player’s chances of victory, neither of you will feel inclined to hold too many tiles in future plays. Depending on how painful this lesson is, the targeted player may never wish to play again.

Another character tile lets the player draw three juicy tiles from the top of the deck. Unless it’s near the end of the game (where unused tiles end up in your corruption stack), this is absolutely one of the more powerful abilities. Others can feel much less useful in most situations. At the very least, they can alternatively be used as a good tile in a set. But the fact that they all stay facedown until you claim them from the board makes characters feel more swingy and unpredictable.

If character tiles were the only swingy aspect of the game, then it would certainly be an easier competition to digest. But that is merely one point in the three-pronged swing fest that is Sobek: 2 Players. The other two elements of luck come from the facedown pirogue tokens and random bag of deben (point) tokens. For some reason, the pirogue tokens stay face down the entire game, yet when a player earns one (for selling goods) they can look at all of the tokens. There are only two players in the game and five tokens available to claim, but for some reason you need to keep this information secret the entire game.

The worst offender is undoubtedly the deben tokens which can grant anywhere from 3 to 9 points. Where final scores usually end up between 50 and 70 points, a couple lucky deben draws can easily swing the victory in a player’s favor.

2-player games are customarily a tight battle of wits, and Sobek is no exception with its cat-and-mouse gameplay via the roaming Ankh pawn. Yet one might feel a bit of disconnect from the gameplay when it regularly cozies up to wild and swingy moments. The satisfying taste of a clever maneuver or well-executed strategy can be undercut by the massive dollop of luck — like too much ketchup on a burger or sour cream in a taco.

The unique core is almost enough to forgive Sobek for overstepping its bounds. The only problem is that I can easily enjoy a more satisfying 2-player meal simply by playing Splendor: Duel, Jaipur, and the like.

# Ingenious (2023 Edition)

*2 Plays (2 and 4 Players)*

*Review Copy Provided by the Publisher*

Ingenious is a classic abstract family game by Reiner Knizia that I’ve talked about in the past. It is one that has been in my collection for a few years now thanks to the satisfying simplicity it has provided. I’ve also compared it to Axio (it’s square-based sibling) which seems to be the favorite of the two among Kniziaphiles. Nevertheless, my attention was caught when publisher Kosmos announced a new version of Ingenious that includes new rules. 

Those new rules come primarily in the form of an added 2-player dueling variant which I had the chance to try. But I also took advantage of the renewal by testing out the 4-player partnership mode. I’m happy to report that both were good.

The duel mode is an interesting one in how it changes the victory objective. You are no longer competing to have the highest score of your weakest color. Instead, you are playing a tug of war with all of the colors. The player who has more score pegs on their side at the end of the game (or all pegs on their side at any time) wins.

Rather than the usual two-player experience of targeting your opponent’s weakest color (walling it in, preventing them from scoring more), you are wrestling for the favor of all of the colors.  It gets a bit tricky if you score a line of a color only for your rival to follow with a matching tile and score an even longer line of that color. The need for tactical blocking while scoring becomes quite apparent. I’m not sure it’s a better 2-player experience than the original Ingenious rules, but it’s certainly a fun way to mix up the formula.

The 4-player partnership mode is a great way to preserve the strengths of the 2-player game while allowing twice as many players to enjoy the fun. The suggested rules are that no communication is allowed. At least not any indication of what is in your hand. But we still found plenty of ways to taunt and banter. The main downside here is that a novice player can make critical mistakes which will leave their teammate withering inside.

For those who already own and enjoy Ingenious, there is no need to convert to this edition. The partnership mode is in the old edition, and the new dueling rules and board are interesting to explore but non-essential. For those who don’t own the game and are interested, there is certainly no better time to jump in. This new box is actually a bit smaller and better in quality too. Of course, if Axio is just as easy to acquire, then you have a much more difficult decision ahead of you. 

Ingenious isn’t my favorite tile placement game in my collection… far from it. Yet it carries a regal timelessness to it that I’m happy to keep and break out on occasion. I know I’m always going to have a good time with it, and now I can mix things up even further across the several modes.

**Prognosis: Good**

# World Wonders

https://preview.redd.it/mobo2q52q5lc1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d65684bb8a67f6c66538bce503c2f49e715410a

*1 Play (2 Players)*

I’m not sure exactly how many polyomino games I’ve played now, but it’s gotta be somewhere around 15. 15 games that feature polyomino puzzling — most designs have it as the central focus, but a couple feature it as a supplemental mechanism. I currently own about half that many, and I’ll be the first to admit that nobody needs that many polyomino games in their life.

World Wonders is tossing its hat into very a crowded ring, but this genre is still very hot as the sales of 2022’s Planet Unknown and Foundations of Rome would indicate. Yet these games would also indicate that you need to be desperately unique with stuff like lazy susans or overproduced monstrosities in order to stand out these days. Fortunately, in the case of World Wonders, it brings piles of pretty wood to the table. In fact, it probably stands second only to Foundations of Rome in the contest for prettiest polyomino game. The colorful artwork is punctuated by the chunky wooden wonders (there are over 20 of them).

Unfortunately, the presentation of World Wonders is where its genre superiority begins and ends. That is unless you prefer a game that is three times as slow, three times as convoluted, and three times as bitty as its main counterparts. 

You see, I find that I prefer polyomino games that are tight in their scoring, tense in their puzzling, and fast in their playing. The gold standards for me are My City and Patchwork. My City forces you to plan out the placement of your dwindling supply of tiles and then writhe in agony as they enter your board in the wrong order. Patchwork demands laser precision in covering your empty spaces while managing your time and button economy. These games bring out the best of spatial puzzling by requiring discipline from their players while forcing them to adapt on the fly. Importantly, they also do not overstay their welcome.

World Wonders is a very different beast. While it presents itself as yet another polyomino puzzler, it welds a whole bunch of extra mechanisms and considerations onto this experience. Where My City tells you what piece you must use, and Patchwork gives you three options, World Wonders often gives you ten or eleven or twelve options (or up to fourteen in a 5-player game). And you’re not just deciding which of these many shapes to take and fit onto your board. You’re also deciding which tracks you want to advance up, which public objectives you are gunning for, which wonder requirements you are positioning for, what you want to spend your remaining money on this round, and more. There’s enough to chew on that our 2-player game went far beyond one hour… I cannot fathom how long a 5-player game takes. 

Yet all these mechanical considerations (and the table presence of the components) add up to a perfectly sensible explanation for why World Wonders is the hottest polyomino game of 2023. We find ourselves in an industry culture where more is more, and less doesn’t often impress. Why have one mechanism when we can have five? Why have two ways to score when we can have six? Why have forty game pieces when we can have two-hundred? An increase in quantity of things doesn’t always lead to a decrease in quality of experience, but it far too often waters down the satisfaction for me.

We enjoyed our play of World Wonders. The wonders themselves are a treat to claim and position on your board. There’s no shortage of decisions to puzzle through. We just didn’t find any reason to bring this one back to the table when the proven titans of this genre cut straight to the good stuff in a fraction of the time and effort.

# Chomp

https://preview.redd.it/ehmrtf24q5lc1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e46b364b5b1db00b3aa8a18618f0a98dcb93517

*2 Plays (2 Players)*

In a lot of ways, Chomp feels like Sprawlopolis: Dinosaur Edition. You’ve got the spatial arranging and overlapping of cards that are divided into four quadrants on the front and unique scoring goals and conditions on the back. The key difference here is that Chomp is a competitive game, not a cooperative game. That, and the fact that many of these sections or quadrants contain desperately hungry dinosaurs.

Herbivores want to be next to plants so they can live on in peace. Carnivores want so prehistoric rats to munch on, but if they can’t have that then they’ll settle for the nearest herbivores. For these hungry Dinos, skipping a meal leads to instant extinction (just like my cheerful mood).

So as you puzzle these square cards together, you’ll try to keep all of your creatures happy. The ones that survive do score points after all. Luckily, there are ways to earn extinction points as well… 

On your turn you’ll simply take one card that is either face-up (to add to your growing map) or face-down (for another personal scoring objective). You’ll want to cover up the poisonous sludge spaces as you juggle the needs of hungry mouths and demanding goals. If you’re like my wife, then you may find this theme to be an exhausting extension of real life — being a stay-at-home mother of two endlessly snacky toddlers.

This dinosaur wants milk, but it only wants it in a green cup, not the red cup. That dinosaur wants its Stegosaurus nuggets cut up into smaller pieces. This dinosaur has been pestering you for minutes about giving it a snack, but now that you’ve put food in front of it is too distracted by the newly discovered mud pit to eat. Despite preferring simpler games and spatial puzzles, you can probably guess that my wife didn’t love Chomp, haha.

For a little filler game, there are a surprising amount of conditions to keep track of: The hierarchy of dietary needs and resolutions, everything that can kill or feed a herd, when quadrants are adjacent versus when they aren’t (if mountain ranges are blocking the way), what must be accomplished to score goal points, etc. It takes some time to settle all the end-game chomping, exterminating, and scoring.

Nothing here is groundbreaking or flashy. And it certainly lacks the fangs of more interactive fillers. Fortunately, it’s just quick and thinky enough that I don’t mind chomping around for a few minutes. Of course, I’m not the one who has to spend every day feeding hungry mouths. I mostly just fix them.

**Prognosis: Fair**

*2 Players (3 & 4 Players)*

I’m not well versed in the world of fashion. I like to wear the comfiest clothes in my closet and stopped caring about mixing up my look or style years ago. I have a rack of dozens of ties that I’ve accumulated over the years, but these days you’ll only see me wear one of two possible ties to church on Sunday. I prefer to devote my decision energy to more pressing matters, like which board game I should play on a given game night.

Furthermore, my education on the topic of fashion and modeling begins and ends at the movie Zoolander. But that doesn’t keep me from appreciating the style and presentation of Couture. A game as visually attractive as this can easily break through such barriers. All the easier when the game is a quick filler with a refreshing twist on auctions. 

Over the course of seven speedy auction rounds, players must decide where to commit their bidding cards. Rather than permanently spending your bidding power away, you keep it (and even upgrade it) over the game and simply decide how to divide it up from one round to the next. Everybody starts with a hand of four bidding cards and two divider cards. You will divide your bidding cards into three sections or locations: New York, Paris, and Tokyo. This is done in an effort to have first, second, or third dibs on the three cards up for grabs at each site.

The cards you can win are either upgraded bidding cards or various point scoring cards. A majority competition here, a variety set there, a set of pairs here, some negative point flop cards there. Your usual set collection kind of stuff. What’s interesting is that if less than three people bid at a site, then one player could end up with more than one of the rewards there (for better or worse).

So you’ll find yourself making plenty of tough decisions across these seven rounds. Where do I think my opponents are going to bid hardest? Should I spend all of my power trying to outbid them, or should I aim for the easier sites? Now that I’ve gotten first or second place in an auction, which card do I claim? Should I opt for more points or more bidding power? 

For a tiny filler game, there is plenty of crunch here. Where many small-box Allplay titles aim to be more breezy and casual, Couture is definitely on the weightier end of the spectrum. The unique setting is also a welcome departure from the usual gaming fare. Those looking for an intelligent and pretty auction game will be pleasantly surprised.

# Marabunta

https://preview.redd.it/1yqfdtm8q5lc1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7332c056638646622ca97baa30eec6ac674b198

*3 Plays (2 Players)*

Normally it seems to take a while for the new year to start giving us killer new board game releases. But in the case of 2024, we are starting off strong straight out of the gates thanks to Marabunta — the most deliciously brutal roll & write I have ever played.

Those who normally lose interest the moment they hear roll & write should stick around a bit longer. This one is genuinely unique within the genre. Yes, there is still rolling, and there is still writing. But in reality, Marabunta feels much more like a Knizia tile placement strategy game… for two players… featuring I split, you choose.

At the center of the table is one of The Good Doctor’s most favorite shapes of all time — the hexagon. Loads of hexagons. These hex spaces make up a grid that is divided into 6 color regions. You and your opponent are competing over these color regions. Whichever player has the highest sum of numbers written across the spaces of that region at the end of the game will score their leaf points for that color.

There are six dice, each one with a unique color matching the six regions. Aside from their unique colors, all of the dice are exactly the same. Their faces display in their color a 1, 2, 3, and leaf banner, plus a wild (colorless) 0 and a crate. If you end up using a blue die that displays a 2, then that means you can write a 2 onto a blue region space. The players each have a dry erase marker of their color, so you know which numbers belong to which player.

So far things sound pretty straightforward. But these next wrinkles are what make Marabunta so agonizing. Each round you’ll alternate which player rolls all the dice and splits them up into two groups. Then the opposing player takes one of the two options and uses everything in that pool, and the player who split the dice then follows suit by using the pool that wasn’t selected by their opponent.

The reason that splitting up the dice or choosing an option is often painful is because players are severely restricted with how they spread their ant-ish presence on the board. You can only write a new number next to one of your existing numbers, and you can only break this adjacency rule twice during the game (once at the start, and again when you decide to spend your remaining anthill). 

These tight restrictions open the door for players to be nasty to each other by cutting one another off from areas entirely. It’s reminiscent of Through the Desert — just switch out the camels for ants. The moment you box your opponent out of a color region is the moment you make 1 of the 6 dice effectively 50% useless to them. If they end up with a 1, 2, or 3 of that color, they can’t even use it.

During my first play of the game, my opponent savagely barred me from entry into 2 different color regions. The next several rounds were a procession of the most brutal gaming moments that I can recall in recent memory. Every time the dice showed those searing colors, I felt another punch to the gut. My rival gleefully split them into options that always felt bad for me and good for him. I couldn’t suppress my steady drum of groans. Marabunta was ruthless, merciless, sadistic… and I loved it.

Unlike literally every other roll & write, flip & write, whatever & write game that I’ve ever played, Marabunta has players writing and racing and wrestling and blocking on the same shared map. Unlike most everything else in this genre, players don’t simultaneously apply all of the results the dice give them, like lonely plants absorbing the sun’s rays; rather, one player slices the dice cake as outwardly equal yet secretly selfish as they can and then hopes their rival leaves them with the best piece.

There are individual player boards that let you spend resources, work toward bonuses, and race up point tracks. But these genre tropes are merely the cogs that support this system of mind games and competitive gambits. Notably, the bonuses (earned by collecting crates) and wild zeros (that can be written into any color region) provide just enough wiggle room to pivot tactics and surprise your opponent. Some bonuses grant you extra numbers to write out on the board (like wild dice results). Others bestow upon you a bonus anthill — a much needed boon when your opponent has blocked your access into a vital region.

You’re not just struggling for majority and exclusivity on the map regions, but you are also racing to claim the bonus cupcakes and crates displayed on certain hexes. Each cupcake you earn lets you cross out the next treat on your cupcake track. At first, these spaces grant you nothing. But after claiming enough cupcakes, you’ll be earning 1 then 2 then 3 points at a time.

This is when the tension of the splitting decision is at his highest… when the region control point swings are massive *and* the dessert stakes are high. If the rewards are split poorly, then one player will come away with a gleeful prize and the other will come away with stinging regret. It’s enough pressure to make your ears steam, and it’s the exact opposite kind of experience that we’ve been trained to expect from a roll & write. Speaking of steam, experienced players are likely to steamroll their opponent due to how much foresight and valuation is required. Marabunta is obviously best for two equally matched players.

As he’s done with other hot genres (most notably legacy games and deck builders), Reiner Knizia took a step back from the trends and observed them from a distance. He asked himself, “What is missing from this genre?” and then proceeded to answer the question with an absolute banger of a refreshing design. It’s one of the many reasons why I like working with him so much and why he remains my favorite designer.

**Prognosis: Excellent**

First thoughts about Mass Effect Andromeda ,"Played an hour of Andromeda last night (for the first time) and here are my personal first thoughts:

-Surprising Lack of Charactcer Editing: I’m a big fan of character editing so I was hopeful to have some more editing options then I did in the trilogy considering Andromeda is the “newer” game but… I was wrong. There were no options to change the nose shape, eye shape, mouth shape, and the sliders were like the generic “height”, “depth”, and “width”. At least in the Trilogy I could select from several different styles for these things! The hair looked better but the male hairstyles were just… boring. I don’t even want to talk about the scars… should have called them “fresh wounds” cause they are still red and sore looking! As for the tattoos and makeup I have no idea if it was a glitch but half of them were extremely pixelated.

-The character dialogue: The dialogue in this game is like “I’m going to say something #Relatable and hope it’s funny” but it just kinda made me cringe. Just looked it up and the main character is 22 years old but when I was that age I wasn’t saying witty things like this. Maybe it’s just me on this one tbh or maybe I’m just use to Shepard and them being more around my age (31). 

-The combat: The controls for the combat seem a little weird for me. Sometimes I struggle to get into cover and end up taking serious damage. The powers I have used are good so far, happy they track the enemies. The guns feel weak to me or maybe the first aliens we fight are just extremely armored?

-The map: I don’t have a lot to say yet other then I have no idea where I’m going but I also had this problem in ME1 so I’ll push through somehow.

These are the observations I remember from last night anyway. Has anyone had similar experiences? Will things get better somehow? I’ll still play the whole game cause I like giving games the chance but it’s… interesting right now.",1b1fh9g,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/1b1fh9g/first_thoughts_about_mass_effect_andromeda/,"['Keep playing and you’ll get used to the combat. In fact, I find combat in Andromeda the most fun of all the series and I have to adjust to the earlier games when I play them. \n\nIt takes a little while, but once you start having multiple profiles you can switch out during gameplay, you become very flexible and can handle different situations. Examples: If I’m fighting Remnant, I might load a profile with some abilities to take down shields quickly. If I’m facing organics, I might start going biotics heavy with an adept profile. And if I just want some fun, I’ll charge forward swinging the Asari sword because why not?\n\nCover is not as useful as in ME2, so think of it more like in ME3 where you can’t turtle. Use the mobility of the jump pack often. Combos are key, know what primes and what detonates. Also, craft weapons when you can.\n\nAs for the rest: well, it comes down to taste and you seem to be giving it an honest shot. It may click with you and it may not. But I will say that all the main characters show some growth, but if you’re expecting battle hardened protagonists you won’t find it here. I find it refreshing that the cast is more a band of misfits than in the trilogy. It gives it a more adventurous tone compared to the seriousness at times in the other games.\n\nI prefer the trilogy and its characters, but Andromeda is in my mind a solid entry into one of my favorite gaming settings. It’s not perfect, it’s rough around the edges and isn’t for everyone, but it has heart.\n\nEdited\n\nOh, one last thing. Don’t feel obligated to try to complete all missions. Focus on main story beats, companion quests (these are spread throughout the game for each character), and do minor quests as you see fit or find compelling. No need to spend time gathering random minerals unless you feel a need to gain some rewards. I highly recommend you do the Ryder Family Secrets quest. It’s admittedly a bit of a fetch quest but it has some interesting implications for the characters.', ""ok, you've only got 70 more hours to go (even if you skip 99% of the optional content).""]"

# Anti
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-A
* **Name:** ██████ █████
* **Birthdate:** December 12
* **Nationality:** Canada (🇨🇦)
* **Species:** Parahuman (Benign)
* **Power:** Unstable Shadow
* **Likes:** Books, bikes, chocolate
* **Dislikes:** Bullies, bright lights

*“Anti is a newcomer from an unassuming background, living with ordinary parents in a quiet Canadian town before being enrolled in our academy. Anti’s superpower appears to be the ability to warp the physical properties of their surroundings, conjuring brief, yet highly volatile changes in behavior of matter compared to a spatial anomaly, loosely described as ‘black holes’. This power manifest following Anti being caught up in the collateral of a battle between the superheroine Syzygy and supervillain ████████ -- in the fallout and subsequent discovery, they were enrolled in the Institute at the behest of their parents, who believed ours to be the most qualified to manage their new paranatural developments.*

*Anti’s anomalous properties have the potential to cause damage to fellow personnel, surrounding facilities, and themselves. As there is little to no precedent for developing supers with powers of this ability at an adolescent level, special attention has been requested as per orders by Headmaster No.1 Angel. Administration notes Anti to be a rather reserved student, favoring typical academic subjects, having a vested hesitation towards any training involving physical violence, and appears to have trouble interacting with other students, with bullying being a noted issue. The stability and progress of their development is to remain the subject of concern.”*

# Hellbound

* **Class/Student Number:** 404-B
* **Name:** ██████ █████
* **Birthdate:** May 18
* **Nationality:** █████ (██)
* **Species:** Parahuman (Dormant)
* **Power:** Draconic Possession
* **Likes:** Exercise, cooking, karaoke
* **Dislikes:** Sleep, writing

*“The background of Hellbound is one of questionable sacrifice -- the princess to a waning monarchy in eastern Europe, she became the subject of a demonic pact as an attempt by her family to gain leverage in returning to their long-lost position of power. The ritual was successful, but their ability to tame the fiery, draconic berserker they created was not. Her enrollment in our academy was with an expectation that she can be properly tamed in preparation for her expected unleashing on her (to remain withheld) state.*

*Due to the nature of her possession posing a safety risk to our students, faculty, and infrastructure, Hellbound requires rigorous monitoring. She must be remain in her magic shackles unless noted, as not only do they keep her physically restrained, they are designed to temper her mind and keep her at ease, away from violent desires. She’s actually quite a darling while lucid, but DO NOT assume she is harmless at any point -- she has sharp teeth and will use them.”*

# The Vigilante Smog Monster

* **Class/Student Number:** 404-C
* **Name:** ███████
* **Birthdate:** February 13
* **Nationality:** Australia (🇦🇺)
* **Species:** “Swamp Monster”?
* **Power:** Living Smog
* **Likes:** Ancient history, nature walks, mangoes
* **Dislikes:** Fire, electronics

*“The Vigilante Smog Monster, nicknamed affectionately by other students as ‘Smoggy’, is quite the odd superbeing. According to him, he was summoned by an Aboriginal tribe who believed him to be a guardian spirit, a duty that he was not familiar with and was not particularly able to serve. At some point in time, he became separated from his tribe following an incident involving ‘invaders’, but eventually found his way to the company of some of our recruitment scouts, which led to him enrolling himself in our school.*

*Smoggy is odd, yet hardly enigmatic. Aside from his uncertain origin, he is what he is: a slimy, monstrous humanoid of sludge, smoke, and fire, equipped with enchanted wooden masks carved by the tribe who found him. He is among our more physically imposing students, but mentally appears quite morally fluid -- calm, affable, and inert, yet seemingly unafraid of using his form for much more ruthless purposes when the time comes. May require physical accommodations for his large, unhygienic form. He has been permitted to not require full uniform for obvious reasons; necktie is sufficient. He has also been exempt from chemistry courses.”*

# Twintails (Red/Rin)
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-DA/404-DB
* **Name:** █████ Red ██ (Red) / █████ “Rin” █████ (Rin)
* **Birthdate:** September 17 (Red) / July 7 (Rin)
* **Nationality:** Japan (🇯🇵)
* **Species:** Human (allegedly)
* **Power:** Fire Wizard (Red) / Fox Ninja (Rin)
* **Likes:** Gaming, TV (Red), dance, cosplay (Rin)
* **Dislikes:** Outdoors (Red), indoors (Rin)

*“A young master in the arcane arts of a wizarding clan. A prodigy in assassination from a ninja order. Both coming from remote villages and destined for greatness, before fate brought them together in the most literal way possible. Their paths crossed when supposedly, they came across a trickster kitsune spirit that fused them into one body, where one maintains control and form at a time, alternating on a regular basis, whenever the current host sneezes. The complications arising from this have necessitated the completion of their training on an agreed neutral ground, that being our academy, until a means to separate them is found.*

*Both ‘Twintail Red’ and ‘Twintail Rin’ are aware of their alternate identity and accuse one another of being the trickster spirit they respectively encountered, cohabiting their body under a fictional human alias, referring to their counterpart with contempt. We are to accommodate for both students and develop a means to cultivate their respective practices while also easing them into their highly unusual crisis of identity. These two share immense potential, neither of which are to be ignored.""*

# IDKYS
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-E
* **Name:** ██████ ██████ ████████
* **Birthdate:** March 12
* **Nationality:** Philippines (🇵🇭)
* **Species:** Parahuman (Benign)
* **Power:** Siren Song
* **Likes:** Telenovelas, swimming, curry
* **Dislikes:** Competition, feedback

*“Introducing: IDKYS (officially condensed from ‘I Don’t Know You, Sorry’). The daughter of Filipino music royalty, she also carried down the voice of a Siren, possessing intense hypnotic abilities, with her path to success and superstardom effectively being a given. However, in a surprising demonstration of restraint, her family has not treated the keys to their empire as simple birthright, and enrolled her in the Institute in order to develop her career skillset without coasting on her connections or powers.*

*As per request of her family, IDKYS is to be equipped with a custom-built face mask that mutes her natural voice and converts it to TTS as a means of restraining her hypnotic properties while maintaining her ability to communicate. Interestingly enough, early notes from faculty members have found that she displays immense amounts of confident charisma regardless, and has amassed quite the following among the student body. Teachers have expressed concern for this, with disciplinary action having already taken place for assistance in attaching her mask to an energy-based SFX converter, as well as employing classmates to finish her homework.”*

# Magnus VI
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-F
* **Name:** ████ “Magnus” █████ VI
* **Birthdate:** June 4
* **Nationality:** USA (🇺🇸)
* **Species:** Cyborg
* **Power:** Reconstructive Self-Destruction
* **Likes:** Pro wrestling, cars, jazz music
* **Dislikes:** Horses, sugar

*“Magnus VI is the latest in a line of experimental cyborgs set by the ████████ █████, a tech company most known for providing the most cutting-age armaments for enterprising supers (for better and for worse). In the quest to design the ‘perfect’ cyborg, Magnus VI was made to demonstrate effective indestructibility, being designed not just of the most durable lightweight armor and circuitry available, but featuring the ability to automatically reassemble and reconstruct himself upon destruction. Tied to this is his combat capability, with Magnus being able to manually detonate any joint on his body. Indestructible and lethal.*

*Magnus has been enrolled in our Institute due to this combination leading him to be quite the problem domestically, with the expectation by his guardians to ‘teach him how to not be ████.’ He is not a particularly violent student, but he has gotten into trouble regarding his arrogant and confrontational attitude, eating another student's lunch, and breaking a dorm window while practicing ‘trickshots’.”*

# Metal Alice
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-G
* **Name:** “Little” Alice ███████
* **Birthdate:** January 27
* **Nationality:** France (🇫🇷)
* **Species:** Possessed Automaton
* **Power:** Phantasmic Metal Generation
* **Likes:** Classical music, sweets, horses
* **Dislikes:** Guns, disclosure

*“Once upon a time, there was Little Alice, an ordinary, happy young girl raised by her loving father, who -- unbeknownst to her -- was the supervillain █████████. She was unaware of her father’s wrongdoings during her lifetime up until she was caught in the crossfire of one of his schemes, perishing in the process. Unable to accept this tragedy, Alice’s father devoted all his efforts to attempt resurrecting her, and after much tribulation, he had located her soul and brought it back into our realm through an automaton in the shape of the girl.*

*However, what had come back was not entirely perfect. Due the craven processes used to revive her, ‘Metal Alice’ has become something of a walking portal to the seam of the afterlife, continually drawing the influence of dark spirits as a result -- her most prominent effect being her drawing of various ‘phantasmic metal’ objects from her body, from parasols, to scissors, to chainsaws. This paranatural risk increases during time of duress, and it is expected for faculty personnel and students to NOT provoke her or question her nature under any circumstances. She is simply Alice. Let’s keep it that way.”*

# Hot★Shot
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-H
* **Name:** ███ ██ ██████
* **Birthdate:** November 23
* **Nationality:** China (🇨🇳)
* **Species:** Human
* **Power:** Burning Soul
* **Likes:** Movies, working out, drama
* **Dislikes:** Attention (specifically when other people get it), laziness

*“Hot★Shot is an up-and-coming super who REALLY wants to make himself known. A champion of fighting tournaments since preteen years, he’s built up a reputation of being an intense braggart with a delinquent streak who enjoys always being the center of attention, but is so genuinely talented and capable in a way that enables him to justify his ego. His most recent practice in the ‘Burning Soul’ technique and empowering his martial arts ability to literally fiery extents have done little to extinguish his spirit.*

*Important notice: Hot★Shot has a history of poor conduct in previous superpower institutes, including bullying of other classmates, bringing dangerous weapons on school property, and starting underground ‘fistfight clubs’ with fellow students. Such behavior is not to be tolerated, but be advised that attempting to discipline him may quickly escalate to aggressive confrontation at a moment’s notice. As such, it is recommended to enable minor offenses to be tolerated within reason, such as alteration of his school uniform (i.e. wearing sunglasses or removing his sleeves) or sitting backwards in his chair.”*

# Vioelectrolysis
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-I
* **Name:** ████████ █████████
* **Birthdate:** October 10
* **Nationality:** Botswana (🇧🇼)
* **Species:** Human
* **Power:** Super-Intelligence/Chemical Creation
* **Likes:** Animals, painting, social interaction
* **Dislikes:** Reading, chalkboards

*“The standout luminary of this current class, Vioelectrolysis is an intensely progressive prodigy with aspirations of becoming a pioneer in ‘super-sciences’ as soon as possible. Having been the apprentice of the notorious Dr. ██████████, Vioelectrolysis enrolled herself in our Institute for the dual purpose of further engaging with the various sciences of supers and paranatural study, as well as ‘surrounding herself with those in [her] actual age group for psycho-social development.’*

*Her current pursuit of note involves ‘Project Mitochondria’, a large device described as a cross between ‘a paint mixer, a fire extinguisher, and a medieval flail’ for the purposes of near-instantly synthesizing various chemical substances of paranatural and anomalous capabilities, from physical empowerment, elemental manipulation, psycho-emotional stimulation, and others as publicly documented in her extensive ‘thesis-in-progress’. It is also extremely heavy. It has been permitted to be carried on school grounds, but only operated under certain conditions regarding science and combat classes. (Note: Questions as to what ultimate purpose it serves will be unanswered; I’ve asked her before, and I’m not convinced that even she herself knows).”*

# White Slate
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-J
* **Name:** N/A
* **Birthdate:** May 17
* **Nationality:** Greece (🇬🇷)
* **Species:** Animated Statue
* **Power:** Stone Touch
* **Likes:** Abstract arts, philosophy, zoology
* **Dislikes:** Small talk, music

*“White Slate is one of our most unusual enrolments of this class, heavily informed by the tumultuous circumstances from his creation to him being discovered by our scouts. According to Slate himself, he was created by accident -- the result of an artist (whose identity has yet to be determined) who sculpted him out of an anomalous, marble-like material, resulting in him becoming sapient and animate during the creation process. The artist died shortly afterwards, Slate reporting it be from an act of self-defense, though the veracity of this remains under investigation. Due to being incomplete, several features of Slate’s ostensibly ‘human’ appearance are undefined, most prominently his lack of a full face.*

*In addition to being a paranatural lifeform of undetermined origin, Slate has the conscious ability to temporarily transmute any object he touches into stone, including (para)humans. This is a reversible, but nevertheless dangerous power that is to not be treated lightly, with all staff and students expected to follow proper distancing procedures to ensure safety. Slate is an otherwise well-behaved and obedient student who largely keeps to himself, but his social, mental, and indeed moral development is something to be noted as he defines more of himself throughout his time in our Institute.”*",1b1fe1n,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1b1fe1n/class_404_student_file_summaries_intro_to_rapture/,[]

Genre: Online 2D shooter. So, it was a lobby of maybe 10-20 online players and it was 2d. You could control your player and move using the keyboard and aim using your mouse

Estimated year of release: Not sure but i'm pretty sure I played this in the mid-2000s, maybe 2006 or so.

Graphics/art style: Not sure but if I remember somewhat (I could be completely wrong), the character you play as was dressed in military gear much like master chief from halo. I think, all the players were in different coloured gear as well.

Notable characters: Not sure

Notable gameplay mechanics: You could control your player and move using the keyboard and aim using your mouse - I think i recall there being a laser to show where your gun was pointing but again, I could be wrong

Other details: Hard to explain, but I think you could use your character to go into different rooms (or screens rather) if you went down a corridor or something - I guess think similar to zelda on NES (just to be clear this game was 2d, not topdown perspective).

META Loadouts?,"So I've been seeing more and more posts on multiple platforms saying ""This is the best loadout to use in Helldivers 2"" and i was wondering, how is there a META loadout when there are so many that i wouldn't use in certain situations.

I normally use: Breaker 225, machine pistol, Eagle Airstrike, Orbital Rail cannon, support weapon rail cannon and a supply pack. I've had no issues because i normally try and ""focus"" the bigger enemies but also have the shotgun and pistol for ""unarmoured"" stuff.

I used to use the autocannon but found without a loader, it isn't great long term, I've tried the ""bigger"" Orbital and Eagle strikes but found they weren't accurate enough when i needed (difficulty 4 - 6)

If it's an Evacuate civilians mission, i'm not using airstrikes for fear of killing them constantly and i'd probably take a minefield to put down near where the enemies spawn to stop the melee guys getting near but when i'm running round the map on a larger mission, i don't feel i'm in one place long enough to justify a minefield.

When i'm loading into a mission that's in progress, i'm more than happy to change what i'm taking for what the group needs. If i see 2 rail cannons/ recoilless rifle/ autocannons, i'm not going to take one because we need an LMG for the ""low level"" bots and bugs, likewise, if there is more than 1 supply pack, what's the point of 2? it just means we are both ""fighting"" to refill it from the resupply. Seeing 1 person with a Guard dog does annoy me a little because half the time it ends up hitting me and the bug/ bot next to me but i'm not going to leave because of something a player can't control and like using to cover their back if they are solo.

Other than the Breaker 225 which i think is a little too strong for what it is (yes i know i use it) is there really a ""these are the only stratagems to use""  when it comes to completing difficulty 7 - 9? and are people just making these posts as clickbait things or is there a genuine ""these guns are better because XYZ""?

Apologies for the long post, just a question that's popped up in by head over the past weekend.

There are so many different possible ways a team could combine their 16 strategem slots there\'s no way they\'ve all been explored in depth.  \n\nJust one example:  *Don\'t bring mortars, you\'ll just kill your teammates!*  Mostly true against bugs that frequently at close range, but against bots?

Ask yourself how many times have you been surrounded by bugs and are limited to 1 shot trying to take out the charger first. Flamer problem solved. Just remember to keep moving backwards and not standing stationary when using it. And railgun at extraction is laughable but that's another story."", 'Well, part of it is clickbait of course. Your average player wants to win, and does not want to think.

There *are* certain weapons that are best in class, and have no real competition currently. You can win with other weapons, but if you want to apply the least amount of effort, and some would say have the most fun, you just run the meta.\n\nObviously the Breaker. The best primary bar none. There are a few guns that are kinda close, like the Scorcher against bots, but the Breaker is more or less the best weapon in the game. Whether it\'s a ""nerf the Breaker"" issue, or a ""buff everything else"" issue, is something I\'m undecided on, personally.\n\nThe Railgun. Also best in class. Huge ammo pool, huge damage, mobile reload, versatile to the point of making most other single target weapons obsolete. And it doesn\'t need a backpack, which immediately gives it a huge advantage over something like the Autocannon or the Recoilless Rifle.\n\nThese two are the outlier. I\'m not sure anything else is as ironclad in the meta as those. Personal shield, you could argue, maybe.']"
"I have a stupid idea for escort carriers, but hear me out","**The basic idea**

We recently got the USN support carriers, which have two of their three aircraft types as consumable squadrons. This gave me an idea. How about we make a branch whose offensive power against surface ships is limited to that?

Now I can already hear you frantically typing into the comments how that ruins the game, because we can't deplane those carriers. And yes, valid concern, which is why my idea was to limit those to two types as well. Hopefully in a way that limits damage output to surface ships.

Now they should still get a third aircraft type, and here's where the main part of my idea comes in. Controllable ASW aircraft. This will be the gimmicky part. The idea was to have a squadron of modified TBM Avengers. They drop depth charges over a wide area.

This sounds pretty boring right now, but the important part to this idea is their improved spotting against submarines. With the words of WG themselves, LET'S IMAGINE they get airborne radar on these ships specialised in spotting submarines. They'd get spotting equivalent to surface ships against submarines whenever they're surfaced or at periscope depth, as well as normal air spotting against submarines at 30m depth, aka the first fully submerged level. The only way to stay hidden as a submarine would be max depth.

Before anyone complains about realism, submerged submarines can spot aircraft, so shut it.

The ships would get good concealment (they're small ships), but weak AA and secondaries. Big weaknesses will be their slow speed and low survivability (could be improved if that makes them too easy to kill for the enemy CV right away). Maybe they could get improved auto-ASW, but I'll ignore that for now.

This would be a classic ""create a problem, sell the solution"" to submarines and poor AA performance, even when grouping up. The combat instructions are there to not make this line a burden to the team if there are no submarines either left or in the game.

Just in general I think the AA-Radar could be a decent consumable, be it with lower range for normal surface ships.

To people that will mention that this will reduce the submarine gimmick of being invisible:

1 - That is a good thing

2 - Unlike radared DDs (which have to get out of radar range), submarines will be able to dive deeper to avoid spotting, and this here requires ""line of sight"".

And if they don't massively improve the gameplay, at least they're neat historical ships to collect (little paper was used). I know that I will at least not fuck up the game more than WG is going to already.

"The Machine Gun is so close to perfection. So, so* close.","It punches through medium armor. It acts as a rock for your team, in those massive engagements with a bunch of bugs, bots, you name it. It is the first weapon any Diver gets access to.

Why in God's name is the magazine size so astronomically fucking tiny, and why can we only get 2 mags for it? The Stalwart lacks the punch necessary for proper Horde control, the Machine Gun just lacks bullets.

Read that again,

The MACHINE GUN lacks BULLETS.

Having to stay put to reload? I can live with that, I'm an Autocannon Enjoyer, taking a knee to reload is just a fact of life. Makes me actually have to use my frontal lobe to not reload when there's 8 hunters infront of me.

But gosh, the Stalwart lacks punch the Machine Gun provides but the absolutely pathetic magazine size and even worse- carrying capacity. As someone who loves the MG, even in higher difficulties, I feel absolutely obligated to bring a supply pack if I want to make this work since you blink and are already out of ammo.

Please give this thing some love. It is so close, so tantalizingly close to being perfect. It is one of the painfully few options that can actually respond to Medium armor head-on without trouble, and crowd/Horde control being limited to ""Just use your breaker shotgun and Eagle airstrikes"" sucks.

How do you as Black Americans feel about the 2nd Amendment?,"Black Americans have a complicated relationship with the 2nd Amendment. For many Black people in history, firearms were the only thing that stood between them and white supremacy, with many Black groups taking up arms to protect their communities from racist violence and bolster civil rights struggles ([An excellent book on the subject](https://www.hoplofobia.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Charles-Cobb-This-Nonviolent-Stuffll-Get-You-Killed.pdf)); likewise, white lawmakers have often implemented prejudice gun laws specifically to disarm Black power, most famously with Regan and the Black Panthers. Many groups in America still take great pride in the rich history of Black gun ownership([NAAGA](https://naaga.co/), for example).

However, it's impossible to ignore that gun violence is a massive problem in America, including in major Black communities. Also, the issue with rights is they extend to everyone, regardless of their moral character, and we have seen many times how white supremacists use guns to carry out atrocities against Black people (both historically in cases such as Black Wall Street and in modern times such as Charleston and Buffalo). The availability of guns also means that far-right groups can more easily arm themselves and carry out acts of domestic terror; both the Obama and Trump presidencies led to an increase in far-right militias like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, with these groups often receiving far less harassment and surveillance then Black gun clubs, even though they represent the biggest threat to American democracy, and carry out the majority of political violence in America.

So my question is, how do you feel about the 2nd Amendment? Are you a gun owner or favour gun control, and how do you weigh the benefits of Black groups arming themselves vs the consequences of far-right groups doing the same?",1b1dfw1,0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/askblackpeople/comments/1b1dfw1/how_do_you_as_black_americans_feel_about_the_2nd/,"[""I just don't like guns period.

All I want is really for appropriate vetting processes to happen to acquire guns, as well as taking a bigger look at mental health services in schools, so that there are less shootings overall. We have the most shootings of that nature, and it would be a fool to ignore statistics. \n\nPlus guns are often used as an intimidation tactic, rather than actual use. Let's not forget that black men have gotten killed by police (despite having registered guns in their own house to protect against criminals) for having said guns, even if not used for nefarious purposes like crimes. \n\nSo they have their pros and cons. But I still believe there should be a more rigorous vetting process to obtain a gun. Not take them away, but make them more challenging to get."", ""I know many Black gun owners and I support the 2A. I have not seen any  animosity at White shooting ranges. So as a Black man , no, guns are not a problem. I would feel less safe if guns were taken away from Black people with 'gun control'"", 'Support it. Deacons of the South, BPP and other militant Black groups wouldn’t exist without guns.\n\nEven if the 2nd amendment didn’t exist Understand that anti Black groups would still have access guns and even though us having access to firearms doesn’t even the odds it is enough of a threat of retaliation to dissuade violence.\n\nIn terms of gun violence in Black communities. It’s part cultural flaw and part flaw of our laws. Most of those YOUNG people are not legal gun owners or they have access to AKs at age 18 without proper training and screening- imo that is the problem, not guns.', 'I’m a gun owner and I’m also in favor of greater gun control. Just because the 2A grants us a right doesn’t mean it should be totally unrestrained.\n\nI’d like to see ownership of semi-automatic weapons require some form of licensing, safety training, and demonstrated proficiency. Something similar to the hours required to get a pilot’s license', 'Useless amendment. Black people get killed for legally owning guns frequently enough for me to hate the idea of it regardless. Clearly the amendment is working given that so many of us are still for it.']"
"PS5 controller, no skills, no money, funny smells and cheap soldering iron... Time to quit?!","I think the title says it all! I was so excited to fix my PS5 controller with stick drift. I have all the parts and bought a £20 iron from Ebay but it's gone horribly wrong! 

It has such a bad smell when I turned it on and I wish I hadn't bought a cheap made in China iron that I'm now afraid to use! The metal went a funny colour and I'm so frightened of burns and fires!

I don't know what the solder that came with it is made of. I don't know what flux is or how to use it. I don't have the cleaning done either, or anything else I'm missing but don't realise. Nor was I wearing any protective gear. 

I have chronic health problems and quite severe disability so I'm really anxious about the impact of fumes. I had honestly thought I could just heat it up, the solder would melt. I had the wick and the desoldering pump. Swap the part, job done. How naive was I?! 

But I went up to 400f and nothing melted. It smelt so weird I was scared to keep using it. Everyone says its flux fumes etc but this seemed to smell just from heating the iron. I have read here about using better quality solder. And I read online before you should buy expensive tips even for a cheap gun. 

I've spent (wasted) £40 on all the parts and tools and a new controller would be £60. I wanted the satisfaction, but is it time to hang up my soldering towel?! Or do I persevere? In which case what tools do I need and do I need to exchange for a better quality gun? I'm in the UK if anyone has recommendations.",1b1db5s,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1b1db5s,"['Just set it aside for a while and do some actual research on how to solder, before trying again.

You need to see someone actually doing it, while explaining it.\n\nThere are plenty of good YouTube channels that explain the whole soldering process. I recommend ""The Art of Repair.""

Full Rant Mode- Blaze in the Closet from her Mommy,"WTF is this crap?

Blaze spent over a year with Linc's hand involuntarily up her skirt the entire time. The biggest sleaze in Port Charles, he made 90s Sonny look like a gentleman. Mommy was totally okay with that. 

But OMG, if mommy found out Blaze kissed a girl...   Plus, it is not 1990 anymore. No one cares outside of a few snake handling churches and a few Mosques and Synagogues stuck in the 1700s. 

Plus, Kristina does not have a security troop from Sonny? The front desk gave up Blaze's room number and didn't call up first?

The ONLY (caps because I am yelling) thing that would save this story would be if woke screamer activist Molly4 uses The Closet, plus whatever fallout comes from it, to go to court and say Kristina is no bueno to be a mom, and takes the TJ baby. Of course, the entire time Alexis will be there with a sour look on her face like she hasn't pooped for three days, and somehow NLG will talk Frank into another gun control lecture coming out of Alexis's mouth. ",1b1c3ko,0,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeneralHospital/comments/1b1c3ko/full_rant_mode_blaze_in_the_closet_from_her_mommy/,"[""We never saw her mother before yesterday so I don't know how you know she was ok with her daughter being harassed or that she even knew. I had a friend pass away recently. Everyone pretty much knew he was gay but he never admitted it or talked about it. His family also didn't know as far as I know. He would go on trips with his boyfriend and the only pictures he posted were of just him and never tagged the other person. So if you think no one cares and everyone is out of the closet and prejudice doesn't still exist I think you need to open your eyes. There are still kids being kicked out of their house for being gay. I have another friend whose child is gay. She's an adult now but her father doesn't talk to her. He left his wife and kids for another woman but I guess that's ok, you just can't be gay. So rude awakening and welcome to the real world I guess, the storyline isn't as out of touch as you may want to believe."", ""I guess you missed the part where Kristina pointed out Blaze's mom is super strict religious apparently? So that was the reason given for why she was in the closet. I think her mom is here for whatever Cyrus has going on and that she has promised her daughter the same way Willow's mom gave her to Shiloh."", 'I don’t know if she ever told her mom Linc was sexually abusing her. She didn’t say anything until the nurses ball because that was part of the industry. \n\nHer family is religious so she hasn’t come out. Different cultures are not as open with this.\n\nI’m Asian and not gay but had breast cancer. In the Asian culture it’s taboo to talk about. I’m one to educate and my mom doesn’t mind sharing so I told my story. Others I know are super secretive and embarrassed. \n\nYes it’s 2024 but not everyone is accepting in their families or with their religion.\n\nAnd culturally mami is used. Was it said a lot, yes. But it’s the same when Kristina was taking to sonny and kept calling him dad. The writers like to emphasize in case we forget', 'Her mom was a bit rude from the moment she walked in. When I was 20 in the early 90\'s, my folks came home early from a vacation and caught me naked on the couch with another dude. There was an awkward moment of fumbling for clothes. Instead of freaking out, my mom said, ""I guess you boys weren\'t expecting us back so soon"".  Then they both laughed. So my coming out was uneventful.', 'I doubt Blaze\'s mother was ""totally okay"" with her daughter being sexually assaulted by her boss.

Kristina and Blaze are sweet. The worst that can happen is the stress of Blaze's Mom sending Kristina into a pregnancy scare.

I am looking forward to Alexis and Blaze's Mom going head to head."", 'I’m confused why the sisters would have a custody battle when K is a surrogate?', 'The whole Blaze story is clicheAF', 'Wow, Dan and Chris were really trashing the show before they left.', 'I don’t mind the coming out story, but Blaze calling her mom “Mommy” grated. It was the delivery.', 'Lets face it odds are that ""never"" happened anymore the way GH likes to drop and ignore past shown history on this show.', ""I don't mind that it's a coming out story, I think it makes sense Blaze would be closeted given her career and family, but I think we can all agree it's a poorly written coming out story (because the writing for this whole show sucks these days). It feels like a generic copy & paste take more appropriate for an insecure 20-something and doesn't seem true to who these specific characters really are. This is successful mega popstar and a cool bartender mob kid, both in their 30's having lived through a lot--like why is it so cheesy? It doesn't match up.\n\nAt least they're jumping right in and it'll hopefully be over soon and the story can move on to something else. I'm hoping this is just the most awkward part."", ""Well. If you've never experienced being shut out, thrown out, beat up or anything like that for being gay I can see how you may not understand. \n\nThere's still a stigma that if a man was raped by another man people accuse him of being gay. \n\nA former student of mine was repeatedly raped by someone in the community and never told because he didn't want his dad to think that meant he was gay. \n\nI don't know you at all. But maybe you should be thankful you've never understood why blaze was afraid. \n\nKristina was afraid to tell Sonny as well. \n\nAnd I doubt mom was okay with Linc. But a lot of homophobic people would be able to blame linc for that. Whereas being gay is a sin. Being assaulted isn't your fault. Being gay would be---TO A HOMOPHOBE NOT ME. \n\nit's absolutely frustrating that people still think this this. But reality is they do. And this could be a great social story for a lot of people out there who may be afraid to come out. Especially in different cultures that may not be as accepting."", 'Religious rules often get ""bent"" once families realize someone they thoroughly love and adore is LGBTQIA2.

Soo...PS4 WZ isn't for me. I made a lot of people laugh.,"So for starters, i'm a gamer dad with maybe 2 hours a day i can play on the PS4 since the big TV is occupied all day. Anyway, i've played mostly like... Dark Souls and stuff on PS4, some Resident Evil etc. I'm not good at all at FPS, i'm slightly more competent on PC, but the amount of hackers I come up against makes me look like a complete noob (i've only played warzone 2 about a week on PC)

Anyway, here I am ready to bust some heads on PS4 after the kid goes to sleep, wife watching me, i'm ready to impress her with my mad bronze rank skills, when I land and pick up my first contract. Grab me a fat ass assault rifle (Rare quality of course) and proceed to look for the first joker who wants to start a fight.

Well some unlucky fool decided to enter MY HOUSE i was pillaging at the wrong time, He got a couple of pops of lead, surely scared out of his mind. He ran out of the hosue to put on his chest panty armor plates and I confidently followed him, all the while swaying wildly like a raging alcholoic who can barely walk as I swerve all over the place due to my horrible controller skills. Anyway, I hop out the window with my massive muscles and dude just threw on his last plate. I grabbed my bad ass assault rifle so hard and charged that mofo and took a swing. He dodged quickly out of my melee range and I saw him start to aim his weapon.

At this point, I had popped my R3 button so hard the wind must have knocked him back, and because my coordination is so piss poor I start swinging my weapon in a circle as I'm trying to shoot my gun but my brain is for some reason spammin R3. Needless to say, I end this epic encounter in a pool of my own blood.

Watching his playback of my horrible demise, I see him throw on his plate, watch my awesoness jump out the window, see myself take a swing at him and then keep swinging in a circle like i'm a fucking baton twirler or something while he effortlessly lays me out.

I'd like to say this is a one-off occurence, but this happens around 2-3 times per game.

"Sometimes I think my boss is trying to psychologically torture me, and I wonder if it’s psychological torture TO THEM, if it doesn’t bother me.","The face, the stare, the evil look, the aggressive whisper. Just like my dad did.

I also get tormented by SCARY FACES in nightmares sometimes, once I just knew the old man was evil, merciless, continuing to mock me while I screamed. Another was still human-like, but unnaturally, an open mouth frown staring at me as I shined a light on it in the dark. I woke up screaming, terrified, it was stuck in my mind for a few minutes, as if it was still present, literally inside my mind. I prayed and looked up Bible verses.

Another was straight up demonic, my mom was possessed by a demonic clown.

Sometimes everything and everyone just looks terrifying, and evil.

I even fantasized about ripping everyone’s face off, because whatever has been torturing me has specifically made it a point to distort and warp faces, ruin the entire concept of faces, and that’s so sad, and you can’t go through life without seeing faces (unless you’re blind, but that would mean other senses strengthened, and they could still torture me by showing themselves directly into my mind. Since I’ve lived 28 years with eye sight, I’d probably continue dreaming visually, I’d assume).

That might make for a good horror story, if it hasn’t already, someone ripping faces off because they all look terrifying and evil, even though they didn’t use to.

I wonder how everyone would react if they saw me just scream and freak out, maybe pleading for Jesus Christ (sigh, I still doubt and lack faith in Him, and I really don’t want to follow all the commandments like no sex until marriage, because marriage is very unlikely for me now, so sometimes I watch porn, down to once a week or less, and eventually if I had the chance, I’d fornicate, because it’d feel validating and I’d feel at least somewhat more normal, experience what virtually everyone does, much younger than me).

I know police and EMS would be called, and they’d probably detain me and forcibly put me in a psych ward, if they don’t just shoot me first (I don’t know if it’d be fatal though, I might reach for a gun just to get myself shot, especially at that point) and I wouldn’t even have my crappy job anymore, that’s low skilled, low paying, and cutting hours often!

And then of course I’d lose my health insurance, meaning it’d cost $300+ to even see the psychiatrist to approve all my refills (GoodRX would help that, but I don’t think they discount actually seeing the doctor) and I’d be getting those BS 3-4 figure bills just for being admitted into a hospital and blood tests and all that shit. And if I have to suddenly withdrawal from everything, that’s it, nobody is surviving that. And the mofos in the mental hospital will just refuse to give me my meds and force me to immediately take new ones, and then probably discharge me a couple or few weeks later and I couldn’t take them anymore. 

All these fucking pills, already too many, already toxicity over my brain, they over complicated my brain chemistry, and all the damn doctors want to is put me on more pills. I take four, I can’t take anymore!

When I go to sleep I have to go to these BS dimensions with UGLY AND DARK COLORS AND LIGHTING, AND CREEPY UNCANNY ATMOSPHERE. Yeah that’s right, I’m criticizing things that torture me, I sure the hell am! 

If you’re real why are you allowing this God? Have I really been that terrible of a person? Is it because I’m unwilling to commit to voluntary celibacy, even to the point of never self pleasure? I’m 28, I feel I missed out, I feel accepting that now, and embracing, is giving into being tricked. 

I wasn’t going to fit into your traditional “wife and kids” marriage God, you should know that. If you really wanted me to be celibate for most if not all of my life, you should have made me asexual. I don’t even want kids now, not that there is biologically any time for that, nor am I even fit to be a father, come on man you know this. 

Even if I got a girlfriend/wife, there’s a good chance she gonna cheat on me eventually, even if I’m somehow doing better than I am now, most relationships are temporary, most marriages end in divorce.

But what are these ugly bootleg worlds in the dreams when I sleep? Why they look like that? Why did my sister turn into a guy and shove their dick in my face while my parents just stood and watched? And then my mom was possessed by a demonic clown? Why? WTFH is this shit?

It’s not even clear if these are real spirits or just my own fucked up brain. 

My brain can’t even keep up with all the stupid intrusive thoughts and compulsions anymore. They got so out of control and overwhelming I mentally cannot even keep track of them all anymore, they just get, backlogged, by infinitely more………

I feel like I’m the only person on this planet to experience what I experience. Why can’t I just have “normal” problems? Why do I have to see all these freakish dimensions with different laws of physics and rules of reality?

How can I heal, if there’s no healthy state to go back to? Like a person with Alzheimer’s (which runs in my family by the way, again, you know this God) has nothing to go back to, because plaque is literally physically eating their brain away. 

The brain can’t just be reset to “default settings”, even under normal conditions.

"Dwayne Jackson, 19, Michael Jackson's fourth and youngest child, to take on first acting role, playing ""Dalton Edwards"" in ""GTA 6 rival"" action adventure mystery game ""New Roswell"". Set on a high-resolution recreation of the Greater Houston area, Dalton begins to suspect people are being replaced...","
[**FICTION**]


Dwayne Jackson, 19 - Michael Jackson's fourth and youngest child - is to take on his first acting role.

Playing ""Dalton Edwards"" in the action-adventure mystery game, *New Roswell* - which is being touted as a rival to the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 - the story follows 17 year old Dalton - who lives in Pasadena, TX - who has just got his first car and begins to suspect that people across the Greater Houston area are being replaced...by aliens in the aftermath of a satellite crashing into Burnet Bay.

Set on a highly realistic high resolution recreation of the Greater Houston area, developers boast that players can ""do everything you can do in GTA 6...but on a far, far larger map, an enormous map, a huge map"". However, be warned, committing crime and being identified will lead to XP being deducted and notoriety increasing and will hamper your own private investigation as you - playing Dalton - attempt to determine whether people are slowly being replaced by extraterrestrials across Greater Houston.

Playing highschooler Dalton Edwards, you have the freedom to do many things across the map and you work together with both fellow highschoolers, random adults, trusted LEO contacts (but, beware, committing crime will burn bridges and make it harder to gather info and intelligence), contacts in the military, investigative journalists and even criminals. Your first vehicle is given to you for free, but any additional vehicles have to be purchased. Developers boast the game will ""have a larger and more realistic car selection than Rockstar's GTA 6"". You can also store vehicles in various lockups from Downtown Houston (where it is expensive to store)...to Sunnyside (where it is cheaper but more dangerous). Dalton's family home is in Pasadena, but he is able to crash with friends across Houston and the more relationships be builds, the more places that become available. Later in the game, he turns 18 - and depending on where he got the money from - he is now able to begin purchasing his own properties; the game's realism even allows him to look on realtors' websites and book showings or attend open house events and speak to realtors. 

As Dalton lives life in Greater Houston, he can either proceed in life as a ""law-abiding citizen"" (although sometimes his investigation may lead to dangerous situations and trespassing)...or build up a criminal network. Beware that taking the criminal route may lead to increased notoriety, more danger and the revoking of access to LEO contacts. Whilst Dalton can commit a multitude of crimes, beware that committing serious crimes such as homicide will lead to a dramatic ""Wanted"" scenario and a dramatic cinematic showing a news bulletin, with Dalton's face plastered across the news, is shown. If you are identified, cops will chase and air support will be called in  The pursuits are tougher, more cinematic and dangerous, so players may shy away from committing serious felonies. Shooting a cop is a big no-no and a dramatic ""11-99"" code will be blasted, with various dramaric cinematics showing cops responding and searching for you and whether the cop survives or not is immaterial; it'll feel like the whole world is looking for Dalton. Members of the public will quickly shop Dalton to the cops for rewards, German Shepherd sniffer dogs will chase you on foot (if you're really unlucky and flee on foot), roadblocks and checkpoints will also be in place.

Dalton can also shop criminals to the authorities as well himself and there are various activities going on across the map, from small activities such as assaults and thefts to larger robberies, shootings and murders. Whilst a little more unrealistic, but nevertheless ""exciting"", players can turn vigilante and help cops apprehend dangerous suspects and fugitives. This will boost XP and lead to better and stronger relationships with LEO contacts and investigative journalists to help you with your investigation. But increassd notoriety will scare off contacts such as investigative journalists and random law-abiding citizens.

Whilst Dalton can steal any car in the Greater Houston area, if he is identified as a carjacking suspect, notoriety will increase and the more cars he steals, the greater the likelihood he will achieve a ""Wanted"" status. A loophole includes wearing a balaclava and is permitted in the game, but if you are spotted by passersby and bystanders, they will become suspicious and visibly react saying things like ""Huh, that guy is up to no good"" and some pedestrians may even say ""I might call the cops"". When Dalton steals cars, it's not an easy cake walk like in GTA V and GTA 6; no, Dalton then has to go to one of his criminal contacts to change the plates and color and only then can he actually own the car and pimp it up at the various auto shops across the map. He can also sell stolen vehicles, but it's not very lucrative.

As Dalton goes around the Greater Houston area investigating his ""extraterrestrial replacement conspiracy theory"", he can also make VLOGs and live videos which he can post to in-game social media networks. In-game social media networks can either be used for good or bad things. Dalton can gain more contacts who will supply much-needed info and intelligence (e.g ""yeah, my brother's been acting weird lately"" or ""my teacher hasn't come into school for days now"" or ""Tristan used to skateboard and be cool but now just stands in the parking lot of the abandoned Palisades mall just staring up at the sun everyday - started after the satellite crashsd"" etc) and depending on how strong and detailed the investigation is, this can actually lead to more missions and mini-investigations (e.g. ""Investigating Tristan the skateboarder"", following him, doing recon work, speaking to his friends and family and people in his neighborhood etc).

Dalton can also be mischevious and use in-game social media for more mischevious activities. For example, he can take part in the notorious and dangerous viral ""Jeepers Creepers"" social media challenge which involves players doing dangerous things, which get more and more dangerous each time. If Dalton is identified, however, his notoriety will increase.

The game's map is teeming with activities and life and there are billboards, malls you can walk into and shop in, gas stations, 7-11s, car and motorcycle dealerships, museums, aquariums and zoos you can actualky go into and explore and many explorable locations. There are 4 strip clubs and 5 nightclubs and bars on the map, but some will not let you in unless you are 18 or 21. When Dalton turns 18 later on in the game, he can freely enter most adult entertainment venues. Whilst Dalton can get fake IDs from criminal contacts - he actually has to physically go to a contact's home, make small talk, smoke a joint and then call in a favor or pay his contact to get the ID - players are advised against doing this. When entering as a 17 year old with a fake ID, he can only see topless strippers and poledancers, but doesn't have access to private dancers (dancers and strippers will say something like ""you look a bit young, baby, I ain't gettin' in trouble for no kid"" and he'll be denied a private dance). When Dalton turns 18 in the game, he'll be able to get privste dancer and even have sex, but sex scenes are softcore, with no genitals shown and only bare-chested women. Dalton can also meet women outside of adult entertainment venues and go on dates and whatnot.

There are also police stations, sheriffs offices, firehouses and hospitals. Dalton can get supplies at hospitals and can even eavesdrop on the radio and pick up injured people and transport them to hospitals. Some parts of hospitals are restricted and trespassing will increase notoriety and lead to security and even police being called. Some mini-investigations may require you to go to locations on the map which are restricted (e.g. ""The injured roofer"" mission; Brett fell from several stories high whilst working on the roof of an apartment building and was transported to hospital but miraculously recovered upon reaching hospital).

Weapons are available in the game and can be bought lawfully. In order to gain gun permits, you must go to a designated state shooting range and pass various tests to obtain firearms certificates for each class of firearm. Open-carry is permitted in the game's version of Greater Houston, but ""wielding a weapon in a threatening manner"" may lead to cops being called if you can be identified. Pedestrians will flee and scramble to safety if you start pointing guns at them.

Dalton can also gain his pilot's license, which will grant him access to vatious airports and private airfields where he can fly helicopters and planes. Accessing any airport or private airfield without a license or sufficient authorization (e.g. ""bribe"" or ""favor"") can lead to increased notoriety and an increased likelihood of attaining a ""Wanted"" status.

Dalton can also take on various jobs across the map to boost income, from law-abiding work to criminal gigs and operations. Players are advised to conceal their identity (e.g. wearing a balaclava or face mask) when partaking in criminal activities.

At various stages, playing as Dalton, players get to see singular activities and events such as a tornado or an escaped creature. There will be news bulletins and various responses (e.g. stormchasers tailing a tornado and animal control and cops attempting to apprehend a dangerous creature). Later on in the game, playing as Dalton, you actually get to join the rather aptly named ""Fantastic Four"" (a famous stormchasing group) and there are various mini missions which involve chasing storms and various other ""weather-related phenomena"".

In the game, there are six news stations and you can watch realistic news bulletins and news segments in your home, whilst crashing at friend's pads, through the window of electrical goods store (or inside) and in your car's in-built entertainment system. You can also watch trailers for fake videogames and movies and TV zeries and even read short books. There are myltiple theaters on the map, but only three movies are available: a 17-minute superhero flick ""Saving America"" which follows injured Seattle cop Ben Dylan develop superpowers (tge graphics are tge same as the game's realistic graphics); a set of three 4-minute long animation ""Harry and Scrappy"", which follows two talking cats causing mischief across New York; ""The President's Men"", an 8-minute theatrical movie following Francis Clayton as he saves the First Lady and the President's son from domestic terrorists (again, graphics the same as the main game).

Playing as Dalton, you also have access to bicycles, skateboards and Segways and can buy, customize and trade skateboards and bicycles. Dalton can also buy smartphones, televisions, speakers, iPods, record players and vinyl records and there are various music tracks and in-game radio stations available featuring both real music from real bands and artists to custom game music.

Apart from other jobs, Dalton can even try his hand at acting in the game and take on roles as an extra in commercials and TV shows, but beware, if he takes on  bigger acting roles, he will not be able to commit any crimes unless he quits acting altogether. At some points in the game, Dalton can see himself on a handful of billboards and in various 30-second commercials (for example, advertising ""TotalFresh, California's favourite toothpaste"", in a ""Manny's"" advert, ""Texas'favorite fast food chain""). As he builds up his portfolio, jobs increase in payouts and he gets calls to act in bigger roles and star in longer productions. Players are advised to try their hand in acting later on in the game as acting may distract from the main story campaign (i.e ""investigating Dalton's extraterrestrial replacement conspiracy theory"").

Dalton can also attend soccer, baseball, basketball and football games and athletics meets - but these are limited in number and frequency and he has to buy tickets before they are sold out. Early on in the game, he is also part of his high school's swim and track team, but is injured during a fight with a mugger and stops competing. Dalton also has access to his school gym, a gym in his family's garage and equipment at friend's pads and players can build up individual muacles in the game and even ""bulk up"" until a certain point.

There are many lakes and bodies of water around the map and players can fish, swim, sail or go jet-skiing with in-game characters. Doing various activities with in-game characters can ""boost morale"", ""decrease notoriety"", ""strengthen bonds with contacts"" (thereby helping with progress in the campaign investigation) and reveal secret locations on the map.

Dwayne Jackson - born Dwayne Michael Ash Jackson - was born in 2005 as the son of famous popstar Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson superfan Lucy Reynolds. Dwayne's likeness is used as the basis for the character of Dalton Edwards and he is the language actor for both the main English audio and the secondary French audio (he began learning French as a toddler). Spanish, German and Japanese audio will be the only other audio languages available in the game, but there will be subtitle options and interface options available for 7 additional languages.

"Dwayne Jackson, 19, Michael Jackson's fourth and youngest child, to take on first acting role, playing ""Dalton Edwards"" in ""GTA 6 rival"" action adventure mystery game ""New Roswell"". Set on a high-resolution recreation of the Greater Houston area, Dalton begins to suspect people are being replaced...","Dwayne Jackson, 19 - Michael Jackson's fourth and youngest child - is to take on his first acting role.

Playing ""Dalton Edwards"" in the action-adventure mystery game, *New Roswell* - which is being touted as a rival to the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 - the story follows 17 year old Dalton - who lives in Pasadena, TX - who has just got his first car and begins to suspect that people across the Greater Houston area are being replaced...by aliens in the aftermath of a satellite crashing into Burnet Bay.

Set on a highly realistic high resolution recreation of the Greater Houston area, developers boast that players can ""do everything you can do in GTA 6...but on a far, far larger map, an enormous map, a huge map"". However, be warned, committing crime and being identified will lead to XP being deducted and notoriety increasing and will hamper your own private investigation as you - playing Dalton - attempt to determine whether people are slowly being replaced by extraterrestrials across Greater Houston.

Playing highschooler Dalton Edwards, you have the freedom to do many things across the map and you work together with both fellow highschoolers, random adults, trusted LEO contacts (but, beware, committing crime will burn bridges and make it harder to gather info and intelligence), contacts in the military, investigative journalists and even criminals. Your first vehicle is given to you for free, but any additional vehicles have to be purchased. Developers boast the game will ""have a larger and more realistic car selection than Rockstar's GTA 6"". You can also store vehicles in various lockups from Downtown Houston (where it is expensive to store)...to Sunnyside (where it is cheaper but more dangerous). Dalton's family home is in Pasadena, but he is able to crash with friends across Houston and the more relationships be builds, the more places that become available. Later in the game, he turns 18 - and depending on where he got the money from - he is now able to begin purchasing his own properties; the game's realism even allows him to look on realtors' websites and book showings or attend open house events and speak to realtors. 

As Dalton lives life in Greater Houston, he can either proceed in life as a ""law-abiding citizen"" (although sometimes his investigation may lead to dangerous situations and trespassing)...or build up a criminal network. Beware that taking the criminal route may lead to increased notoriety, more danger and the revoking of access to LEO contacts. Whilst Dalton can commit a multitude of crimes, beware that committing serious crimes such as homicide will lead to a dramatic ""Wanted"" scenario and a dramatic cinematic showing a news bulletin, with Dalton's face plastered across the news, is shown. If you are identified, cops will chase and air support will be called in  The pursuits are tougher, more cinematic and dangerous, so players may shy away from committing serious felonies. Shooting a cop is a big no-no and a dramatic ""11-99"" code will be blasted, with various dramaric cinematics showing cops responding and searching for you and whether the cop survives or not is immaterial; it'll feel like the whole world is looking for Dalton. Members of the public will quickly shop Dalton to the cops for rewards, German Shepherd sniffer dogs will chase you on foot (if you're really unlucky and flee on foot), roadblocks and checkpoints will also be in place.

Dalton can also shop criminals to the authorities as well himself and there are various activities going on across the map, from small activities such as assaults and thefts to larger robberies, shootings and murders. Whilst a little more unrealistic, but nevertheless ""exciting"", players can turn vigilante and help cops apprehend dangerous suspects and fugitives. This will boost XP and lead to better and stronger relationships with LEO contacts and investigative journalists to help you with your investigation. But increassd notoriety will scare off contacts such as investigative journalists and random law-abiding citizens.

Whilst Dalton can steal any car in the Greater Houston area, if he is identified as a carjacking suspect, notoriety will increase and the more cars he steals, the greater the likelihood he will achieve a ""Wanted"" status. A loophole includes wearing a balaclava and is permitted in the game, but if you are spotted by passersby and bystanders, they will become suspicious and visibly react saying things like ""Huh, that guy is up to no good"" and some pedestrians may even say ""I might call the cops"". When Dalton steals cars, it's not an easy cake walk like in GTA V and GTA 6; no, Dalton then has to go to one of his criminal contacts to change the plates and color and only then can he actually own the car and pimp it up at the various auto shops across the map. He can also sell stolen vehicles, but it's not very lucrative.

As Dalton goes around the Greater Houston area investigating his ""extraterrestrial replacement conspiracy theory"", he can also make VLOGs and live videos which he can post to in-game social media networks. In-game social media networks can either be used for good or bad things. Dalton can gain more contacts who will supply much-needed info and intelligence (e.g ""yeah, my brother's been acting weird lately"" or ""my teacher hasn't come into school for days now"" or ""Tristan used to skateboard and be cool but now just stands in the parking lot of the abandoned Palisades mall just staring up at the sun everyday - started after the satellite crashsd"" etc) and depending on how strong and detailed the investigation is, this can actually lead to more missions and mini-investigations (e.g. ""Investigating Tristan the skateboarder"", following him, doing recon work, speaking to his friends and family and people in his neighborhood etc).

Dalton can also be mischevious and use in-game social media for more mischevious activities. For example, he can take part in the notorious and dangerous viral ""Jeepers Creepers"" social media challenge which involves players doing dangerous things, which get more and more dangerous each time. If Dalton is identified, however, his notoriety will increase.

When Dalton turns 18 in the game, he'll be able to get privste dancer and even have sex, but sex scenes are softcore, with no genitals shown and only bare-chested women.

Learned a truly terrible thing about one of my players and it ended the campaign.,"This is my 1st and only real horror story I've ever really had while playing tabletop. I was in my early 20's when me and a few friends decided we would play DND. We knew exactly nothing about the game and really didn't care to learn so we just found character sheets online, drew up some characters, and got to it. When I say we didn't know anything and were not really willing to learn I mean that very literally. Me and my remaining friends from those two campaigns refer to our time playing them as ""improv with dice."" Specifically just a single d20 we were all passing around and the stats on your sheet. Not much more. Leveling up meant putting one skill point in and making a new ""feat."" Which was basically any new thing you wanted your character to be able to do that you negotiated with the dm. Surprisingly this system, simple as it was, worked really well.

 Our DM did an amazing job each week creating new worlds we could explore and have a ton of fun in. My character was an 8 foot tall Barbarian Amazon. Think Wonder Woman but a bit more of a murder hobo. My two friends playing along where a mariachi samurai that kept his swords in the necks of his double neck acoustic guitar and a cross bow wielding elf sniper that while being a rogue ark type managed to not be a ""that guy."" 

 Every adventure we had was a fast paced race against time to get to the next entrance to a magical space elevator that would let us stay one step ahead of an infinite wave of spiders we had inadvertently unleashed on our multiverse in the 1st session by turning on a metal fan we found in a cave that just sprayed an endless wave of the little guys. We went to a Godzilla world and solved a murder mystery. We fought the zombified corpses of super powered U.S presidents. We even fought Loki for control of the Space Jam talent stealing basketball which ended up being a trap that teleported us to the world that the movie Demolition Man takes place in.  It was bonkers.

 The whole time I couldn't wait for my turn dming. I was up next to dm and had so many ideas. I set my campaign in the DC universe and my players were all going to be trying out to become part of the JLA (Justice League of America) as new fledgling super heroes. My former dm now player was a super hero that could control his own momentum and how gravity affected him. Basically a human cannonball. My friend that played an elf was now basically Chel from Portal but a man complete with a portal gun. But our mariachi wasn't going to be playing with us this time around. Our former dm said he knew a guy that was interested that went to his college and we brought him on board. Enter George the problem player. 

George was a bit weird from the jump. Playing a cybernetic gargoyle with a grappling hook so he could get on top of buildings and glide like Batman. A great concept for a character but George couldn't take his turn without an issue plaguing everything past his 1st sentence. You ask him what action he would take and then it would start. He would just spew forth verbal diarrhea for sometimes as much as five minutes describing every little thing he did. I would describe a room full of thugs for them to take out and it would be: ""I fire my grappling hook into the ceiling and swing to kick the 1st guy. And then do a spinning back flip kick to land behind the second. And then I snap his arm holding his gun. And then I break his knee by kicking the back of it before rounding on the next guy, etc.""

I tried my best to stop this behavior. But at the time was very afraid of my 1st game dming ending if he decided to leave. So likely I was not at all forceful in getting my point across. Me and my closer friends all discussed ways to stop this in private and all took our turns trying to get him to stop. He would say he was going to be more considerate of the other players time but never changed. Me and the Chel player even ended up trying to show him how many times he was saying ""And then,"" one session by making a drinking game out of it but we just ended up very drunk and nothing changed. 

All the while George is getting closer with all of us outside the game. He clearly doesn't understand the nature or natural rhythm of doing improv and telling a story in a group setting but he's not that bad seemed to be the group consensus at the time. Turned out we were incredibly wrong. It's here I should mention that the Chel player is a cis man and one that had quite a bit of free time during this period as they were unemployed then. So one night they invited George over to play videogames and proceeded to get hammered together. While drunk George laments the loss of his last relationship. Chel asks what happened and George reveals that his last partner was his 14 year old cousin. George is 23. He has already told us his last break up was just 4 months ago. Chel is obviously horrified as they are an SA survivor themselves. His exact words were that she broke off the ""relationship"" and ended things because she couldn't ""handle his intellect."" The moment he can my friend immediately texts the rest of us that we have a big problem. 

After this two mistakes were made on our part. We didn't immediately kick him from the group and we didn't confront him about it. Of course now I know that no table top is better than bad table top but at the time we just didn't want the game to end. We did stop hanging with him outside sessions however. Something he noticed and complained about often. I feel terrible about it now but I decided to turn the end of my campaign into a kind of test for George. To prove he was definitively a creep. 

So during the next game I put my plan into motion. I had set up that a female gargoyle was involved in the events that were unfolding around the characters but she had always avoided directly interacting with the players. She was meant to be a helpful NPC that would show up during the end game to help stop the world ending threat to earth as well as a possible love interest for George. I changed her to be a very young woman. So that when George met her he would know that she was absolutely not mature enough to pursue. So she finally meets the party and George, knowing her age, immediately begins creeping on her. 

I realized my mistake at this point that I now had to role play him coming on to me. I had meant for this to be proof to the rest of my friends that he was in fact a massive creep and him ""hooking up"" with his cousin wasn't a one time thing. I was right but I had no idea what to do now that I had proved it. I fully panicked. Even tried to get him to stop by pointing out her age. He said something like ""I can teach her."" Disgusted and totally freaked out I wrapped up the campaign as rapidly as I could that night. Just saying whatever I could to railroad my players to the end game and get the hell out of that house. 

It ruined the ending for sure. Which I still feel absolutely terrible about. At least after that night I was done with George and thank God so was everyone else. We all completely cut contact. He tried to get back into our good graces several times clearly not understanding what he did wrong. None of us were about to spell it out for the guy. We all just ignored him until he went away.

 Fortunately this didn't sour us to DND as a group and the next game we did our original dm ran Curse of Strahd for us and we all learned how to play properly. I will always regret my decision to test him though. The ultimate lesson I learned here being: when someone tells you who they are, believe them.

Edit: Lots of people commenting the same stuff so I'll provide a bit more context just so I don't have to keep on replying to the same things. This happened 15 years ago. None of us knew his family as he was from out of state and we figured nothing would have happened if we told the cops. As we had no evidence a crime had even taken place. Just a drunken story that he could easily deny ever having said. Obviously all of this could have been handled much better than it was. Like with all things in hindsight had I known then what I know now things would have played out very differently.

We roll with it for the day, then that night one of the players checks police records and finds out that ""silly mistake"" was sexual assault/rape of a 15 year old girl.

Sadly, I do understand how they came to that conclusion: if they couldn\'t confirm George was a creep to the satisfaction of all, they were going to have to confront just how messed up not only George, but the other members of the friend group, were.\xa0\n\n\nI\'ll echo everyone else who says the cops should have been called. And I hope they told anyone else who was associated with George about what went down.

"The Peanut Gallery: February 26, 2024","Welcome to the [Peanut Gallery](https://www.nuttyspectacle.com/)! Today I’ve got nothing but good news.  

Please remember that I know nothing.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      

 

>President Biden on Monday said he hoped a deal between Israel and Hamas could emerge as soon as next week, providing for the release of many of the remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for a temporary pause in the fighting in the Palestinian enclave. 

 

>Asked on Monday when a Gaza cease-fire could start, Biden said: “I hope by the end of the weekend. ... My national security adviser tells me that we’re close — we’re close — we’re not done yet. My hope is by next Monday we’ll have a cease-fire.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      

I’ll be honest, the Israel-Hamas War? I hate everything about it. It’s my bane, utterly incomprehensible and *guaranteed* to start a fight with every conversation, so believe me when I say that I am grateful for this impending ceasefire. It’s a huge deal, one which will strengthen both Israel and Ukraine’s moral credibility, and in my opinion brings nothing but benefits.  

1. People will stop justifying Russia’s atrocities with a shrug and a, “But what about Israel-Palestine?” 

2. Guns meant for Israel can instead go to Ukraine.  

3. Red Sea drama should simmer down.  

4. Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis will distance themselves from Iran (given their cowardice). Fundie sects run on street cred, and Iran just lost a whole bunch due to their failure to intervene.  

5. Iran gets an out, one they look eager to take.  

6. Putin loses the direct material assistance Iran’s proxy network provided his war effort.  

7. All of this means the world can shift its focus back to where it belongs: Ukraine.  

Provided the ceasefire goes into effect as the President implies. Seven more days, then [Israel & Palestine can begin to discuss what comes next.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65940706-2744-442e-a199-587819099e85_1024x1024.webp) It seems clear to all parties involved that the pre-Oct. 7th status quo wasn’t working and that something needs to materially change. What that something might be requires a serious conversation, yet nobody can say anything so long as people are killing each other.

Call me irrational, but I’ve got faith this thing will go into effect. Biden wouldn’t have dropped that ‘Next Monday!’ tidbit if he wasn’t confident in the ceasefire’s prospects. The important deciders must be down to niggling over minor details.  

Honestly, though, Biden’s confidence seems at odds given Netanyahu’s apparent intransigence.  

 

>The negotiations have proved difficult as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to appease far-right members of his government, who have opposed the deal, and Hamas has made demands that Israel finds unacceptable, including on the issue of releasing Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages. 

 

Netanyahu is against any concept of a ceasefire, mainly because he knows his hold on office depends on the war continuing. Biden’s confidence makes me think Netanyahu’s opinion on the matter is irrelevant. Now I’m completely ignorant to Israeli parliamentary rules, norms, and procedures, but if I had to throw out a hairbrained guess it’s that Netanyahu’s coalition is about to dissolve. Before Oct. 7th his grip on power was tenuous, one he hoped to tighten by seizing control of the Israeli judiciary. This pissed a lot of people off, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see Israel’s parliament chuck Bibi out on his ass. The potential release of all remaining hostages would certainly give them cause.  

But until this ceasefire goes into effect, we’ve all got to deal with his bullshit, apparently.  

 

>Netanyahu has become increasingly defiant of U.S. demands and has rebuffed Biden’s specific requests, causing a rift between the two leaders. U.S. officials hope that a long-term pause will make it harder to resume fighting on the same scale and that Israel will shift to a more targeted, less deadly military operation.  

 

Yeah, that man knows he’s fucked if this ceasefire goes into effect, so he’s going to kick and scream every step of the way. He wants war, wants conflict because it feeds into his faction’s fetishism of its own self-inflicted victimhood. They chose to build settlements in the West Bank. They chose to infringe upon the sovereignty of the Palestinians. And now a thousand of their countrymen are dead.  

 

[Repression breeds retaliation. Violence spreads violence. Death begets death.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50a6490e-f4d5-4d87-b236-c48ed55e5654_1024x1024.webp)

 

The issue of Netanyahu is the same issue posed by Orban, Erdogan and Trump: how do we stop this shit from happening? How do we stop psychopaths from seizing the reins of power? People here in the States go on and on about cognitive tests—about how Trump needs one, how Biden needs one, how the whole damn government needs one.  

 

I say good to that, cognitive tests are important, but if we’re going to go so far as to make our governmental officials take a test, then we might as well squeeze the whole orange. Let’s test for psychopathy and narcissism, too. Both of those personality disorders should disqualify a person from public office.

Why Is It Doing This?!,Since when does it hide the other weapons at the end past MWII weapons?,1b15l3n,1,2,https://i.redd.it/fmsv6uu6t2lc1.jpeg,"['Since season 2', 'I’m not using MW2 guns, so I used the Filtering button there on the bottom right, so it only shows MW3 guns.']"
The Anti Materiel Rifle needs some minor tweaks to be amazing.,"The AM Rifle has two properties that make it a solid competitor for the Railgun:

1. Massive headshot modifier allowing it 1 tap all basic and medium enemies and 2 tap even Hulks so long as you get headshots.
2. Far far more ammo than the Railgun. 

In practice it is held back by two main things:

1. The bullets have a tiny tiny hitbox, so small that you might as well be shooting pin heads. This makes landing headshots on moving targets bordering on impossible. (can't wait for all the git gud idiots to comment on this one) 
2. The reticule has a square at it's centre for the aim point of the crosshair.  This square is significantly larger than the actual bullet hitbox, meaning you have no central point of aim for the level of precision the weapon demands. When aiming at a Hulk at 50+ meters it is a complete guess as to where your shot will go even on the 200m zoom setting. 

&#x200B;

[Can you even tell which one of these was a hit and which was a miss? The difference is imperceivable in terms of movements of your mouse or heaven forbid controller. ](https://preview.redd.it/i2tbszvyo2lc1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c22e85011caed51e2c6bce33008b5b801a1ea6)

How to fix the gun and make it a real competitor for the Railgun:

1. Increase the bullet hit box to better reflect the size of the projectile and make hitting headshots more manageable. **OR** seeing as the gun has no over the shoulder aim and thus no aim assist, add bullet magnetism to the shots aka Destiny 2 gunplay. 
2. Change the centre of the crosshair to a traditional cross so that precision aiming can be made at distance. 

Lots of other weapons need lots of help but the AM Rifle is only 2 quick changes away from being great. To all the git gudder commentors, there is a reason Destiny 2 and Halo have the best gunplay in the genre of shooters. It's because they understand that bullet magnetism, aim assist and decently sized hitboxes are not about making the game easy, they are about making it fun and pleasant to play.  Not to mention the game already has generous aim assist for over the shoulder mode which is why the Railgun is so fun to use.

[WTS] Nighthawk Custom DTS & Fenix PD36 TAC,"Timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/40BllI7

The title pretty much says it all: 


~~Nighthawk DTS:~~ **SOLD**

~~**•** I recently had a professional trigger job done to the gun for which I originally purchased this “DTS” Drop-in Trigger System made by Nighthawk Custom, and since it was the last of my 1911s to get such a treatment, I have no real use for this (admittedly really cool) little gizmo, so I’m offering you fine people a chance to take it off my hands for a solid discount.~~

~~**•** It’s in what I would call “pretty-good/B-B+” used condition, which is to say that it has some cosmetic wear (all of which is *very* clearly pictured), functions perfectly, and does exactly what Nighthawk claims it should—or, at least, it did in my Ruger LW Commander .45 (where it lived until recently). I *will* say: I ended up having to get a new thumb-safety cut for it to fit in the Ruger properly, but interestingly, when I tried installing it in the Colt M1991A1 (a barebones, 5” GI-style Series 80 in .45) that has been my current “project gun,” and a friend’s Fusion Freedom Reaction (also a 5” .45, but with all the contemporary bells & whistles) just for kicks, it dropped into both (using their original thumb-safeties) with 0 issues, passed all the standard function-checks, and resulted in crisp, 3.75-4.25# pulls in every gun it was installed in (though I only ever actually live-fired it in the Ruger).~~

~~**•** As far as I know/can tell, it’s from the first generation of these. I bought it new on sale from Primary Arms ±18mo ago for $280, and have put *maybe* 1200 rounds through the Ruger it’s been in since then. In the interest of full-disclosure, I don’t cross my threshold without a concealed handgun, and I *do* carry that particular gun fairly-frequently, since it’s got the shorter 4.25” barrel and alloy frame, but that doesn’t appear to have created any significant wear/done any damage whatsoever to the hammer. I keep *all* of my guns lubricated religiously, use Barricade (either spray or wipes) regularly to prevent corrosion, and my 1911s get detail-stripped + cleaned anytime they are shot.~~

~~**Pricing:** Both Primary Arms *and* Brownells have them listed at $300 right now, so that’s *actual* retail and not just MSRP, but this baby can be yours for just **$210 TYD (OBO—serious offers only, please)**; I’ve got Stamps(.)com up on one of my monitors, and a stack of Small Priority Flat-Rate boxes, plenty of packing paper, and my favorite tape gun ready to go, so if you act fast, you could have this in time to spice-up your weekend range-trip!~~ **SOLD**

~~**Fenix PD36 TAC:**~~ **SPF**

~~**•** Ever wanted to be able to shine a light across nearly 3 whole football fields, end-to-end? How about blind your enemies, impress your friends, AND provide the strobe light for an entire dance party, all with something small enough to fit in a pants-pocket? Well you’re in luck, because up for sale is a barely-used Fenix PD36 Tac flashlight! With two “modes,” 6 total brightness levels, *and* a strobe setting—all controlled with your thumb—this light puts the OP in “options!” In “Duty” mode, toggle among 30lm, 150lm, 350lm, 1000lm, and 3000lm, or turn the selector the other direction for “Tactical,” which has just one setting: 2000lm, and in either mode, holding the button down for ±3s activates the 2000lm strobe function to disorient, distract, or disco!~~

~~**•** The manufacturer rates the PD36 Tac’s maximum beam throw at 299yd/274m and maximum intensity at 18700 candela, claims it is impact resistant up to 1m and submersible with an IP-rating of IP68. Clocking in at 3.24oz and 5.35” long, this is by no means a “light” light (lol), but this chunky boi is nonetheless set up for carry, either with the *strong* belt/pocket clip, or—at just over 1” in diameter—in your favorite flashlight belt/MOLLE pouch, making it *perfect* for Law Enforcement, personal protection, or private security use.~~

~~**•** If that isn’t “tactical” enough for you, it was *also* designed to be fully-operable with gloved hands (I’ve tested this with shooting gloves and it is very much true). The battery is easily removed by unscrewing the butt-cap, and charges via USB-C (cable included), but that’s not something you should need to worry about super often, since, unlike many lights, which run out of juice in a matter of minutes at their “turbo” brightness, the PD36 Tac has a runtime of 1.5 HOURS at that 3000lm “turbo” setting, just over 3hr at 2000lm/“tactical” and 160hr—nearly an entire week—on “eco” (30lm), so you don’t have to worry about your light dying on your in the field (and can feel good about the low environmental-impact of such an efficient, rechargeable system, lol).~~

~~**•** This particular PD36 Tac is in what I would call “good” condition, having fallen from my lap onto the ground when getting out of the car one time, landing at an angle on the front end, and bouncing such that it struck near the tail end (the resulting marks are circled ⭕️ in the photos—any other spots you see are dust or skin cells, however I brushed it off pretty thoroughly and wiped it down with an alcohol pad, so it is pretty darn clean). I do not have the packaging this came in, as it was recycled by my soon-to-be-ex-wife because “it looked like trash,” (no, that wasn’t a factor in our separation, lmao), but it *does* come with the original charging cable.~~

~~**Pricing:** These guys retail for $100 on Amazon, but I’m asking only $60 shipped (OBO)~~ **SPF**

~~**If you want to take both off my hands, I’ll let the pair go as a “bundle” for $250!**~~

[PC] [2010's] A third person scifi shooter on y8 games with a similar feel to halo and themes of zero gravity and space stations,"I used to play this games a lot as a kid in computer classes, around 2012-2016, before the flash purge.  
It was on y8 games and pretty popular. I remember having it having a low poly, scifi look. It's similar to [Jamir.io](http://Jamir.io), but it's not that. You could play with different classes, two were free permanently and two were free on a weekly rotation, the rest were pay to play. Every class had two guns you could switch between, as a sub-class of sorts. If you pressed shift your charackter would slide with momentum, which was pretty fun.

The game had a wide array of game modes, capture the flag, king of the kill, control point and death match.

Most maps had a low gravity setting, in space stations mostly and you could jump super high. I particularly remember two maps: one space station loading area with an octogonal shape. There was a space shuttle in the middle, suspended midair, where the most op powerups were. Around  it, there were these really fun tunnels where you could slide around and pick up power ups, basically jousting with guns if you came across someone. The other map was a disk with two sides, both looking the same. If you fell off the edge, you'd end up on the other side because the gravity would switch. It was a vertical map with towers and multiple layers of arenas. The skybox was a picture of space.

For the title I remember something along the lines of ""gravity fall"" or ""gravity rush"", but I might be confusing it with something. I'm 80% sure gravity was in the name. It seem to have been a victim of the flash purge, but I really want to show it to my friends in college. Any help is appreciated.",1b14k29,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/1b14k29/pc_2010s_a_third_person_scifi_shooter_on_y8_games/,['Solved! It was Freefall Tournament.']
This happens far too often,"No one is going to speak up for these women, so I am going to start. I have no idea how to start by alerting the right people about how there is injustice in our system.  This started a little over a year ago. I met a man, he leeched his way into my apartment, depleted my resources and then started drinking. I don’t mean a glass of wine or 6 cans of beer. It started with 2 pints a night, it will end with 2 x 2.75 liters in a weekend. My fault is I found a guy who looked like a man who could be as amazing as my step-father, but was a boy like my evil bio-father. 

&#x200B;

When I started to notice how aggressive and demeaning he was while he drank, I tried pouring out the liquor and he shoved me into my bathtub, hitting my head on the tile wall. Lucky for me, he did get a job and moved his drinking to the weekends. He would start drinking Friday the second he got off work, barely walked in the door, and continued to drink every second he was awake. This would lead him to being so drunk that he would pass out and even attempts to jolt him awake (like you would during CPR) wouldn’t wake him. Multiple times he had drunk so hard he would piss himself and lay there for hours in it until he came to. He would get on MeetMe to scream obscenities at people, how he hated the Jews and demeaning shit about women. It was stressful. 

&#x200B;

Until Sunday evening, I would snap and try to establish boundaries which would develop into us screaming. Initially, when he would scream in my face like a drill sergeant, I was calling the police. This ended with the police lecturing us. When he started to get physical and I called the police, still the police would lecture us that we were adults and still do nothing. There was even a time he hit me in the nose, the police were called and they took so long to get out, the bleeding stopped and I was able to wipe most of the blood off, but you could still see evidence of a nose bleed, and the cops did nothing just told us to keep our hands off each other. I even called the police one night and they took over 2 hours to arrive. My BF passed out after barricading me in my room and all I could do was from my window, watch the cops come to the door, knock and then leave without doing anything. 

&#x200B;

After multiple police visits, BF learned that he could work me up and when the police arrive, he would appear calm (mind you he was still intoxicated, but a good functioning alcoholic) and I would appear hysterical. Twice in one year, this ended me in a psych ward. The first psych ward, they even assessed all of my bruises, and I will never forget the one nurse telling the other that “this happens far too often”. The second psych ward was a whole other story where I was sexually assaulted during intake by another patient, never once got to talk to a doctor, so, of course, they misdiagnosed me to what my boyfriend recommended as a diagnosis. Immediately getting out of the second psych ward, I was home for probably a few hours in so much pain that I went to another hospital and had to have emergency Gallbladder removal surgery. Needless to say, after being in the hospital so much, I ended up losing my job and my apartment, but here is when we get into the injustice of our system. 

&#x200B;

After I healed from surgery, I was no longer on pain meds and had nothing to alleviate me from the stress of the BF. We were starting to fight again, it was getting physical again, and the first time I was trying to leave and he was preventing me. The cops were called and while waiting out their long response time, I got an opportunity to get out of the house. I was trying to drive to my parents and the BF was using everything he could to call me and I was ignoring his calls. Well apparently the cops arrived after I got out and he gave them his side of the story, showing marks he received while I was trying to defend myself, not getting my side of the story or seeing my marks, so they put a warrant out for my arrest. I wasn’t given any information about this warrant. He eventually found a way to manipulate me into coming back home. This happened two more times. The second time, I did answer  BF calls and he told me he was with the cops. He gave me a story that I needed to tell the cops. I had to tell them I was off my meds and I was acting irrationally and I apologized. The cop listened, then laughed and said he was going to issue a warrant.

The last time, after he hit me with the oven (you read that right) and punched me to the ground, I remember laying on the ground and lifted my head to look out the wide open back door and saw my dog running around outside terrified, not sure where to go, too scared to come back inside. I pulled myself off the ground, grabbed her, got her in the car, and drove off. He called the cops, I got my 3rd warrant while ignoring their calls. I went to my parents and he started texting me and leaving voicemails threatening me that he was going to kill my two cats that I had to begrudgingly leave behind because they were hiding. I had to go back. 

&#x200B;

After this I learned of the warrants, I tried to meet a public defender. BF did surprisingly try to call the courts and get all the information he could to get me a public defender (most likely to make himself look like the hero in this). After he got the information it took me another 2 weeks to convince him to let me drive my car downtown to meet with the defender and BF kept coming up with excuses to not allow me to go. Finally, he allowed me to go, he escorted me to the public defender's office. When I met the defender, he wouldn’t allow BF to go back with me. The fact BF was there made the defender noticeably irritated. Defender loudly told my BF to stay in the lobby and after I explained what was going on, he nearly jumped out of his seat, he was more irritated about the situation. The two things I will forever remember about being in that office was him saying “this happens far too often” (in reference to women in my situation) and that BF being there to control the narrative was an abuse tactic. He asked if I had anywhere to go and I told him my mom and I called CHOICES and they said they cannot help anyone with a warrant out for a Domestic Violence (DV) charge. The defender said to try to hold on, we have court in a week and he was going to help me with this. Well there was one more weekend before that Wednesday court date. 

&#x200B;

The same process started again, Friday BF started drinking, and he had graduated to drinking 2.75 Liters of alcohol in a day. Saturday I tried barricading myself in my room with the animals to try to avoid him all weekend. Sunday I made the mistake of coming out of the room to go to the bathroom and get food and the fighting started again. This time I couldn’t get out with my animals. I drove around the corner to a McDonald’s parking lot and called my parents. It was a little after midnight and my stepdad got in his truck and drove 2 hours to me from another state. We went to a Waffle House and stepdad, fed up with this situation, told me what was going to happen. I was going to grab what I needed from the apartment and we were going back to his house. Little side note, stepdad is also a retired veteran and he was ranked very high. One stipulation of his job was to always have a gun on him, and he always has a gun on him. He is heavily trained and very skilled in using his gun, literally the most responsible gun owner I have ever met. I can’t stress this enough; I actually am more scared if he doesn’t have his gun on him. We get back to the apartment, I walk in and start grabbing my service dog, one of my cats (the other cat found an exceptionally good hiding place this time) and some clothes and BF starts screaming at me. Stepdad walks in and this irritates BF to the point that he calls the cops, saying he is fearing for his life and a guy at the apartment is brandishing a gun (stepdad is responsible with his gun, didn’t pull it out of the holster, didn’t show it off, BF just knows he always has a gun). I grab a few things and start getting them in the truck when a flashlight appears on me, I know it’s the cops. I stopped packing my stuff away, explained what is going on that I am trying to leave. Police ask about the gun, learn of stepdad's credentials and didn’t say another word about the gun. They ended up running my name and finding the warrants and I got arrested and went to jail that night. Being in jail is a whole other story, I did have an arraignment there. 36 hours later, my mom bailed me out, my stepdad drove 2 hours back to his house to drop off my dog and my one cat. I had to stay in town for one more day to meet my new Pretrial Officer (PO), and I am forbidden to have contact with the “defendant” or go to my house. My stepdad ended up driving back out again that morning to take me to the PO and while we were trying to drive back out of state, BF was calling and texting me demanding I transfer his cell phone off my plan and he would give me my last animal back. I transferred the service quickly and BF called my stepdad and my stepdad drove back to get the cat. I waited at a rest stop until my stepdad caught up and handed me the cat. My poor baby boy was so terrified he stayed wrapped around me the entire drive out to my parents. 

&#x200B;

I have now been here almost a month, my pretrial is on Wednesday. BF has called and text so much that it has been challenging upholding the courts demand of no contact. My unemployment checks stopped since I was in jail. I have no income in the middle of nowhere, terrified that these DV charges might stick and that will screw me out of so much I have worked hard for for years. The worst part of this is the lesson I am going to take from it: if your partner is beating you to the ground, the worst thing you can do is escape. I could die, but at least I wouldn’t have been in jail facing criminal charges.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: if your partner is beating you, and the police are coming, lay there and take it. You can either face death or a warrant for your arrest.

Recent Montana poll shows Gianforte leads Busse in race for Governor,"[Bad news for team Busse](https://www.kulr8.com/elections/recent-montana-poll-shows-gianforte-leads-busse-in-race-for-governor/article_4dee544c-939e-52f5-98b8-4fe2bd92fa55.html).

What looks to be the first independent poll of the Governor's race shows Greg Gianforte has a sizable lead against challenger Ryan Busse. The gap was 52% for Gianforte against 30% for Busse. Leaving 18% undecided.

For comparison, the same group [polled Tester vs. Sheehy](https://www.kulr8.com/elections/jon-tester-leads-in-mt-senate-poll-conducted-by-nonstop-local/article_12bb11d3-535e-5107-a358-db3936ea3ccd.html) and came out with Tester in a clear lead at 49% and Sheehy distantly behind at 40%. That left 11% undecided.

An incumbent should expect a lead this early in the election, but a 22-point difference deficit when the other top-level Democrat on the ballot has a 9-point advantage has to be scary for Team Busse. An additional comparison, Busse is polling further behind Gianforte than the worst-performing statewide Democrat (Bryce Bennett) performed in 2020.

Busse's divisive rhetoric doesn't appear to be doing him any favors. Poll results like this will make donors hesitant to send money his way, especially with Tester's race considered heavily competitive and Monica Tranel running in a friendlier district (and losing by only a few points in an off-year election in 2022).

Why send money to a lost cause when there are two other races that Montana Democrats can be favored to win? It'll be interesting to see if similar polling is done on the other statewide races.

Busse speaks well to the Democratic base, estimated to be about 30% of Montana's voting population. But his messaging isn't connecting with independents, Republicans, or third-party voters. Gianforte, on the other hand, was able to beat the Pew Research estimated 49% GOP number.

With poll numbers this low, Tester and Tranel have to start asking if Busse will drag them down.

The Dem base likes Busse, that's clear. But it's not enough in a state where the trends show Independents on their way to outnumbering Democrats. Something needs to change. Raph Graybill is a talented addition to the Busse ticket, which brings the government experience that Busse lacks. Still, Graybill was heavily shellacked by Austin Knudsen in 2020, with only one other statewide candidate losing by a more significant margin, Bryce Bennett.

One starts to wonder what the point of this matchup is. Is there a plan to win, or is the entire ticket a pander to the Dem base, knowing they're going to get their butts kicked. It's as close to a textbook example of a sacrificial lamb in politics.

I've always been skeptical of Busse as a top-tier candidate. He was a mid-level executive for one of the smaller gun manufacturers in the US. That's not leadership experience. He has a lousy record on 2A (excellent record on 2A if you're a gun control true-believer, terrible for most everyone else). Worse, he lacks self-control; he can't stop himself from getting into fights online with trolls.

We'll see in upcoming polls if Team Busse can get it together, but for now it looks like my earlier call about the Gianforte strategy to beat Busse will be true. Gianforte will ignore Busse, then treat him like comic relief, until Busse says something he can't take back because he lacks awareness. Then Gianforte's team will latch onto it, and portray Busse as an unserious candidate, with no leadership experience, and no self-control.

Busse is painting himself into a corner with his rhetoric and because he lacks the leadership skills to develop his own plan for governing, his strategy is to build up an anti-Gianforte vote like Biden did against Trump (they're not voting for Busse, they're voting against Gianforte). Well, that's not going to fly when the current governor has a 50%-plus approval rate.",1b13nn7,7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontanaPolitics/comments/1b13nn7/recent_montana_poll_shows_gianforte_leads_busse/,"['Gianforte is running Montana over a cliff along with him and his legislative minion incompetents at the wheel of the clown car.

Content Warning: >!Mentions of sexual assault!<

&#x200B;

The House stared at me for a moment, letting the tortured souls take the reins against the Curator before it morphed its form into Bea. ""Well... this is very fascinating.""

I looked down and noticed the head of the axe buried partially in the car hood where I had been lying. leaning over, I yanked it free before returning my gaze to the House. ""What's the matter? Never seen a dead man walking before?""

That's when it dawned on me. It had. As a matter of fact, that's what the creature specialized in. keeping people alive in perpetual torment, even past death.

""Or maybe you have… You've just never seen anyone escape their room, huh?""

For once, the house had no retort. No venom to spit my way. It simply stared in awe, unable to process what it was seeing.

""I'm still connected to you, aren't I? To my room?""

The creature glared at me with realization.

""Now who's feeding off of who?""

It dropped into the sea of bodies and remerged in front of the car, rising to my level. It grabbed me by the throat and lifted me into the air, an expression of pure rage across Bea's false image. I grabbed its hands and lifted myself to try and speak.

""What are you going to do? Kill me again?"" I croaked, ""Judging by your confusion, I doubt you know how to stop this from happening. Am I right? You've finally lost control of something.""

The sentence made the creature realize he had also lost his composure, and he strangled me for a moment longer before dropping me on the car hood with a thud. I gasped for air as The House began to circle around me.

""I haven't lost anything, Joel. Just because there's been a change in plans doesn't mean I can't still make you hurt.""

""Pain doesn't scare me. Especially not now.""

""You know that's not what I'm talking about. You're fully aware of what I can do to your friends.""

My confidence choked for a moment, and the house caught it. It seized the opportunity to hurt me more.

""You know, Andi was just like Ethan? Innocent in all of this, I mean. That's why she made it so far on her own. I gave her a chance to leave too, but she squandered it like Ethan. I couldn't risk her helping you all escape, so I had to tie up that loose end. 'Point is, though, her death is on you, Joel. Even more than you thought. All your innocent friends were brought here masked by your stench of guilt. Of all of your group's guilt.""

I tried not to let the words land on my conscience. If I thought too hard about Andi and Ethan being in this place just because they were in proxy when we got taken, it might break me. Instead, I leaned into the illusion of pain, letting the creature get full of itself once more. I needed it to be still and close to get a clear opening. Letting its pride build before provoking it into a burst of anger was the perfect way to do that.

""So what's the plan then? Stand here staring at one another till one of us drops dead for good? I think that might take a while.""

The House chuckled in Bea's sweet laugh, ""You confuse me, Joel. You all do. Why do you want to go home so bad? Weren't you running from all of that to begin with? I've seen your past. I know that there's nothing out there waiting for you. You made sure of that by burning every bridge you crossed.""

""You're wrong.""

""Am I? You have no friends left. No family that cares. All that's left would be what remains of your precious group, and they only stick with you through circumstance."" Unfortunately, my eyes wavered for a moment, and the house noticed. ""You know it's true, don't you? And what about Bea? Even if you two make it out of here, how long do you think you'd last? Till you can squeeze all of the excitement out of having someone new to hold before you move on to the next woman you can manipulate? How do you think she would feel about Sarah? Would you even tell her? How long did you wait after Andi left before you filled her spot with Bea, anyway? A month? Two months?""

""It wasn't like that….""

""Of course it was! You're all like that, don't you see?""

The house shifted its form, morphing into the spitting image of Daniel. It physically hurt to see him again. It hurt more to hear him speak.

""A man who put work before his own family so often that he'd let his daughter drown before he missed a phone call from them.""

He shifted again, this time into Mark, ""A tied down suburban dad who wanted excitement so bad he would break his marriage of thirteen years just to get it.""

Larry's awful image appeared with an awful sentence to accompany it, ""A Television executive that abused and mistreated his innocent little stars, then locked them into contracts that ate away their childhoods one year at a time.""

Once again, Bea appeared before me. I felt sick from seeing the faces of so many ghosts. ""A young girl who ran away from an abusive house, and not wanting to be slowed down, left her sister all alone to bear that weight by herself.""

The house changed one more time, this time into someone I could hardly stand to look at. He looked pathetic, his hair long and unkempt from nonstop travel. His frame was skeletal from a diet of nothing but preserved foods and packaged goods, but his face was the worst. Eyes that looked tired and innocent but hid so much guilt behind them.

""A boy who drove his girlfriend to kill herself,"" The house started in my own dreary voice, ""And unable to deal with the guilt, he slept with his best friend's girlfriend just so he could feel something again.""

I didn't respond. I just let myself take in the truth.

""Do you see what I mean now, Joel? You all do these horrible things for selfish motives, unaware of the lives you ruin in the process. The world is better off without you. No one will miss you. No one will wonder where you went. They'll just be happy you're gone. Deep down, you know that this place is all there is for you.""

I tried not to, but I failed to stop myself. I thought of Rose, no longer waiting for me somewhere beyond the exit. No longer able to be saved… I thought of Him and his anger toward me. His pure, justified hurt from my betrayal. 'I don't know if I can talk to you anymore.' He had told me. I thought of friends that were now long gone due to my own reclusiveness and the family who never cared in the first place. The House was right. I had nothing to return to from my life before. It was just a cold, lonely world of my own making; the cumulation of poor decisions and unchecked emotions. This place wasn't just a horrible fate I had lucked into; I was forgetting that this is where I belonged. The house hadn't picked fifteen people at random; most of us had done horrible things, and I was part of that role call. Even if I escaped, even if I made it back to my world, What could I do? Where could I go?

Two thoughts stopped my self-loathing in its tracks. The first was that I wasn't doing this for myself. I had other lives that depended on me. People I loved. People who, despite all of my filth, learned to love me …

The other reason was more selfish.

""You're still wrong,"" I said plainly. Confidently.

The house seemed taken back by the response. ""Oh?""

""In all the time you've tormented me, all of the days you showed up to mock me, the one thing you always said was that I was running. And you were right. I was. I was terrified that if I ever looked back, I would have to face whatever might be chasing behind me.""

""So you admit I'm right-""

""No, but you aren't. I may not have anyone to go home to. I may have burned every bridge on my path to this place, but you're wrong if you think I have nothing to get back to beyond that door."" I said, pointing to the glowing green light far in the distance. ""There's a future. One where I can be better. One where I can choose to kill the me that deserves to be here. I've spent too long wallowing in my own pity and mistakes already, and if I stay here, that's all I'll ever do. That's running. That's what really kept me trapped all these years."" I stood up straight and glared down the beast before me, ""So now, I'm leaving. Dead or alive. And as it seems I can't die, it looks like I really only have one other option.""

The House stared at me, angrily analyzing my face, unable to process the human emotions I elicited with its Eldritch mind. I could tell that it was trying to intimidate me, but I no longer felt any fear. All that was left was anger for something that should have died long ago.

""This is your last chance to go peacefully, Joel.""

""And this is your last chance too,"" I said sharply as I slid my hand casually behind my back. The pointed words were the exact ones I needed to elicit the burst of anger I was looking for.

In a blur, the house rushed forward and grabbed me again, but this time, I was ready. I glanced to the side, axe head in hand, and brought it hard against the creature. No luck, but that was to be expected. I may have felt confident for a fleeting moment, but there was no way I would be able to let go of years of regret so easily. That was okay, though. Right now, I just needed to convince the house that was my only plan.

The creature, angry I had even tried to harm it, twisted around and slammed into me, knocking me onto the car roof again. Slowly, it slid me toward the edge with a grin, ready to dump me into the writhing mass below.

""I may not be able to kill you, Joel, but I can certainly teach you a lesson with pain.""

Behind, I could hear the Curator screaming as its bones snapped. It had finally succumbed to their advances. I had to hurry.

""L-Let me go…."" I cried in frustration and fear, hoping it would buy the act. I focused hard on the things that terrified me most in case he was reading my thoughts. It seemed to work as he flashed a cocky grin and then spoke.

""No, Joel. I told you, this is where you belong."" The house snickered as it held me suspended over the tortured souls, ""Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to hurt you in ways unimaginable over and over until you're nothing but a broken shell of the pathetic creature you now are. Then I'm going to toss you back into your room where you can watch as member after member of your group stumbles blindly into their rooms. I'll drag you out *only* so you can see them slowly suffer and waste away. That way, you can be reminded for the rest of your miserable existence that-- you. Failed. Joel. All you did was lead your friends down here to die.""

My torso crested the edge of the car, but I grabbed onto its arm tightly, ""None of that is going to happen.""

The house laughed, genuinely bewildered that I was still fighting, ""Why not, Joel?""

""Because your pride makes you rash,"" I told the House, ""And because I still have Bea's gun.""

The creature barely had a moment to register the sentence before I buried the pistol's muzzle into its chest and pulled the trigger. The thundering gunshot rang out over the wailing souls as the bullet tore through its heart. Black ichor spilled down onto me as the House screamed so loud that my ears popped into silence for a moment. However, that was the least of my worries as the hole in his chest contracted from pain. The hole that my hand was still in.

I dropped off the edge of the car, slamming down hard against the asphalt. The figures that writhed in the darkness were still present, but they no longer reached for me or tried to crush me into the concrete. Their wails slowly dissipated as they receded into the ground, and I rolled over to sit up. My left hand came into view as I pushed myself away from the concrete, and a bloody, severed stump came in from the right to assist.

Shock froze me stiff as I stared at the spot where my hand had once been. Warm crimson poured from the mess like a fountain, and unlike when I had been in my room, the flow of blood felt dizzying.

Somehow the loss of only a single part of me was more dread-inducing than the loss of my life. I swallowed hard, urging myself not to vomit, and tried to ignore the warm, throbbing sensation at the end of the stump. Instead of screaming, I let panic take its course as I hastily fumbled to tear off my belt. Propping it against my leg, I lay my arm across it and then looped the buckle, pulling it as tight as possible. I breathed heavy and whimpered softly as the blood flow slowed and a burning pain began to set in. It was still dripping like a leaky faucet, but with luck, the tourniquet would give me enough time to grab Bea and get back to others. After that, I didn't care. Maybe if I died fast enough, I could see Ethan again before he left…

I shakily stood, trying to avoid looking at my latest injury, and walked around the side of the car. There on the ground, the House lay twitching and shaking, its black fluids mixing with the flow of my scarlet on the asphalt. It stared up at me as I approached.

""Y-You… How did you….""

Back on the catwalk before Bea had been taken, she had drawn the gun as I rushed forward with the flashlight. After seeing it smash uselessly against the creature's skull, she must have thought it wasn't worth wasting a bullet because she never fired a round. When she was impaled, she dropped the weapon to the catwalk before she fell, leaving it for me to find after the dust had settled. The house clearly hadn't noticed, however, and to keep it that way, I needed to keep the thought of it out of my head until I got the chance to use it.

I knelt down next to the house and stared at it. It was strange to see it so vulnerable. So scared. ""How does it feel?"" I asked, ""To be afraid? To be tormented? To be helpless?""

The house looked like it was still trying to process what it was feeling, and using the last of its energy, it changed one last time back into Him. ""He won't forgive you, you know. After what you did, nobody would.""

""I know,"" I muttered softly as I stood again and began shuffling back toward the theater doors. At that, the body of the house stopped moving and melted into a pile of mold.

Moving toward the doors, I looked down at the wound again. I needed to hurry. I held my spurting arm at an angle to try and allow gravity to help, then tried not to pass out. The only reason I was so calm now was because the shock still hadn't worn off.

More focused on not thinking about my missing hand, I jumped as a colossal, mangled paw stretched in front of me. It weakly grabbed me around my waist and pulled me toward its body.

""Joel…"" It gasped, barely audible. I stood caressed next to the tangled body of the Curator, its skin barely attached and limbs broken beyond repair. Its eyes looked at me with joy and excitement as they usually did, but they also looked pained and afraid. Of everything troubling my mind at that moment, I still found room to feel pity for the creature. It was genuinely sad to see such a mighty beast so weak. It was clear that it wouldn't last much longer; however, it still held me tight.

Swallowing some blood that had pooled in my mouth, I spoke, ""Hey, friend."" I looked down to its arm where the skin had torn away to find nothing but bone and strange, leathery tendons that held the sockets together. They leaked the same black liquid the house was. Slowly, I lay a hand on a clean spot.

""You did very well,"" I told it gently. ""You saved me. You saved all of your pets."" The fear in its piercing orbs wavered as it listened to me speak, and I felt its body begin to ease its tension. ""You kept us fed, and you protected us from all those mean monsters…"" My voice trailed off as I looked at the beast that had been with us all these years. The only reason I was still alive.

""Thank you. You were an excellent guardian.""

Painfully, it dragged its opposite hand across the concrete to its throat and, raising its fingers, gently tapped.

*Tink, TINK!*

It stared for a moment longer before its grip fully loosened, and the Curator's head slouched against the floor. For whatever reason, I found that I had to wipe my eyes as I climbed over its arm and made my way toward the theater once again.

Shuffling down the hall and squeezing my strapped arm, I headed for Bea's room. I peered into the black void and called out, no longer afraid of alerting any presences. There was no response, but Bea's form was still a dot on the horizon. I looked down at the blood flow, ensuring I still had some to lose before entering in. I stepped across the nothingness until my trail of blood swirled into her own before crouching down next to her. I hoped she would be able to walk, as carrying her wasn't an option anymore.

""Bea?"" I said, shaking her with my good hand. ""Bea, are you okay?"" With the house dead, it was safe to assume that we would no longer be able to survive our wounds, and Bea's was pretty severe.

""Joel? Is that you?"" she asked, her head actually turning to face me this time. Her eyes were so full of desperation and joy to see me. They looked just like--

They... They looked like Bea's. And that was the only thing I ever wanted to see them as. Beautiful and perfect. Her own.

She looked around the area, and my heart sank as she spoke again.

""Where's Ethan?""

As I looked at her, I knew I should lie. I knew we didn't have much time, and telling her about Ethan would only slow us down. Still, I couldn't. It wasn't fair to her or Ethan.

""He, um… He didn't make it, Bea."" I struggled out.

She said nothing and slowly looked away as tears filled her eyes. I squeezed her hand tightly as I did the same. After a long moment, she turned back to me.

""Are you okay?"" She asked, trying to bury her emotions. Now that the House was dead, it seemed its grip on her had loosened, and she seemed more coherent. Still, her room clearly took a toll, as she looked absent and vacant…

""Yeah, I'm fine. C'mon, Bea, we need to move. You're hurt; can you walk?""

""Joel, I'm sorry, I can't leave."" She muttered, looking away toward the dark endless abyss.

""No, you can now. The house is dead-- you're not trapped anymore.""

She thought for a moment but ultimately shook her head, ""It doesn't matter either way. This is where I belong, Joel.""

""No, it's not, Bea. You belong with us, and you deserve to get out of here."" I said, doing my best to slide a hand beneath her and help her up. This only resulted in her wincing in pain from the hole in her stomach. ""Bea, come on! Work with me here!""

""Do you remember how I told you about my sister?"" She started in a low mutter, ""When Andi first left, I was so upset. I was so angry that she would do that to us. It seemed so selfish that with all the pain she knew we were in, she would add more to that by abandoning us. But then I remembered that that was exactly what I did to my sister, Joel… My stepdad, he- I knew what he was capable of, and still when the chance came to run, I-"" Her voice broke with a sob as she struggled to continue. ""I ran, Joel. I left her all alone to fend for herself. Since he had always liked her a bit more, I thought she would be okay. That's how I justified it to myself. But a lot of time passed, and I went back for her, and she was hardly the same person. She was quiet and had no joy anymore. She was like an empty husk, and I couldn't bear it. He took it from her, Joel. I left, and he took her joy. I left, and he ra-""

She broke again, unable to speak the word. I didn't blame her. It was a disgusting, vile word that didn't deserve to be spoken about anyone.

""This is where I belong, Joel."" She continued in tears. ""Alone and hurt, just like I left her.""

I stared at her, and my heart broke at how much pain she was in, physically and mentally. I wanted to take her away from it; far, far away. But I knew I couldn't. Only she could do that herself. All I could do was offer her words.

""Bea… I can't even begin to imagine what you or your sister went through. I am so sorry that those things happened to you… No child should ever have to deal with that. But Bea, those things that he did to you and your sister; None of that is your fault. None of it."" I guided her cheek to look at me, ""None of it. That is all on him. You are not responsible for the evil things he chose to do, and if anything, he's the one who should be rotting in this place. Not you. So please, don't do this to yourself, Bea.""

She looked at me and slowly raised her arm to grab my hand but shook her head, ""You should go, Joel. You don't belong here.""

""Bea-""

""Just leave me. Even if I make it out, what do I have on the other side?""

I looked to the open door in the darkness, then at my gushing arm. The house was dead, and so was the Curator. If I didn't come back and the rest of the group decided to leave, they would have no trouble getting out. They didn't need my help anymore...

""Okay,"" I told her as I lay down in the blood next to her.

""What are you doing?""

""If you're staying, then I'm staying too.""

""What?""

""I have nothing else past that door either, Bea. At least not yet. There's more to see beyond what we've already experienced, But I don't want to see it unless you're there beside me. If you aren't coming, then I'm staying.""

""Joel…""

""Bea.""

She analyzed my face with almost no discernable expression before forcing herself up, grunting and coughing as she tried to sit. I immediately scurried to my feet and helped her with my good hand, and she stared at me.

""Okay..."" She mustered from within. A sweeter word had never been spoken.

The two of us began to hobble our way toward Bea's door, and thankfully, she passed right through it with no trouble. She held her coat pressed to the hole in her stomach and leaned on me hard as the pain crippled her with every step. I, too, was beginning to stumble and trip over my feet as blood loss continued to overtake me. The elevator wasn't far now. Just a little bit more…

I kept my arm tucked to my side as we moved, not wanting Bea to notice. Luckily her attention was occupied already as we passed the body of the Curator and the House in the parking lot. I gave her arm a gentle tug as she focused in on the white sheet covering a body. We made our way across the garage to the glowing light above the elevator doors where I pressed the button on the wall to call the lift. My head spun as a pool of blood formed on the floor beneath me, and Bea looked sick and pale as she leaned against the wall and breathed heavily.

*Ding!*

The elevator slid open, and we shuffled inside, Bea slumping slowly to the floor as I went for the keypad.

""Hang on. Just a bit more, okay?""

""Yeah… Alright."" She muttered with a swallow.

As I looked between the two of us, I realized that there was no chance we would make it back to the surface. Not in the conditions we were in. Alice had told me that the elevator only went to the floor below the basement of the saferooms. That meant we had a massive staircase we would need to climb on top of more rooms and another staircase to get to the yellow room. We could barely stand right now. That's when I had a thought, though. She said that was floor one. But what about…

I typed zero and pressed enter. The elevator doors slid shut, and it began to ascend with a rattle. I sighed with relief and made my way to the wall, where I slid down next to Bea. That's when she finally saw it.

""Oh my God, Joel, your arm."" She cried with as much energy as her body would allow.

""It's okay. It'll be okay.""

""Your hand it's-""

""Yeah, I know. Don't worry about it. I'm trying not to.""

She swallowed hard and then looked at me before laying her head on my shoulder and lacing her fingers into my present hand.

""So you found the exit?""

""Yeah.""

""And you… killed the House?""

""It's a long story.""

She didn't say anything else, as I could tell the specifics didn't matter to her. All that mattered was that it was over. I felt her body relax more, and I gave her a nudge.

""Bea?""

""…Yeah?""

""Don't give out on me. We're so close.""

I felt her nod before she lifted her head and looked at me.

""Hey, Joel?""

""Yeah?"" I said, turning to her.

""In case I don't ever get the chance….""

""For what?""

She leaned forward and pressed her lips against my own.

The scene wasn't romantic by any definition. We were two kids sitting on the floor, creating red pools beneath us. I didn't have a hand free to hold her with, and she didn't have the strength to lean into the kiss. On top of that, the taste of blood hung on both of our dry, cracked mouths. Even still, it was the most honest affection I had ever taken part in.

I stared at her as she pulled away, and after a moment, I laughed softly, ""I really hope we get more chances.""

She chuckled as well, ""Me too.""

*Ding!*

The doors opened, and I stood, nearly collapsing as I helped Bea up. I shuffled into the room we had arrived at to find that it was only a tiny little strip, almost like a laundry room. We began to move through when Bea stumbled and began coughing violently. I stopped and slowly helped her to sit again.

""It's okay; just hang on, Bea,"" I told her, a little more panicked. ""Just wait right here.""

I turned to the end of the room where the only door sat. A metal door with a lever handle. The same door I had looked at for years, now from another side. I approached it and looked at the grip, where nothing but a tiny lock held it in place. I flicked off it with a smirk of irony. We had been only a few feet from a way out this whole time, and all that was stopping us was a piece of metal the size of a button. Before opening it, I raised my knuckles to the door.

*Knock, Knock, Knock… Knock!*

I heard bodies and voices begin to draw near, and I smiled again, this time out of joy. I slowly opened the door and peered inside. There everyone stood, looking from the bedroom doorway with fear. Their expressions changed, however, when they saw it was me. Grace placed her hands to her mouth, and Ben's eyes opened wide. Jan was holding her beautiful baby in her arms, but her eyes went watery when they met my own. Frank and Clair were in the very back trying to peer through, and behind them all, Alice looked at me with a smile.

There were so many things that I wanted to say to them at that moment. How happy I was to see them. How much I had missed them. That I loved them all, and I was so sorry that I never told them that enough. But I was so tired, dizzy, and relieved to see them again, that all that came out was...

""Hey, guys… I'm back.""

""Joel!"" Grace called as they all rushed forward toward me. They stopped abruptly when I swung the door open and they saw my condition, however.

""Oh my-!""

""It's okay…."" I slurred. ""I know, I'm bleeding, but it'll be okay. W-we need to go, though. I found the exit.""

""Claire, quick grab some rags; the alcohol too. We need to apply pressure. He's already lost a lot, it looks like.""

""Joel, sit down! It's going to be okay!""

""Don't close your eyes, alright? Just keep them open.""

""Ben, round up whatever we might need, and let's get ready to go. Alice, you said there's an elevator?""

People screamed commands at one another like a staff of panicked doctors, but my head blurred their voices all into one. I couldn't help but think of Andi. I now knew what she felt. I was no longer immune to injury, and this time I would die for good. However, that thought wasn't disheartening. I got to see everyone again. I got to know they were all safe and that I had done what I had set out to do. They all looked so scared and panicked, but I couldn't help but smile. I loved them all so much. Still, it felt like something was missing.

""Oh goodness, grab more rags! Bea is in here too, and she's also hurt!""

""Are Ethan and Daniel there as well?""

""N-No... Just Bea. Hang on, sweetheart, it's going to be Okay. God, it's so good to see you.""

That was it. Daniel was still down there somewhere. As Ben drew near with the gauze and alcohol, I grabbed his arm

""E-Ethan… didn't make… He…"" It was all incoherent, but he understood what I was saying. He solemnly looked to the rags as he medicated them thoroughly but then smiled, trying not to make things worse.

""That's okay, Joel. You all did so well. Now bite down on this. It's going to hurt, okay?""

""Daniel… He's… He's-"" Before my pounding head could force out the rest of the sentence, Claire placed a rag into my mouth.

""Alright, here we go. Hang on, Joel.""

I tried to call out through the gag, but they touched the cloth to the end of my limb before I could, and blinding, searing pain forced me into numbness. It felt like I was melting as acid crept into arteries and tissue, and it took all of my energy not to pass out. I thought I even heard a tooth crack as I bit into the rag so hard I couldn't breathe.

As the pain resided, I found myself in the elevator being carried by Frank. My stump lay across my chest with rags still stuck to the end. Everyone else was packed inside, carrying a few meager belongings that meant something to them throughout our time here. Across from me, I saw Bea in Jan's arms, her eyes closed and breathing shallow. With a shake from Jan, she opened them again.

""Just a bit more, Bea. Almost there."" She cooed

Next to me, I heard a slight cry and turned to see the innocent eyes of a baby staring back at me. Cozy in Grace's embrace, they looked at me with pure curiosity. Slowly and shakily, I reached my good arm out and offered a finger, which they happily latched onto.

Jan smiled with tear-filled eyes, ""Joel, this is the newest member of our family. Her name is Andi.""

I smiled as warmth filled my chest, ""Andi… T-That's a good name.""

The doors opened, and everyone filed out, Alice taking the lead.

""This way. We're almost there.""

""W-Wait!"" I said, squirming in Frank's grasp. ""D-Dan, he's still trapped… I- I need to go save him.""

Everyone nervously exchanged glances as they looked between Bea and me.

""They've lost a lot of blood."" Ben said, ""I don't know if they'll hold out much longer.""

""Where is he, Joel?""

""I-I don't-""

""I think I know,"" Alice said. ""I'll go check for him. You all head that way till you see the green exit sign. That's the way out.""

Before I could object, a couple of people nodded, and we began to move again. As I passed Alice, I looked at her.

""Y-You better m-make it back, okay?"" I told her.

She nodded with a smile and then took off back toward the elevator.

As we moved through the garage at a light sprint, my eyes were on Bea the whole time, making sure hers were still open. She was looking a lot worse than I was feeling.

""Oh my gosh…."" I heard Claire gasp as we approached the bodies of the House and Curator. Everyone cautiously slowed.

""D-Don't worry. They're d-dead.""

""Did you do this, Joel?""

""S-Sort of.""

""Damn, kid,"" Frank whispered.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the beacon of green loomed above us. As we stood before the door, the group shuffled around.

""Bea first. We'll be right behind you."" I heard Ben say.

As they swung it open and light danced across us, I could tell they all felt it. Warmth. Safety. Freedom.

Claire, Grace, and little Andi all stepped through the door with Jan, who threw one last concerned smile at me before passing through the opening with Bea in her arms. There was no grand sound as they stepped through, no fanfare or feeling of success. After all, it was just an exit, but that was all we needed it to be.

Ben stepped forward and held the door open for frank and me, then spoke. ""You two go. I'm going to wait for that Alice girl in case she can't find Dan.""

""Are you sure?"" Frank asked him.

He nodded, ""Get Joel to safety first thing, wherever you come out.""

Frank began to walk through the doorway, and the light fully engulfed us both. The sheer relief it had brought just from its radiance was nothing compared to standing inside it. Frank continued to walk as the light faded into somewhere else, but I held on to it. I know they say not to go into the light when you're dying, but at that moment, I couldn't have been happier to embrace it.

As I drifted into unconsciousness, a heavy realization finally dawned on me, one that I hadn't let myself accept until I was certain we were walking through that door: It was finally over.

For four and a half years we had lived among decrepit walls and moldy carpets, surviving on food long expired and the company of people once strangers.

An Idk what to do anymore and need advice.\]

Post; I hope this is the right subreddit. I need to kinda set the basics before typing the story. I (19M) dated my Ex (18F) for around a Month in 2023. I'll refer to her as B to keep things anonymous. B had a very rough childhood, that is, if you can even consider it a childhood. She was abused by her Father who abandoned their mother in a time of need and cheated. And later her mother began traveling across the country every couple of weeks with different men, leaving her and her sister alone for weeks at a time.

Last April, I was part of a group that went to sing in a large city. While there, one of my classmates, whom I had grown close with, and I confessed that we had mutual feelings/crushes on each other. Later that week, she asked me after a fancy and formal dinner if I wanted to be her BF. I hadn't given a relationship much thought at the time she asked, but I wasn't opposed to the idea. Since 2020 when COVID-19 hit, I had been in a dark pit with my mental health and had struggled to keep going and find purpose in life. This was due in part to the fact that I watched as all of my limited friend group find someone who they connected with, while I was still left by myself. 

Back to my situation. Before I accepted B's suggestion to be a couple, I wanted to lay some expectations. I come from a very Christian family, and I do hold those values dear to me. I'm really only interested in someone who shares my values and beliefs. I told B, that I was not interested in pre-marital sex and wanted Communication and Honesty to be of utmost importance, as I had seen many relationships crumble due to lack of communication or Honesty. To which she immediately agreed and said she recently became Christian too and that she had no problem with abstaining until marriage. At that point, I agreed and we were ""officially"" a couple. After our performance the following night, we attended a ceremony for those who performed. B and I enjoyed some wonderful food that was prepared, and after we finished, we headed back to the Hotel we were staying at. B's roommates were still at the dinner when we got back to her Hotel room (we were with a large group that was split up into rooms by Gender), so we sat and chatted for a while, kinda geeking out over getting to be part of a high-class performance the night after becoming a couple. After a few minutes of sitting beside each other on the edge of the bed, we made out. looking back on that event and evening, that was the first in a series of mistakes I made. I am not blameless in the situation and am willing to admit as much. After returning to my Hometown, we continued to hang out on an almost daily basis, which wasn't too difficult to do since we both attended the same college and had the same Major. I would ask her if she wanted anything for lunch or dinner and if so what she would like. I always got the ""I'm not hungry."", ""It doesn't matter to me."", or ""you pick."" line. Now, I should also mention that neither one of us is good at picking up social cues due to being slightly Autistic, which I was aware of before we became official. There were many times when I would try to sit close to her and show her some kind of Physical affection like Hugging, or a forehead kiss, etc. to which she would reject it, saying that she was overstimulated, didn't think it was a good time or place, or was too tired. When she would say this, I was hurt, cause all I wanted to do was provide an embrace for her (a safe space if you will).  

While we were dating, we spent many late nights with each other. we would make out and chat about what we wanted to do, whether it be the next day or far out in the future. Eventually, after my parents confronted me about being out so late regularly, I told them would make out and chat. They warned me to be extremely careful not to compromise my morals, as I was on a very slippery slope. At first, I didn't heed their warnings and we kept going out as often as we could. But I did take the initiative to say to her directly that if there was anything that I said, did, or otherwise that she wasn't comfortable with, to let me know as I was and still am terrible at reading Social cues and Body language; And the Absolute last thing I wanted to do was hurt her in any way or make her uncomfortable or controlled, to which she acknowledged and stated that She did not see me as controlling. After a few weeks of dating, we were still hanging out on a semi-regular basis, but then we both let things go further than we should have and wound up touching each other in a rather intimate fashion. Keep in mind, Clothes never came off, we both stayed clothed around each other. The most I ever saw of her was when she wore a bathing suit one day we went swimming. After getting home and reflecting on the evening, I realized that things were moving too fast and that we needed to slow down. I feel I should also mention that when we were on one of our ""outings"" which consisted of walking or hiking, we would trade seggsual jokes with each other; and when we were alone and sitting near each other I would usually have my arm around her shoulders, and she would grab my hand and move it towards her breasts. At first, I wasn't entirely comfortable with that advance and pulled back; but after some time, I just let her move my hand. But after I reflected, and came to the realization that things were going far too fast for either one of us, I didn't try to touch her in that way again. Despite this realization and my trying to restrain myself from premature advances, It was still difficult. To this point, B was the first relationship I had, and not to mention I was/am still a crazy hormonal teenage male (Biology sucks). does that excuse everything? No, absolutely not! Does it still affect decision-making? heck yeah! (sorry, that's just a fact. bite me). 

I decided one weekend to invite B to ride with me that way we could just chat. We rode for close to three hours and talked about many things, from what our future plans were together, to how things were going, things we noticed about each other, etc. One point that I brought up, is that we both had insecurities that would sometimes affect our behavior. I didn't specifically name what we would both do at the time because I didn't view it as pertinent to the Conversation. But now I don't really care so here it goes. I'll start with my Insecurities; I was very clingy, which is part of the reason we spent so much time together. I would say this came from never having many friends growing up and always being the social outcast, so whenever anyone would befriend me I would hang on to them as hard as I proverbially could, which in turn drove many people away. Then B would constantly ask if ""I was going to leave her"" or would say ""omg you're sick of me"" if I didn't respond in a very short period, even if I was busy with something. She would also make small comments like, how she broke me, or she didn't deserve me, and similar comments. She would also brush me off when I was worried about her Physical well-being as she had a habit of not eating or sleeping for long periods, as well as getting injured from walking on different surfaces like rusty metal, jagged rocks, etc. 

But just a week after that car ride, B called me in the middle of the night to say she wanted to break up. Naturally, I was devastated; this was someone who I adored more than almost anyone or anything else. And I just got a phone call in the middle of the night saying it's not working out. There was no explanation even though I asked if I had done something. I asked to speak to her the next day to try and find out what happened and why it wouldn't work, just to get blown off with still no explanation. Eventually, I just accepted it and expressed my hope that we could still be friends despite all that happened. This too was blown off. Just a week later she then texted me to say that she didn't want to remain in contact anymore and that we should ""go our separate ways"". I again, was devastated, but accepted if it was what she wanted and what would make her happy. And no more than I had sent that text, and I logged on to Facebook to remove her per her wishes, she had already done it, on every single platform and social media. She had removed me and or blocked me on all of them. 

Fast forward about a Month, and I get a notification from a mutual friend; Apparently, once B broke up with me, and cut me off, she started going around to all of our classmates and peers and mutual friends saying that I tried to rope her, which couldn't be further from the truth. The message included a screenshot of a conversation with several peers that I considered friends, in which one person in particular whom I considered a very good friend. They had sent a message to a group of most of my peers that I attended school with. In that message, they called me a ropist, and a sxual predator among other things and even went as far as to make threats against me and tried coming up with plans to get me kicked out of College. Deep down I knew they didn't have anything against me as there was nothing but B's word along with her little entourage. I messaged a couple of other people who were in the group chat that I considered close, and after getting either ignored or blown off by them as well, I decided right then and there that I was going to disappear from Social Media. And I did, I deactivated my FB and Instagram accounts after going through my friend lists and removing all but around 7 close family and friends and then deleted Snap-Chat. I was extremely hesitant about going back to college for fear that people would attack me without even hearing me out. Oh, yeah. guess who else was going to the same college.. B. As soon as I saw her I tried asking her what. happened and why she made the allegations she did. She told me she didn't want to talk about it, and throughout most of the semester, she didn't even acknowledge me. Halfway through the semester, we got a concert opportunity for a few students, and B was coming along with most of the people in the little entourage who threatened me. while at the concert, I wound up speaking to the person who started the group chat calling me a predator and other things. At first, I gave him a cold shoulder as I was still very angry and bitter about everything, but later I decided to talk to him to give myself closure. He expressed his remorse for his actions and comments and explained that after he said all that, a lot of our mutual acquaintances called him out for jumping the gun. He said that once he found out B lied and made up the allegations, he cut her off everywhere then pulled a similar move to mine, and disappeared off social Media. A few weeks after the Concert, B approached me and started talking about how her trauma made her cut me off and not confront me among other ridiculous points. I'll probably get some hate for this but I don't really care anymore. I understand that Trauma is a very terrible thing and can cause deeply rooted issues in the Future. But it's also immature and irresponsible to hide behind Trauma as a scapegoat anytime you make poor decisions. Not to mention, because of the lies she told and the threats against me, I don't trust anyone anymore. I have two friends who helped me through everything along with my parents, but I'm not trusting anyone else any time soon, cause I'll be damned if I'm going to let someone try and screw over my life again. After B came and ""explained"" herself to me, I said very little aside from, ""ok. thanks."" and went about my duties, as I had picked up many different duties around our college to keep myself busy that way my mental health didn't suffer as bad. Later on, I typed out a letter and explained that ""while I understand that Trauma is a Terrible thing to deal with, It doesn't excuse the lies you told. I know I made mistakes, and I'm more than willing to admit as much. But, what I will **NEVER** do is take all the blame, because you have your faults too. You lied and tried to ruin my life, and shattered my heart and trust. I am more than willing to be Civil, but I do not see us being friends anytime soon."" I handed the letter to her and she walked off to read it. Later she came back in and nodded, acknowledging that she read it. Then from there, it was right back to the silent treatment, which I did kind of ask for. But over this whole ordeal, I've gone from sadness and depression to anger and hatred, to indifference. I'll admit that I'm still caught between Anger and Indifference, which is part of why I wrote this post. My friends are saying that this wound will take time to heal, while my parents are saying that I need to just get over it and move on.

I'm really stuck right now and am unsure what to do or how to do it. I want to be able to move on, but I'm not sure how to do that. Plus, I still want an explanation as to why she made up and spread such a terrible lie, and I feel that I am owed at least that much. If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this kind of stuff I'd greatly appreciate it, cause I just don't know anymore.

While I understand the strong dislike towards President Trump, it is important to remember that America plays a crucial role in defending other countries from terrorism.

I am starting to hate Tom,"God, where do I begin? 

Tom is ridiculous. I’m on episode 5 of season 8 and already want to know when him and Jane break up. It’s honestly so stupid that he went out and found someone else during their separation. 

I think their marriage really does need some work, in both defenses. Tom is childish, Lynette is a control freak. Tom thinks he’s entitled, Lynette thinks she is the all mighty. 

She won’t let him express himself as a person, he doesn’t appreciate the crap she does and falls behind a shield.

What made me mad too is just how obvious Tom was ready to move on from their marriage. He’s full of himself and that’s what irked me the most. Honestly, I hope Lynette finds someone and pray that they sleep together. She’s stuck through the hardest times, while Tom pranced around like a complete child. 

She survived cancer, a gun shot, a miscarriage—everything! God, I just hope she moves onto better and Tom realizes just how much HE fucked up for a stupid fling. 

Anyways, can someone just spoil it for me and tell me if Tom breaks up with Jane? Or just tell me if Lynette gets her lick back at least 😩",1b12is3,8,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesperateHousewives/comments/1b12is3/i_am_starting_to_hate_tom/,"['Wait.

I really hate to spoil this for you, but it looks like other people already have anyway and plus you asked us to so...lol.\n\n\nIt was so gross that Tom started dating someone else like pretty much right after moving out of the house, while they were still in marriage counseling. What the hell is the point of marriage counseling when one person already has one foot out the door?\n\n\nAnd I hate that they did it this way. After everything Lynette has been through, it really should have been the other way around. Tom should have started dating someone else, Lynette should have been like ""okay well screw you then,"" started dating herself, and found a really good guy who treated her well. And he would bring out the best version of her, as since she was no longer with a partner who acts like a spoiled child, she no longer had to be a control freak. She then at this point realizes that breaking it off with Tom was the best thing she ever did. But Tom sees her happy with this other guy, happier than she had ever been with him, and realizes how badly he screwed up. Then the rest of the season should have been him pining over her and doing everything he could to become a better man so that maybe, he might just end up deserving to win her back.\n\n\nIMO, that\'s how it should have gone. But apparently, the writers did not agree.', 'Just started season 8 too. Tom used to only pissed me off, but I love him and Lynette\'s relationship. Despite the hardship, they always pull it off.

She completely lost out on her own dreams and the life she wanted. Before she met Tom, all she cared about was her career and climbing up the corporate ladder. She would never have considered being a stay-at-home mom, possibly not even a mom at all. She had to settle in a massive way - because TOM wanted kids, she agreed to one and somehow wound up a stay-at-home mom of 5. Even though she had been better at her job than Tom had been at his, it was never a consideration for Tom to be the one to stay home until Lynette pissed him off and he told her to go back to work out of spite.\n\n\nThen, Tom suddenly comes up with his dream to open up a pizza place, and Lynette is so supportive that she quits her job to help him with it. 5 years later, when the business is struggling, he up and decides to sell the place and take the family around in an RV for a year - and he made the decision without even consulting with Lynette first! As if what he says goes, he's the singular head of the family and his wife doesn't even get a say. 🤮 the ridiculous idea of the RV never happened, but just the fact that he even made that deal with someone before even talking to Lynette is disgusting.\n\n\nThen, when she finds a job she's interested in, he sabotages her interview because he's trying to compete with her, even though he doesn't really want the job himself. He went so far as to tell the employer that she's a risk because her cancer might flare up again, which is just absolutely beyond the pale. Then, because he insists on having sex everyday for a month because of some bullshit thing he read, she ends up pregnant in her late 40s and having to quit her job again. Then Tom just swoops in and steals the job from under her.\n\n\nI might have lost what I was trying to say it in all the ranting about tom lol. But my main point is that Lynette had to be a control freak because it was the only way she ever got any little things she wanted in that marriage. She already lost out on all of her big dreams in life because Tom took them away, so she probably felt like she had to be uber controlling in order to have ANYTHING at all."", 'He didn’t “go out” and find a new partner.

Downwell+ (iOS),"**Developer:** Ojiro Fumoto

**Publisher:** Devolver

**Release Date:** November 17, 2023 (Original Released Date: October 14, 2015)

**Also Released On:** PS Vita, PS4, Switch, Android, PC

Today, I’ve beaten another Apple Arcade game that’s been nagging me internally. After finishing Poinpy a couple years ago, I was looking into getting into its inverse/predecessor, Downwell. Both were developed by Ojiro Fumoto and published by Devolver. Poinpy is only available through subscribing to Netflix and Downwell+ is the Apple Arcade version of Downwell (that is purchasable with all its features elsewhere. While Poinpy a colorful game about flinging yourself and performing combos upwards in gameplay thats a bit more pensive. Downwell, is a fast-paced monochrome platformer, of which a controller is most recommended, about performing shooting, jumping on enemies and performing combos downwards. If I were to decide which I prefer, I would give the edge to Poinpy, as it avoids the small issues that I have with Downwell.

First thing to note is what genre Downwell presents itself as. While its easy to look and see the layout of Downwell and assume its a roguelike, the gameplay progression is gained mostly from your experience. You do unlock different “styles” of gameplay as you progrss, which will alter movement or what items you can pick up, but they get unlocked relatively early and are really just alternative ways to play (including my preferred method, Boulder, which ups your HP and lowers your item selection between levels). So while Downwell seems positioned like a roguelike, its actually more of an arcade platformer. A successful Downwell run should be about 15-20 minutes in length, but it took me about 10 hours to beat the game. 

Downwell starts with having your little white character guy jumping down a well. Its you controlling the character down the well right in the title screen, which is a cute touch. The game has 4 Worlds, each with 3 randomly generated levels and then the final boss. You progress by falling down and trying not to lose the small amount of health you have. You got gun boots with limited ammo to help you land on good ground. You get ammo back the moment you get back on solid ground. But the real important technique to downwell is knowing when to shoot and knowing when to bounce on enemies, since bouncing also gives you your reload. Not only that, but you’ll come to realize that the more enemies you kill in between moments of stepping ground, the more you raise your combo. And the higher the combo, the more perks you get. A simple combo, gets you a solid 100 gems to spend in the game’s shop. A 15 combo will add to your reward with a permanent bullet expansion. And a combo of 25 or higher with earn regenerate a health point.

But combos can be split into parts, thanks to the game’s Timevoid mechanic. Timevoids bubbles are typically doorways to break areas that will offer powerups like different guns to strap on your feet, a hoard of gems and shops for you to pick your stat upgrades with those gems. Getting to these timevoids can be tricky, since you’re falling at high speeds. Zone out and you can miss these, and hinder your run. But the timevoids themselves pause time, allowing you to think through how you want to re-approach your combo. They’re a fun in-between that lets you rethink your gameplay and make combos a touch more attainable. 

Combos are also carried in between levels. The in-between areas however are more important for the perks you get to add to your character that stack up. Some are as minor as a 4 HP increase, in case things get dire, although conveniently your Max HP increases when you receive 4 HP increases while already with a full health bar. Others will increase your shot range, or gives you defence for the enemies you missed that will now sink towards you. One gives you a 10% discount pass in shops. My favorites are the ones that cause explosions for every enemy shot or stomped, making your combos alot easier and make your run almost a fireworks show, especially when you increase your bullet count throughout the run. I wish there were just a few more perks, because having you select between 2-4 doesn’t have alot of stakes, when you’ll likely come across multiple opportunities to receive most of the powerups in a single run. I have had a few moments where the game freezes between levels early within runs. Its notable, but not super common. Regardless, it is upsetting to never know how a run can potentially go when its out of your controls

The controls however are what really makes this game shine. There’s something about vertical platforming games that I really admire. Platforming games should naturally have a sense of verticality and that’s something you can guarantee with games that prefer a portrait orientation. The movement to movement however is very nice, bouncing from enemy to enemies, the way all of the guns have either a however or a bounce to them. Or how all the guns feel from their different bullet counts and their range. All of them have upside (but I do blame not beating the game sooner because the triple spread gun isn’t optimal for the end boss). The collision can be a tad better for some of the enemies, where I was a bit shocked to lose health, rather than increase my combo, but its pretty minor to a game that otherwise has that sense of velocity and hover around to a tee. 

The game can be a bit unforgiving and its difficulty is a bit in flux. Combos have alot of risk to them and while a good run and getting combos are often seen together. Defeating 25 enemies often leads to a loss HP or 2, since combos can be maintained as long as you don’t hit ground. You’re often left with the same HP you came out with and the same coins you could have received 15 enemies prior from the chain. 

Another weird thing about the game is that it actually gets notably easier during the run. The first world is pretty easy to get from enemy to enemy, with your beginning lack of bullets being your main cause of not necessarily going through the first world with ease. The 2nd world, is spooky themed, but also the toughest. A few of the toughest enemies in the game are only in this world, including a skull that if shot once, with start attacking you and is no longer able to be jumped on without losing HP. Its either tough to lose its chase, or a stray bullet will hit it as you approach it. Another toughie, throws bone projectiles at fast rate and a tough arc. 

The subsequent water world eases in difficulty, as bouncing on the slow swimming turtles is easy and the squids which rise and shoot downwards are avoidable. The biggest issue is the air gauge exclusively to water sections that will have you lose HP when you run out of air, but even then, its pretty easy to maintain. By the time you reach the hell themed 4th world, you’re already well powered. There is an influx of enemies, but they’re slow, predictable and lack variety. Here you can just gain massive combos, especially with bouncy platforms that don’t get destroyed when you shoot them. The only real difficulty in this world comes from the lack of solid ground to finish up combos, since there’s no reason to get a combo past 25. This world is otherwise an anticlimactic powering up zone before you hit the final boss, which ramps the difficulty back up appropriately to how powerful you’ve come through the short amount of time.

Lastly, I should mention how on-point this game’s visual design is. It is a pixelated game, likely decided due to the game’s arcade roots. The game is approached designed with only a few colors telling everything, but there’s a great visual language on what platforms are good to stomp on and which should be approached with caution, just by changing the color of its surface either one color or the other. There are some fun sprites in here and the main character is simple but goofy and nicely animated. The more you play, the more you play, the more you unlock different palates with quirky names tied to them. The palates change the background and outlines to different colors. There’s some fun combinations and refresh the game a tad bit, while also avoiding progression being a tool to winning Vs. skill.

Downwell is certainly tricky and its difficulty can linger maybe a bit longer than you would prefer. I think its amplified from the difficulty mainly being in the first half, making progression feel jarring and doubting your sense of improvement. But it also checks alot of the boxes I look for in something arcadey and satisfying, especially when you consider how all weapons feel good and have different advantages. The main controls and making combos feels nice. Despite going with pixel art style, of which many people would say the art style seen in other games could feel a bit tired by this point, Downwell still stands out for being dark, somewhat foreboding, but also a touch cartoony, which is even more impressive when you consider that the game is turning 9 this year. Time flew by when I was playing, because it has such a great concept and does a good job of making you want to master it.",1b11ydt,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameCompleted/comments/1b11ydt/downwell_ios/,[]
Crippling anxiety about being caught in a mass shooting.,"25M, stuck in the US.

I never thought I’d come to this point, but I want my childhood and middle-school years back. At least back then, I felt safe being out and about. When the Aurora Theater and Sandy Hook school shootings occurred in 2012, and now I’m suddenly told it isn’t safe to venture outside of my home anymore, and politicians would rather see me die than support any gun reforms, my perception of the environment around me being a safe place was broken. I had to go to high school after that knowing each day I walked through those doors could be my last. With each major mass shooting that occurred throughout the 2010s, and gun laws being loosened rather than tightened, my anxiety intensified. I’ve been avoiding public areas and crowds long before the pandemic just for that reason alone. I only leave home when absolutely necessary, like for work or school. And I don’t talk and try to avoid eye contact with others, because you never know who might be carrying a gun. I hate that I have to live like this, but I don’t want to become part of such a gruesome statistic. It’s unfortunately the price I have to pay for living in a country where guns are more valuable than human life. With proper gun control out of reach for the forseeable future thanks to a conservative-majority Supreme Court, it looks like this is how I’m going to have to live for the rest of my life. No mass gatherings, no social life at all, no peace of mind. It’s really depressing to think about.

Going out in the world, there is a tiny percentage of risk in general. A risk that you have to take. There is no telling the future.\n\nAlso the fact there is a lot of fear mongering on the news and social media. Remember what happened with toilet paper and covid? Even my stress was badly triggered during that time. But I made the realization that while Covid is something that shouldn't be taken lightly. But I'm not going to let it control my life. You shouldn't let the very unlikely chance of you being shot control you either. Life is too short already, get out there and have some fun!\n\nAs for firearms and my stance on it, I'm not sharing.

But not everyone is that lucky. It hurts me to know that so many people and children have to be afraid of shootings nowadays, and it’s even worse that the fear isn’t even illogical. The Robb elementary shooting genuinely messed me up. I think this one hurt more than the others since I was older and better understood the weight of the situation considering I was only in elementary/middle school during the sandy hook shooting and others. I’m 20 now. I remember feeling so angry at the world, and what I felt was nothing in comparison to what those parents and children had to feel. It baffles me how one person can be so evil and cruel. \n\nI truly don’t know how to stop feeling so afraid because the truth is we have a right to be.

Limit Exposure to Media: Constant exposure to news and social media coverage of mass shootings can exacerbate anxiety. Try to limit your exposure to such content and take breaks from media if needed.\n2. Focus on Safety Measures: Take practical steps to increase your sense of safety and preparedness. This could include familiarizing yourself with emergency exits in public places, knowing how to respond in an active shooter situation, and participating in safety drills if available.\n3. Practice Relaxation Techniques: Engage in relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to help reduce feelings of anxiety and promote a sense of calm.\n4. Seek Support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your fears and concerns. Sharing your feelings can help alleviate some of the anxiety and provide support during difficult times.\n5.

A *Long* Short Story Of Why I Love This Game,"    
***disclaimer: I am not liable for the amount of time or life lost in the reading of whatever amount of this story is to be read, continue at your own risk ***

      I finally get a day off work and decide to spend it making myself space rich. I log into a server, it seems like it’s running ok enough so I fire up the old reclaimer and head off to gobble some hammerheads. 

Two loads in I’m stacking the janky boxes and the server decides to have a seizure and I must have somehow smoked myself with a 16 SCU crate because at first I fall to the floor, I stand up and then wham, I’m unconscious. 

I decide to not use the rescue beacon for fear of pirates stealing my loots and figure I’ll fly back to my corpse marker and retrieve my ship before getting the hell off this server before it explodes. 

I backspace and wake up in the medical center on Area 18 as planned, only problem is, no corpse marker. I figure if I fly over to Crusader near where I died, it might show up.  I hop in my Inferno and go to reclaim my reclaimer. 

Unfortunately after 30 minutes of searching the marker never showed, maybe since I had dropped out of quantum in the middle of nowhere and I was getting ready to give up and log out when I see an alert “Mission: Capture the Idris”. 


     The Idris marker is all the way across the system around Aberdeen. Fortunately I was already geared up and in a combat ship so I figured I might as well check it out. I quickly accepted the mission, plotted the point and headed towards Hurston. 

As the ship was about 300km from the comms array in atmo I chose to come down from orbit to check out the situation. 

I arrived cautiously, sending out scanning pulses as I didn’t know what to expect. There was one guy in a hawk shooting the rear shields and the Idris didn’t seem to be shooting back. I took up position behind him and started unloading into the shield. 

It didn’t take long with both of us combined shooting to drop the shields, probably because he had already been shooting and the Idris wasn’t moving. 

He kept shooting for some reason but I didn’t have time to figure out why because others started to arrive and targeted me! Now was the time to see if I could land in the bay. 

I slammed the throttle forward and crashed into the bay, jumped out of the Inferno’s cockpit and was actually inside on floor of the Idris, mostly in one piece. I took notice of the smoldering wreckage around me and some corpses. Someone had already beat me to the punch. 
 
     Bullets flew past my head and I spun to shoot my attacker, I unloaded a full clip with accuracy but the bullets phased right through what I determined to be an NPC. From cover I fired at others with the same result. No confirmed kills.  

The server desync would be my shield as well as theirs so I ran through the hail of bullets unscathed and found my way into the winding corridor that leads to the bridge.  

On the bridge I saw 2 guys in heavy armor manning the captain and copilot chairs but the Idris didn’t move. I thought maybe if I put my gun away as a show of good faith they wouldn’t be aggressive to me.

I watched them for a while, either they didn’t know how to operate the ship or couldn’t as it just sat 5000km above the surface of Aberdeen in the thick, dusty atmosphere. The one in the captains seat stood up and walked away and I saw this as my moment to the seize the chair, it was worth the risk. 

No obvious  control of the ship was present to me even after attempting the usual prompts so I just reveled in the glory of being in the captains seat of the magnificent Aegis Idris. 

The feeling was short lived however as I heard the bridge doors open, I rose to see who it was coming through as a red laser swept onto me, I returned fire but it was too late, I was down. 

As I lay bleeding out on the floor, winking in and out of existence, I heard more gunfire and saw movement around me, but I wasn’t sure who had lived, the gunman or my two previous cohorts. 

     I reached out to chat to request healing even though I could barely see through the fog of near death, no response. I tried to send out a med beacon, people accepted but were unable to reach us. I heard the quantum drive of the Idris spin up and got the sense we were moving so someone must have taken control of the ship. 

People were attempting to group with me to track the Idris when the idea came to me to try proximity voice chat.  “Hey I mean you guys no harm, if you revive me on the bridge I can help you.” I wait anxiously to hear if I’m among friends or foes. 

“You are on the bridge?” I hear, in broken English. “Yes!” I’m friendly and I can help you if you revive me!”, I say. 

As the last vestiges of life fade from my body I see a silhouette of someone above me, and then I am once again among the living . 

I am not whole as I was before though, a quick assessment of my condition reveals I have a tier 1 head injury. “Are you good, friend?” I hear. My new companion must have recognized from my hunched over appearance that I was wounded. 

      “Come with me to the med bay, I will try to protect you” he says, in a foreign accent I had yet to identify.  Again I hear the quantum drive. We must be running while they figure out a plan to defend the ship. 

I hobble slowly down the hallway towards the med bay I saw on the way in. My vision is getting blurrier by the minute and everything sounds fuzzy and hollow. Once at the med bay all I discover is disappointment, part of the Idris that must not be finished yet is the functioning medbed in the “surgical room”. 

“I’m sorry it’s not working, do you think you can see well enough to man a turret? We need to stop and fight.” He asks me. “I can sure as hell try”, I reply. 

He leads me as I limp back down the hall to a turret. As I enter the turret I hear explosions outside, we must be under attack already. 

    I can barely see anything at all at this point because of my injuries but I spin the turret around and see several red contacts. I pick the closest one, aim as best I can and begin blasting. I hear the familiar “tink tink tink” of shots landing and BOOM, kill. 

I can hear my teammates speaking what I now know to be German, but it’s distorted by
my concussion with an increasing echo and I now notice there is more than two of them because the other turrets were firing along with mine. 

All of a sudden they go wild with excitement as they vaporize what seemed like multiple ships with what I assume was the Idris’s main guns. 

Space is on fire with all the burning wreckage around us and we quantum away to regroup for another engagement, if only I could SEE. 

     I think back to my foundation festival experience, a guide for the medical gameplay showed me that some injuries could be treated with the med gun. I never had to use it before now but I exit the turret and turn the med gun on myself. 

It tells me that if I use a certain drug on myself it will temporarily treat my condition. “Yes!” I crank up the drug but not too much, I think I remember him saying too much could kill me or something. 

We are back in battle again and I am back in the turret, target, aim, shoot, kill! Ship after ship is falling before the might of the Idris! Oh no, the drugs are wearing off. Rinse and repeat in and out of the turret dosing myself to be able to see for long enough to get back into the fight. 

    An explosion rocks the ship, people are getting frustrated and starting to kamikaze into us!  I blast as many as I can but the stars are full of hostile ships, and then I see it. 

The guy who originally shot me has returned to finish the job! As if fate itself were on this man’s side my drugs have worn off and I’m blind again! Not having time to redose, I turn the full fury of my turret on him and blast until the capacitor is dry. 

I must have clipped his wing because it looked as if he were spiraling out of control but between my blindness and his skill he managed to evade enough of my shots to plow his ship into our wounded beast and the last thing I saw through my darkened, blurry vision was a massive fireball as our ship exploded in what must have been a grand finale. 

So ended my time with the crazy Germans that stole the Idris and for an hour or so did glorious battle with what seemed like the entire server. I woke up in the medbed of Area 18 and I could could finally see.

While this may not be the greatest story or adventure that has ever happened to anyone in Star Citizen, it is most certainly mine, and that’s good enough for me.

What do you think about a Harry Potter game leaning more towards a shooter?,"Harry Potter and/or shooter fans what do you think of this game idea if it interests you?

Star Wars battlefront but it is Harry Potter instead of Star Wars themed. Probably made by someone else because DICE is not DiCE anymore. They fucked up Star Wars Battlefront II and Battlefield 2042, but that is a whole other conversation. I get this isn’t for everyone so I’m mainly looking for discussion from those this type of game would interest.

Imagine getting to wreak havoc on the battlefield as Voldemort/Dumbledore casting a giant defensive water bubble to block a fiery serpent spell. Spawning as a giant/dementor/Centaur/Hippogriff heavy unit.

Spending match accumulated galleons to drink a polyjuice potion and sneaking into the enemy back line as a spy similar to Team Fortress. A hero unit on your team allowing you to apparate to a certain location on the battlefield. 

Duoing with a teammate as their patronus if you have both met a teamwork quest in that life. Where you have to stay close together to extend it’s duration. Using a port key or flu powder to change defensive locations.

Normal troops would just be wizards with a basic attack,charge attack to break shields; and a skill based counter that is harder to pull off versus tougher units with maybe a temporary shield cooldown ability so you don’t get 1 shot all the time by hero units. Grenades would be potions and guns would be wand types. 

Even could throw in an ultimate/super spell in the load out builds using less flashy spells. Giving you something to build up to during that life enabling you to take down non-basic units better. Think a Leviosa for heavy unit crowd control or flying on a broom.

So much you could do with it and it leans perfectly well into a Heroes versus Villians game mode too. Heaps of memorable characters that could have unique gameplay abilities and varying builds. Hagrid, Arthur Weasley, Werewolf Fenrir Greyback, Pettigrew, etc. Easy to fill in roles like heavy assault, stealth, support with such as diverse lineup. Not to mention flexibility with skins.

Fighting locations would be hard to come by without breaking outside of what happened in the books, but destruction/map evolution(Think Battlefield 4) would be a nice component. Ministry of Magic, Hogwarts, Quidditch world championship are easy locks for battles. Probably add in the burrow and Number 12 Grimmauld place last year escape where Hedwig dies for smaller player count maps and game modes.

You could have a fantastic beasts season or if you need to go off script a Rita Skeeter playlist of battles that “happened” such as Gringotts, Malfoy Manor, but they are embellished to change the scale of the battle. Could even be battles that didn’t happen such as Hogsmeade or Diagonal Alley because of the lack of credibility she has.

I just want to be able to experience the magic on top of tried and true shooter components. Imagine comms like “Snape is reading my mind. They have enhanced radar. don’t push”, “Umbridge just spawned in and chose a curse decree stay behind cover, no counters for 30 seconds”, “Dobby just cancelled out my super then dissapparrated, I can’t wait to unlock him”, “I’m about to complete Hermione’s study assignment and get 25% damage reduction let me go in first”, “Madeye do you see anyone behind this wall?”, “I just saw McGonagall run by she’s an orange cat under the death eater symbol in the sky”, “Bellatrix is using the Cruciatus curse, get her she can’t move right now.”

It would be so refreshing and it’s really missing this type of game from the HP IP when they are sitting on a goldmine of untapped potential.

I wanted to type out my dream game and after typing this all out I figured I’d try to share it in a post. I imagine I’ll get hate because it’s Harry Potter, but damn even then the gameplay would be fun if you look at it outside of a Harry Potter lens too.",1b112e0,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotterGame/comments/1b112e0/what_do_you_think_about_a_harry_potter_game/,"[""Welcome to r/HarryPotterGame!

##Khojaly and Stepanakert, 1992

Czech journalist Dana Mazalova recalls her interaction with Azerbaijani doctor and journalist Chingiz Mustafayev about the events in and around Khojaly.

**MAZALOVA:** I left Agdam to meet Chengiz. He showed me the recordings that he took in Karabakh. He was shook. *""Dana, do you understand what they have done?"",* he told me, adding that now there is a target on his back for making these revelations. 

**REPORTER:** What was in those tapes? 

**MAZALOVA:** Chingiz flew in an Azerbaijani helicopter and noticed the bodies from above. There were Azeri soldiers near the bodies; they weren't concerned about the Azerbaijani helicopter flying around. Chingiz then filmed the victims up close. He was a doctor so he explained how they were killed. I only later learned that Armenians had given a corridor for Azeri civilians to leave Khojaly. Chingiz filmed the bodies in Azeri-controlled areas near Agdam.

Chingiz analyzed how they were killed. The victims were shot in their knees to prevent them from escaping. It must have been a slow and painful death, also a loud death, loud enough for Azeri soldiers stationed in nearby positions to hear. [shows a map] Here is the map of Khojaly, here is the corridor given by Armenians to the civilians, and here is Agdam and the area near Agdam where the bodies were filmed by Chingiz.  

Chingiz was able to transport around half of the bodies to Agdam. He then returned to transfer the other bodies to discover that they were mutilated within those 2 days when he was away. 

**REPORTER:** And this was in an Azeri-controlled area?

**MAZALOVA:** Exactly. 

**REPORTER:** So it's unlikely that Armenians came and mutilated the bodies after their death? 

**MAZALOVA:** Correct. That would make no sense. I remember a small boy in a pink hat who was mutilated. Chingiz told me he was afraid of walking in Baku without a bulletproof vest because he documented it all. 

**REPORTER:** So Chingiz concluded that Azeris themselves mutilated the bodies, not Armenians?

**MAZALOVA:** Yes. 

**REPORTER:** Did he say why the Azeri soldiers would do that?

**MAZALOVA:** No. We were both shocked. The next morning I went to speak with [Azerbaijani President] Mutallibov. I had to ask him about it. Mutallibov believed the events were organized by [nationalist Azeri forces] Popular Front Party to overthrow his administration. That is what happened shortly afterward. 

**REPORTER:** What did President Mutallibov say?

**MAZALOVA:** He believed it was done to create a scandal and remove him from power. 

**REPORTER:** So the [nationalist] Popular Front Party didn't care because the victims were ethnic Meskhetians and not Azeri?

**MAZALOVA:** Correct. Moreover, under the Islamic rules you are supposed to bury the body immediately but that is not what they did. They kept those bodies in Agdam in a small house. Meanwhile, I flew to Prague to prepare for a КБСЕ conference dedicated to the Karabakh conflict. Azerbaijan's foreign minister attended it. Several weeks had passed. Azeris kept the rotting corpses for weeks to display them before the conference. My colleague and a representative of КБСЕ paid a visit around the end of March and the bodies were still kept there for display. They wanted to derail the conference. The [Azeri nationalist forces] were capable of sacrificing Meskhetians or any other ethnic group to derail the conference, which did end up being delayed. The conference was the first international probe to discuss what to do with the Karabakh conflict. They [Azeri forces] successfully stopped it. //

Comments by the Azeri doctor/journalist Chingiz Mustafayev, the colleague of Dana Mazalova who visited the aforementioned site and recorded the bodies. *Note: This is not in Khojaly, this is an area between Khojaly and Agdam.*

**MUSTAFAYEV:** I arrived in Agdam on February 28 and asked them for permission to film the tragedy. They told me the bodies were located only in Khojaly and that there were negotiations to exchange POWs and bodies. People from Khojaly then informed me that civilians came from Khojaly and hid near a farm. I requested permission to go there but was denied. The following day I convinced the pilot to change the route. When we reached the aforementioned farm I saw over 50 bodies on the ground. Around 10 Azeri soldiers were walking near the bodies. The area is 10 km from Khojaly and only 700 meters from our military outpost. This is the area I was told that I couldn't visit due to a shootout with Armenians. We safely landed, and as soon as we did, several Azeri helicopters left the area toward Agdam, and so did the 10 soldiers who were walking near the bodies. We spent 45 minutes near the bodies and recorded them. 

We later saw two vehicles of Armenian soldiers passing nearby. They spotted us so we began to walk toward Agdam. They never fired a single shot toward us. To this day I cannot wrap my head around the fact that the bodies were only 700 meters from our military position and our soldiers were freely walking there yet nobody bothered to pick them up. I have all the evidence recorded on tape but I'm under the impression that the dark forces that have masterminded all of this are plotting another crime while the investigative commission drags its foot. //

Azerbaijan's president believed the opposition was using the Khojaly incident to overthrow him and that his orders to evacuate civilians in advance were ignored on purpose:

**MUTALLIBOV:** As the rescued residents of Khojaly say, it was a plot to create grounds for my resignation. I don’t think that the Armenians, who had manifested a clear and knowledgeable approach to such situations, would have allowed Azerbaijanis to obtain evidence that tied them to fascist acts. If I declare that it was the fault of the Azerbaijani opposition I could be blamed for slander. But the overall picture of the conclusions is as follows: the Armenians had, in any case, provided a corridor to let the civilians escape. Why then would they shoot? As soon as Khojaly was surrounded by tanks it was necessary to immediately lead the civilians out. Earlier I had given similar orders regarding Shushi – to evacuate women and children and to leave only men in the city. It’s one of the laws of war – civilians must be rescued. My conduct was appropriate and unambiguous – I gave such orders, but why they weren’t followed in Khojaly is not clear to me. //

Earlier in February the Armenian forces warned the Azeri units stationed in Khojaly that because of Azerbaijan's bombardment of the Armenian capital Stepanakert, they would have to capture Khojaly to end the fire. Human Rights Watch says Azeris were using GRAD missile systems stationed in Khojaly to bombard Stepanakert, killing hundreds of Armenian civilians.

Armenians urged the Azeri army to evacuate their civilians from Khojaly ahead of the assault. The fact that Armenians warned about a possible assault was confirmed by Azerbaijani newspapers. The Human Rights Watch notes that by continuing to operate next to civilians and by continuing to wear military uniforms, the local Azerbaijani forces endangered the civilians.

**SALMAN ABASOV (Azeri):** Several days before the tragedy the Armenians told us several times over the radio that they would capture the town and demanded that we leave it. For a long time, helicopters flew into Khojaly and it wasn't clear if anyone thought about our fate. We received practically no help. Moreover, when it was possible to take our women and children out of the town, we were persuaded not to do so [by Azerbaijani authorities/forces]. //

Elmar Mammadov, the Mayor of Khojaly testified that the Azerbaijani authorities knew about the planned assault but they took no measure to evacuate the civilians.

Azerbaijani filmmaker Ramiz Fataliev testified that the Azerbaijani authorities did not evacuate the civilians from Khojaly because they thought that by doing so they would ""invite"" the Armenians to occupy Khojaly.
 
Armenians launched the assault against Azeri forces in Khojaly on February 25 and the population began to march towards Azerbaijan. Several civilians were killed by the Armenian forces in Khojaly during the assault.

A group of Azeri civilians used a corridor provided by Armenian forces to flee. The second group used another route. According to HRW, a column of civilians were accompanied by Azeri soldiers. As the group and the soldiers approached the border with Azerbaijan, the nearby Armenian positions opened fire at them. Helsinki Watch says that the Azeri soldiers, still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the civilians while fleeing. According to eyewitness accounts, there was a shootout between these Azeri forces and nearby Armenian positions.

International observers say that Armenian soldiers were responsible for the deaths because they did not exercise precautionary measures to minimize civilian casualties and that the Azerbaijani side also shared responsibility for endangering its own civilians by breaching humanitarian obligations. 

**HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:** The parties may not use civilians to shield military targets from attack or to shield military operations including retreats. Thus a party that intersperses combatants with fleeing civilians puts those civilians at risk and violates its obligation to protect its own civilians. //

Azerbaijani journalist Eynulla Fatullayev said he met refugees from Khojaly who said that the Armenians had indeed left a free corridor and the Armenian soldiers positioned behind the corridor had not opened fire on them. Some soldiers from Azerbaijan's National Front instead, for some reason, had led part of the refugees in the direction of the village of Nakhichevanik, which during that period had been under the control of the Armenians' Askeran battalion. The other group of refugees were hit by artillery volleys while they were reaching the Agdam Region. Fatullayev later retracted his report. He was persecuted by the Azerbaijani regime.

##Armenia continues to ""boycott"" Russian-led CSTO military bloc

Belarus held Parliamentary elections on February 25. The representative of CSTO said the representatives of Armenia in the CSTO Parliamentary Assembly did not send election observers to Belarus. *""CSTO observers are present from almost every country except Armenia. As you know, the CSTO PA is a collegial body and they should have attended such a socio-political event, but it is their choice.""*

##Lukashenko: the CSTO will be fine without Armenia 

Russia said there is no such thing as ""freezing"" a membership under CSTO rules so they will request further clarification from Armenia. 

**BELARUS:** We react to Armenia's statements about freezing CSTO activities quite calmly. If they do not want to be in the CSTO, the organization will not collapse, it will not be destroyed. I advise the Armenian side not to rush with any decision. Did Armenia expect CSTO to engage in war against Azerbaijan? Don't exit CSTO and don't freeze anything. Leaving is easy, returning is hard. //

Lukashenko again accused Armenia's former administrations of ""not wanting to resolve the conflict with Azerbaijan"" and ""delaying it until everything fell on Pashinyan's shoulders"", adding that what happened in 2020 has little to do with Pashinyan's policies and that the current situation is the ""most acceptable"" for a final resolution. He criticized Pashinyan for rejecting the offer to invest billions of dollars in Armenia in exchange for the peaceful surrender of Karabakh territories, an offer that was made to previous administrations as well. *""Don't be mad at us now. You asked for a war, you got a war.""*

##journalist Tatul Hakobyan about Pashinyan-Kremlin and Armenia-Russia relations 

**HAKOBYAN:** Armenia's opposition forces are surprised that Russia is not doing enough to bring Kocharyan and Serj back to power. Russia can, undoubtedly, change the administration in Armenia but it is not in their best interest right now. Moreover, it's quite convenient for Russia to see Pashinyan in power at this time. 

Turkey and Azerbaijan are far more important for Russia. The Kremlin accuses Pashinyan of being pro-Western and attempting to bring the West to the South Caucasus. By keeping Pashinyan in power, Russia is able to convince part of the Armenian population that it's all Pashinyan's fault that Armenia is in an endless nightmare and that it's because of his administration that we lost the war. 

I have said many times that Pashinyan, as the leader, is the #1 figure responsible for the losses, but he is responsible because he continued the policies adopted by Kocharyan and Serj. 

Pashinyan and his ""pro-West"" team are an excellent scapegoat for Russia to justify its failure to fulfill its strategic and contractual obligations. One day this could change again if Armenia becomes more important than Azerbaijan. Then Russia would no longer need Pashinyan and removing him would be a matter of weeks. //

##ex-Maj Gen of Indian army about Armenia

As we learned earlier, Armenia's ruling party sent a representative to establish ties with India's ruling BJP party and discuss strategic relations. An Indian official praised the Armenia-France-India cooperation.

Katoch emphasized the importance of Armenia's Crossroads of Peace project in the context of the infrastructure projects in the Indian Ocean.
Last week the President of France expressed support for the Crossroads of Peace project, calling it an opportunity for France to access the Central Asian market.

##ruling party approved the candidacy of Gevorg Papoyan for the position of Economy Minister 

Papoyan, 37, is the head of parliament's finance & budget committee. He resigned as MP on Monday to proceed with the appointment.

##... the new economy minister about Armenia's reliance on Russia and raising product standards to capture the EU market 

**REPORTER:** The detained ex-Minister Vahan Kerobyan was obviously pro-West. During last year's closure at Upper Lars, he adopted an anti-Russia stance and was searching for alternative markets. Will you try to find alternatives to EAEU?

**PAPOYAN:** But there are also people who believe Kerobyan was pro-Russia. I will be neither. I will be pro-Armenian. Diversification of markets would benefit Armenia. It's necessary for a stable development. It's not done ""against"" Russia. 

**REPORTER:** Some Armenian businesses say 80% of their market is in Russia. They say no matter how much they've tried, no other market came close. Europeans don't need Armenian cognac. How will you try to diversify? Will you first try to capture a market in the EU before moving away from Russia?

**PAPOYAN:** Today we are selling 100 bottles: 80 in Russia and 20 in Europe. Diversification does not mean selling 60 in Russia and 40 in Europe. Diversification means selling 100 in Russia and another 100 in Europe. This is how you develop the economy. It's a challenge that we must tackle. For example, the subpar standards of Armenian dairy products don't allow them to be sold in Europe. We will discuss with our producers to introduce new technologies, closed-cycle systems, and higher quality and safety standards. How much would it cost to raise the standards? I assume our producers have thought about this and came to the conclusion that it ""wasn't worth it"". The state must help them raise these standards. This is something that needs to be calculated.

**REPORTER:** Have you already had a chance to examine Kerobyan's legacy and the undelivered promises? What can be done for ferry and dry port projects? 

**PAPOYAN:** I was literally on my way to hold meetings to discuss those topics. We will assess what's feasible and what's not, and what could use additional funds from the Parliament. I have resigned as an MP and my mandate will be officially terminated 7 days from now, after which I'll have the opportunity to be appointed as Minister.

##Civil Aviation Committee presented the 2023 activities and reforms to PM Pashinyan 

8 new airlines entered Armenia.

Air traffic rose by 47% to a record 5,415,076. 

Domestic airlines handled 1.8 million flights (+33%). 

**PASHINYAN:** Did you make the airlines safer by raising the standards?

**COMMITTEE:** There is a round-the-clock monitoring process. Each auditing division has a checklist. No airline can avoid inspections. We have agreed to make this a permanent practice. The audit is not done once or twice a year, it's a frequent cycle. //

500 new jobs were created in the aviation sector last year. 

The first Boeing 737/400 cargo jet was imported to Armenia by Hayways airline last year. It will begin to transfer cargo starting next month after obtaining a certification. This will be the first (?) Armenian airline to specialize in cargo transportation, said Infrastructure Minister Thanosyan.

Lufthansa Cargo has entered the Armenian market. 

To meet the European standards and leave the blacklist, the Committee trained new inspectors. The process continues.

##S&P expects Armenia's economy to grow by 6.2% in 2024; Armenian government expects 7%

The external factors are expected to be offset by growth in domestic consumption, public investment in infrastructure, and private investment aimed, in particular, at integrating displaced persons from Nagorno-Karabakh.

>S&P Global Ratings said the rating affirmation is based on the country's strong economic growth prospects, consistent availability of external financing and a framework of prudent macroeconomic policies, which has helped maintain the country's macroeconomic and financial stability in recent years despite numerous external shocks.

...

>The stable outlook reflects, on the one hand, Armenia's favorable economic growth prospects and the government's maintenance of public debt at a stable and manageable level, and on the other hand, the existing external balance of payments and geopolitical risks.

The **Arabo fighters had then unsheathed the knives they had carried on their hips for along, and began stabbing**.\n\n\n>[…] until Khojalu, Armenian fighters had spared women and children, either releasing them or holding them hostage for prisoner exchanges.\n\n*My brother’s road* Pages 213-214.\n\n\nThe only debatable part of this entire thing is whether or not Armenians mutilated the bodies, which Mazalova and Mustafayev agree on. That the bodies were left to rot, and “worked” on for political theatre.\n\n\nComparatively to the “40 **beheaded** children” in Israel, which was untrue. The use of mutilations is political, it does not matter whether people were killed by a gunshot wound, burned by a missile, or killed with a stick, or burned by the stake. Those semantics are used to push agenda. Which Azerbaijan successfully did.\n\n\nMoreover, the HRW thing is taken out of context u/ar_david_hh \n\nThe report is talking on Human shields. Which is a specific type of act of **deliberately** putting civilians at risk, usually by **paying them** a certain amount of money. And uses that sentence to set up the continuation. Since Azeris did not organize a march with civilians to have an attack, but were forced to mix because they were fleeing an attack through 1 corridor we provided. For everyone…\n\n\nBut as the **original HRW report continues**.\n\n\n>Although retreating combatants and civilians assume a combatants role while fleeing are subject to direct individualized attack, **the attacking party is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties.** IN PARTICULAR the pary must **suspend an attack** if it becomes apparent that the attack may be expected to cause civilian casualties that area excessive to the **concrete and direct military advantage anticipated**. (EG: fleeing and retreating forces and civilians)\n\nThe HRW continues.\n\n>The Circumastnace surrounding the attack at Nakhichevanik on those fleeing Khojaly indicate that Armenian forces and the troops of the 366th CIS regiment **deliberately disregarded this customary law restraints on attacks**. NK officials and fighters **clearly expected the inhabitants of Khojaly to flee** since they **claim to have informed the town that a corridor would be left open**.\n\n\n>Under these circumstances, the killing of fleeing combatants could not justify the foreseeably large number of civilian casualties.\n\nhttps://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/1992%20Bloodshed%20in%20Cauc%20-%20Escalation%20in%20NK.pdf\n\nWhich is very logical for anyone with 2 braincells.\n\n\nEven if they had combatants mixed with civilians, it’s not as if they are attacking another village while fleeing.\n\n\nBlame it on miscommunication, blame it on the Aramo and Arabo battalions. Armenians committed the massacre, end of story.']"
Can Twice make Noumu clones?,"This just popped in my brain.What if AFO made a glass cannon Noumu (think poison blood,expbosion on death,fire breath, and gun hands)?Could Twice have cloned it and release them throuout Hosu?Could Shigaraki control these Noumus?",1b10pzp,17,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1b10pzp/can_twice_make_noumu_clones/,"[""They're clones, so yes.\n\nThat's one of the reasons Hawks killed Twice.

Aimtrak mapping as trigger not responding for mapping in Batocera,"Hi, feeling a bit dense, I have an aimtrak lightgun that works in Windows and everything looks OK via the AimTrack app. However, in Batocera 37 and updated 38 it shows up something like ""onehit onehit"" when plugged in.

The pointer actually tracks around the screen in the main game list menu.

And even though buttons work in Batocera Nav, when you go into the configure controller section none of the buttons or trigger on the gun initiate mapping or calibration.

Most guns are used for recreation and hunting. More guns are used for self defense even if just brandishing it without ever needing to fire it than for killing innocent people especially if excluding the half of gun deaths from suicides since taking away one tool while refusing to address the underlying issues will not solve that issue. Sure I\'d support better firearm storage so long as it doesn\'t entirely render the firearm unaccessible if it is needed for self defense, but those aren\'t the laws being proposed when discussing gun control.

Did I force a player to kill their character?,"So last nights game we had our first character death. For context...  
The Coterie consists of:  
\-Mafia Ventrue with hella dominate  
\-Cartel Hecate who is essentially the group assassin  
\-Philanthropist Tremere that is incredibly talented with blood magic

The coterie of vampires tracked down someone who attacked one of their servants. The Hecate and the Tremere go inside the abandoned apartment complex where they tracked them to, the Ventrue stays outside with his ghoul to keep lookout.

The pair of vampires creep into the building, fail their auspex rolls to percieve an ambusher but that was out of their control. They get to the third floor where they see a door ajar and try to perceive anyone nearby. They notice two men with guns waiting to ambush them as soon as they get into the door. They also hear heavy breathing, erratic and almost unhinged from behind the apartment door. What was behind it was a big angry brujah with a sledgehammer about to ruin their day.   


Strangely, to my surprise, the hecate just decides to open the door. Combat ensues, the brujah and hecate go at it, no progress is made. The two ghouls that were in wait open fire on the tremere who blocks said bullets with his blood shield. A nosferatu breaks obfuscate and attempts to stake the hecate, fails horrendously and fucks off to avoid retailation.  


The Ventrue enters the building after hearing the gunshots, finds themselves in front of a malkavian suddenly who tries to dominate him. Also fails. The Ventrue decides to dominate him back and tells him to ""Wait inside my car for me""  


And here comes the cliff notes.  
\-Combat continues, the ambushers are botching everything, even their last ditch effort with a molotov ends poorly.  
\-The tremere uses fire of the blood(or whatever its called) on the enemy brujah and scores a critical success with something stupid like 9 success(More than enough to drop the big angry bastard)  
\-The Hecate stakes the Nossie  
\-The two poor ghouls were devoured promptly and disposed of.  


Afterwards, the trio heads back to the car to find the Malkavian not there(Jk he was just obfuscated) but revealed himself in the backseat once everyone was inside. He knew he was essentially boned, his group was all incapacitated and the Ventrue has a reputation for being a torturing murderous SOB. The Malk pulled the only card he had and stated that he'll detonate the hand grenade in his pocket if they do something stupid. They tried to negotiate, the Ventrue trying to catch his eyes but the man clearly not allowing it because....ya know.

Then...dumb shit happens.

The Ventrue wants to negotiate and absolutely has the ability to get out of this with his intimidation, he's a real scary bastard with a reputation to match. He's in the middle of doing so when the Tremere *subtly* hands the Hecate a dagger coated with his own blood. I immediately see the flaw in this plan but decide that the Tremere has a backup because he wouldn't just bank on torporing the-

**That's exactly what he was banking on.**  
The Hecate slams the dagger into the Malkavian's chest. Dealing a little damage. Then scorpion's touch activates.   
The Tremere player's eyes however go wide as he's reading his ability. When I tell him to roll Strength+Blood Sorcery, it seems like he was unsure if he had the right ability. He dealt his damage and was confused to see that it did not paralyze him. Because the description on the app states that it's a paralyzing poison, however he did not actually know what the power did.   


I decided that it would be stupid for everyone in the car to just...die. So I allowed an action from everyone. Everyone ran out of the car, the tremere zipped the fuck away, the Ventrue was barely out of his seat and got tackled to safety by his ghoul who was going to take the brunt of the blast and likely sacrifice himself(Honestly the Ventrue probably would have died too at this range. The Hecate leaps onto the Malk to take the blast. She had a health pool of 7 and toughness activated, but we collectively found that a grenade does not do superficial damage to vampires. She ate the blast, which destroyed her character.  


The Tremere was understandably upset at himself, we called a break and let him shed a few tears. The Hecate player comforted him, being very understanding that it was just a mistake! Meanwhile, I'm worried that I forced her hand. Maybe I could have handled the situation better? I feel like I made a wrong step somewhere, by just making the Malk Succeed the dominate instead? Or removing his grenade.

&#x200B;",1b0z2yh,40,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/vtm/comments/1b0z2yh/did_i_force_a_player_to_kill_their_character/,"[""I fail to see how you forced her hand. You gave them an action to flee, or at least get into a positionwhere you could plausibly fudge the damage enough to let them live. They chose to jump on the grenade.   \n\n\nIs the player upset with you over this, or accusing you of forcing them? If not, I wouldn't worry about it."", ""Some thoughts here:\n\n1. This sounds like a good session and a good set of players. Things should be alright so long as you communicate effectively.\n\n2. Were I in your position, if I realized my player did not understand his ability, I would have explained what the ability does in the moment. I'd do this because mistakes should always come from character decisions, not OOC misunderstandings. \n\n3. Unless you put the idea in her head and pushed it, I don't see how you forced the Hecate player to jump on the grenade. It was her decision.\n\n4. Did the Hecate player understand that a grenade would not deal superficial damage to her? \n\n5. ...Do hand grenades not deal superficial damage to vampires? It's just shrapnel and concussive force, so I don't see why a Kindred wouldn't be put into Torpor even if they were bisected - so long as they arent decapitated by the blast.\n\n6. I would have the Hecate be in Torpor now after getting blown in half, but not dead. Just as a sign of goodwill to you and your players. That is, unless your players are okay with the beat of her death, because this doesn't sound like a bad story to me from the outside."", ""You as an ST have power to adjust what is going on if it feels right.\n\nFirst, it's good to always make sure your players know what their powers are doing. If someone misunderstands the power, give them oppotunity to change their action. I've seen people like Jason Carl do it, does not seem to be a problem.\n\nSecond, before something happens the things you have not shown to players are completely up to you to change. Malk could be bluffing. He could have had some old grenade that could go off in a smaller blast. I've seen my ST adjust things on the fly multiple times.\n\nThat said, some players are completely ok with their characters dying. If you want you can talk to your player to find out if they are ok and if not, maybe put their character into torpor instead?"", 'Final Death feels a little overboard unless they took the grenade directly to the heart or head it sounds more like a case for damage torpor than final death.\n\n\\------------------------\n\nOverall the main thing probably would be that this is a case of it would have been acceptable to rewind time based on their character would have known the knowledge they got wrong about the discipline, especially given blood sorcery is as much learned.', 'A general Storytelling thought and then a few game rules thoughts.\n\n**Storytelling**\n\n*Generally speaking*, I assume my players know what their characters do. If they do something which wouldn\'t make sense for their characters to do due to player ignorance, I warn them first or give them very short-term retcons. In this case, the Tremere player clearly didn\'t understand the rules, meaning that their character did something wildly out of character, which feels a bit off. Even if it\'s their own fault, I\'d still have pointed this out - especially as winding back the knife & Blood spilling wouldn\'t have changed the scene or RP at all until that point that it was used.\n\nI\'d also ask why the Hecata character went along with it, as it feels pretty meta-gamey to me based on the description so far. Either they really trust the Tremere character and just blindly stab people with their Blood, or their character also acted out of character by stabbing someone with non-paralytic poison, or they had no reason for it outside of meta knowledge by the player. I\'m being a bit mean here, but I can see a world in which the only reason the Hecata character stabbed the opponent is because the Tremere player told the Hecata player what was going on, even though the Hecata character had no way to understand or believe that it would be paralysing. \n\nThus not only did the Tremere act out of character due to bad info, but so did the Hecata character, and both Tremere and Hecata also metagamed a bit. All around, a good reason for a slight retcon at the time - but that\'s something to learn for future!\n\n**Rules**\n\n1) Unless it was an incendiary grenade, it likely wouldn\'t cause Final Death unless you as the Storyteller rule it. It\'d probably cause Superficial Health damage against Kindred unless Storyteller fiat happens and it happens to explode the head, or something. Your handling of the situation was otherwise fine.\n\n2) That\'s not how Dominate works. When you Dominate someone, they become a meat puppet, without cognition. Compel will make them do a single thing, whilst Mesmerise will make them do a scene-long command. From a strict reading, telling the Malkavian to, ""Wait inside my car for me,"" will have two issues: 1) they don\'t know which you car is; 2) they can\'t wait *for* you, as they don\'t know who you are when they\'re a meat puppet. For dramatic convenience and as it\'s not being used to exploit information or anything, I might allow it in the moment, but you should bear it in mind. \n\nWith Compel you\'d be unable to do this at all, but with Mesmerise you could probably say, ""Get inside that car \\[pointing\\] and stay there,"" and it\'d work, and you\'d just have to wait a scene (or a dramatically appropriate lesser amount of time) for them to wake up. More significantly, however, when they got to the car the Malkavian should be sitting there blankly, as a meat puppet, unable to do anything of their own, until the time runs out - they certainly wouldn\'t be Obfuscated or have anything prepared. This may not ruin the Malkavian\'s plans, but it\'s worth bearing in mind.\n\n3) I\'m very impressed that the Tremere was able to bleed enough over their knife without anyone noticing!', ""I'm in agreement with a lot of others who posted that I don't think you really did anything wrong here. If you put the characters in enough dangerous situations, sometimes it just isn't going to go their way. It sounds like everyone had a lot of fun right up to the boom, and that you got some real emotion out of it. \n\nThat said, as others have noted, stifling a grenade with her body is not *necessarily* the end of a character. Checking the V5 core book, they actually use the question of whether grenade explosions cause final death as a specific example of a GM judgment call that will get different rulings at different tables. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that it isn't only weapons that do superficial damage that cause torpor instead of final death. The rules for damage actually explicitly say the default assumption is that if a vampire's health track fills with aggravated damage, they go into torpor. If the aggravated damage wasn't caused by sunlight, fire, or the teeth and claws of another supernatural being, the kindred isn't beheaded, and their body isn't *completely* destroyed by other types of damage, it isn't Final Death.\n\nIf this is the first time a player character has gotten truly mangled, this might actually be a good way to play up a new angle of vampiric existence and really drive home how different they are from humans now. She jumped on a grenade to save her fellows, fully expecting to die, only for her mangled, half-blown apart corpse to slowly reknit itself together over a long period of time."", 'It sounds like the player intentionally tried to off themselves when given the opportunity. I would just let them keep the same amount of XP and let them create a new character.', ""Wait, you're talking about the level 3 blood sorcery power, right ? It doesn't paralyze vampires iirc only if the roll is good enough *and* then it's at the next daily sleep that the vampire is put to torpor iirc ?""]"
Massive vent on people who find this funny,"(Massive vent, gets somewhat dark, dont read if your not feeling the best right now) 
I got recorded because of my tics again and I'm wondering if anyone else has had it and how they deal with it mentally? It's happened more than it should to one person now and the last time has made my tics worse due to a massive increase in anxiety and I need help dealing with it. 

It's happened so many times before but the last time has affected me the most, I think because
 1) I've been through enough to now fully understand what can happen if that video doesn't just stay in the person's phone gallery until its deleted 
2) it's the first time 2 fully grown adults have done it (I'm talking 2 people in their thirties)
3)I've been through enough to finally realise  just how screwed up it is to record someone for their disability because its ""funny"" especially when their young (I'm only recently 18 and look about 16)
4) they went out of their way to get images of my face and distinguishing features on my arms 

I'm so fed up of people treating us like we're fun entertainment or animals at a zoo to watch and be amazed by their antics. I'm not some robotic kids toy you flick a switch on and enjoy watching bounce and screech across the room. I'm someone with a disorder that's so debilitating I can't even walk up or down my stairs and have to bum shuffle up else I end up with a broken bone or a concussion. 

There's days where my partner has to feed me, she has to cut the food up and bring it up to my mouth because I can't hold it because both of my hands have gone into a dystonic and I can't move it even a centimetre. I missed years of school, lost countless friends and I'm banned from so many places because of this funny disorder.

This funny disorder has led to abuse from neighbours because of all the funny noises and funny movements. Countless calls from the council from neighbours complaining and wanting me and my partner removed from our house because of noise complaints and police rocking up at our door in the middle of the night during a tic attack because I was causing a disturbance. This funny disorder has gotten me kicked out of so many meetings and classes which destroyed my education. Being too scares to back to school after being punished for a week because I had a tic that made a teacher feel uncomfortable in class.

This funny thing meant I wasn't even allowed in to the ward my mum was on after getting a call from my aunt it could be the last time I got to see her before she passed because of these damn things (thank god she's still alive now because I don't know what I would have done otherwise.) It's lead to abuse, complete social isolation, fear of even going outside, always needing my partner by my side with health issues herself because half the time I can't function on my own.

The insane amount of injuries I've sustained from tics, the amount of time I've spent in hospital because of one of those funny little movements. The fact that I can't work because my tics are so frequent and severe I can't even leave the bed without help some days.

I've been stopped by btp nearly every time I go into a train station because I'm yelling I've got a bomb, yelling threats and swearing. Getting handcuffed by police because they've stopped me to question me and I've had a tic that jerked my arm which they've seen as an act of aggression mot understanding the disorder at all. Being tasered by them because all they're hearing is threats of violence and my arm stuck in my pocket making a finger gun position pushing on the pocket making it look like I'm about to pull out a weapon. Being accused by parents of being a p#do because I've yelled something obscene about children.

I have ocd, bpd, gads and cptsd among other disorders that are being looked into, I get sent delusional by technology alot. Seems unrelated right? Until I'm stuck in a robotic alexa voice for hours on end sending me delusional making me think I'm a robot making the whole situation even more dangerous for other reasons and the stress just making it worse and worse. I struggle with flashbacks frequently and I can't tell you the amount of times a tic has sent me into one because its repeated a trigger or physically imitated one. The amount of times I've had a complete meltdown because I've been doing an ocd ritual (idk the right wording)and a tic has screwed it up (having to pump the soap bottle a certain amount of times, a tic screwing it up leading to me to have to do it over and over to the point of making my hands bleed from the rubbing which would have been avoided if it wasn't for the tic.) Or having to walk in a certain order and then having a tic jump meaning I have to redo the whole 10 minutes walk just to have it happen again.

But no, this is a fun disorder. It's so funny to watch. I want it, it's so cool, I can say whatever I want and get waya with it (when in fact, you certainly do NOT get away with it.) Let's record it because its so funny.

Yeah, sometimes there's funny moments. I sit and laugh with my partner when I'm ticking things like unicorn s#x, I've got a hammer, pow pow pow, whistling the Thomas the tank engine them song over and over again. Or when she tells me to shut up   and its followed by the most animalistic screech shes heard in my life. Being told  off for something and a tic simply replying no in the poshest accent you can think for a British kid from the far South with a northern twang. It can be funny when I'm just casually trying to eat and suddenly my face is one with the food. But its funny because I have to find the humour in it.

 it can be so severely debilitating. Even people with mild cases it's so humiliating at times at can put such a massive dent in your social life. It causes injuries and not all of them are temporary. I have permanent brain damage from tics permanent joint problems, permanent scars and markings. Not to mention the damage its done to me mentally.

Trying to call an ambulance for my mother who's had a stroke and is attacking me but hanging up because of a tic repeatedly making what should have been a 5 minute call 30 minutes. I was 16 and now I have to live with the guilt forever that if I hadn't of had that tic my mum would still be able to function like an adult and not like a 3 year old.

Being in a similar situation at 9 hanging up on my aunt I would have been able to say goodbye and maybe even have convinced her not to do what she was about to.

If I hadn't of had one single tic at 12 that hit my head i wouldn't have permanent brain damage and would still be able to take in information properly and focus on things.

Yes these things don't happen with everyone with tourettes, but its something that can and has happened to quite a few. This disorder has almost ruined my life. It's not for you to record. It's not for you to laugh at. It's not for your entertainment. It's not always just swearing and weird movements. In severe cases it can destroy your life in many ways. It makes you feel so alone, so helpess, your always in pain, your never fully in control and if the tics go it's never guarantee dtheyre not coming back.

I'm not a TV show to laugh at, I'm not a comedian, I'm not a toy, I'm not a zoo animal, I'm someone with a disorder that screws with me so much and constantly humiliates me. There's days where I can function normally with the tics, and I love those days of respite. Like any other disorder it has days where its not so bad yet its not taken seriously like others. I wish people saw how hard it actually can be to live with ts. Its not a joke

What we do know is that TS can negatively impact your life in so many ways, and for some people, it\'s just a background thing.

"I'm working on a video where I pitch a 4 season Animorphs Live action television show (Possibly Netflix, Hypothetically), here is my take on the pilot. I made a few changes, introduced some characters earlier, this is not a shot-for-shot remake of the invasion.","Episode 1

We open on Jake getting some guys to leave Tobias alone and then we get a scene of them eating lunch together. Tobias explains his shitty home life, character development, jake invites him to the mall with marco and Rachel, and he gets a text from Rachel asking if her friend Cassie can come, we see jake is a bit excited by this and he rushes to text yeah sure. That’s right, we’re setting this in the present day, look I would love a 90’s nostalgia trip, but lets be honest Netflix isn’t going to put up the money for that. And I have a few more scenes involving cellphones, and they’re gonna be bangers. We have the kids meet, hang out, get some interplay between them and Rachel kind of thinks Tobias is cute, Rachel’s going to be the most important character to pull off because you got to remember that while she is the stereotypical blonde bombshell cheerleader 90’s mall girl, she’s also a cold blooded near sociopath. 

The kids leave the mall, Tobias, and this is important that its Tobias, suggests cutting through the construction site, they go through, talk about the mall, spaceship crashes, meet elfangor, explain the plot, get the cube, horrifying Visser Three scene the kids run away. Jake gets home and his brother, Tom, asks where he’s been. 

“You seem a little on edge bro, everything okay,” 

“Yeah, just umm, I didn’t make the JV basketball team, I’m just kind of bummed about it, I just want to go bed”

“Yeah, hey it’s okay, You know I was almost cut when I was on JV, But you know I just really worked on myself, you can get them next year, I’ll take you out back and we can play some horse, help you pick up your game,”

“Sounds great, thanks,” Jake says before heading to bed.

The next day Jake is texting Marco, and when he brings up what they saw, Marco shuts him down and says he doesn’t want any record of that incident in text messages. Jake is interrupted by Tobias, who confesses he did it, he morphed. We get a flashback scene of a dying Red Tailed Hawk in his uncles back yard, his uncle wanted him to take a gun and put it out of its misery. Tobias acquired it, and then did the deed. “I flew man, I actually flew” we get an uplifting scene of Tobias finding peace and escape from his abusive home life (You’re probably going to figure this out eventually, but yes, Tobias is my favorite character) He shows jake how to Morph his dog, I want to say the name was Boomer? But jake morphs, hilarious comic relif scene of being naked. 

We have a scene at school and introduce Chapman, have him acting very suspicious, and The kids get together after school at the Gardens the next day and talk about what happened, Cassie mentions she tried to morph too, she also mentions she figured out how to keep clothes while morphing (Cassie is really good at morphing) they all get some animals and decide to investigate Chapman.

Jake and Marco morph Lizards (the iconic first cover) and follow chapman, discovering the entrance to the yerk pool and Tom’s status as a controller.

The kids assume they can just get some big stuff, go down there, mess up the pool (Marco”How big could it possibly be?”) free everyone, and then they can put all this alien invasion nonsense behind them.

Montage of getting the battle morphs, Rachel Elephant, Marco Gorilla, Cassie Wolf, and of course Jake gets his classic tiger, and its going to be an orange tiger, not a white tiger like the nickeloen show. They sneak in the school, go down into the pit. Jake is nervous as hell, but Marco reassures him, “Just a tiger bro, no big deal,”

And See that this is no rinky dink fly by night operation, the cavern extends further than they can see, like it goes over maybe half the city. We see scenes of the involuntary being caged, some being drugged, and the voluntary controllers just chilling out and having some bottled water while their yerk recharges. This is much worse than we thought, Jake, the leader, calls for them to get out of here before they’re found, Cassie the Compassionate says “maybe we can get some people out, they can get the word out about this place” Marco “Yeah maybe we could save some people, except I don’t have a death wish, I’m with fearless leader, Bail?” Bail. Jake looks to Rachel, and we see why Rachel is awesome, “I can turn into an elephant, I think we can take them, some of them,” and she starts morphing elephant, Tobias is with Rachel right away, “I’ll go hawk try to get an eye on how much fire power they have, I relay it to you guys, Tobias goes hawk and flies up giving a birds eye view of their area.

Rachel charges forward as an elephant and causes a rucus, “we can’t be seen here, might as well morph,” Goes tiger and joins rachel, Cassie, “Jake no! Jake!”, Marco, “Screw it, It’s morphin time,” Goes Gorillia. Rachel Jake and Marco start attacking Hork-bajir and Taxons using the information that Tobias is giving them this is the big action scene we’ll use that famous Netflix Pilot Budget on, Cassie, still human, rushes to a cage and tries to get it open, and she actually does, freeing about a dozen people and leading them out of the pool (this will be important later) They break a section of the pool and the Yerks pull back. With the coast clear they de-morph and get out rushing home.

Visser Three, in a blade ship hovering over “The Town” one of his minions, enters, “Sub-Visser-Fifty-One, what news for me,” he turns around, and we see a young attractive blond woman, attractive save for the horrendous burns on half her face, “Sir, It appears that Elfangor was not alone, there was attack on the pool in section 21, we believe it to be the work of Andilate Bandits, and I told you, We prefer to be called Taylor” (She is way too good of a character to use in only 2 episodes max, I think theres a lot of room here to expand her)

We go back to jakes house, a tense encounter with Tom, He says that Jake’s seemed pretty off since losing out on the JV team, and he heavily pressures Jake to come to this group he joined The Sharing, telling him how he felt lost,”I didn’t tell mom and dad this, but I was in a bad place for a minute, felt like he had nowhere to turn, but the Sharing, they really makes you feel like you belong to something bigger.”

In his room, a hawk comes to his window tapping it. “Tobias! You got out!”

“Kind of”

“What do you mean, did someone see you, did someone see us?”

“I think we’re good man, well you’re good, me though, I kind of got lost in the cavern, and it took a while for me to find a safe place to De-morph, and when I tried, well, I guess that alien wasn’t kidding about the two hours,” 

“So you’re,”

“yeah, this is me now,”

Somber music plays and we pan out to a starry night sky, (and maybe see a twinkle, a ship coming out of Z-Space perhaps, are the Andilites coming?)

I think you may be underestimating the nostalgia factor, too. Market demographics are changing to where people who were kids in the 90s (somewhat) have disposable incomes which can be capitalized on.\n\nIf this is a pitch for Netflix, I would lean heavy into the 90s aesthetic. After Stranger Things is over, they'd be looking for the next cultural phenomenon, and to *not* try to capitalize on that when we're talking about Animorphs would be a shame.\n\nOtherwise, I particularly like the idea of introducing Taylor this early.

"When I stepped foot in Norway, I understood how my parents felt when they first stepped foot in America.","I've traveled to 25 countries across 4 continents in addition a good number of the states in the US (my home). Yet, Norway was the only place in the world to make me fully realize that there is something better. It was the only place where I didn't meet a single person who complained about their life, because everywhere else I've been, people are open with criticisms of their own city/country. 

\- Here in California, EVs are common. But to see Teslas and other expensive EVs being used as taxis totally blew my mind. And I like how there's so little noise pollution, because of the high rate of EV adoption.

\- I loved how Oslo is so quiet and peaceful, and the streets are so serene. The air was so crisp and clean. 

\- I'm used to having to watch my back when I walk around LA and even in my own home. I have to shoo off homeless people trespassing on my front yard regularly. I have to stare down potential package thieves and possible burglars casing my home for a robbery. I'm honestly on edge half the time here. I'm on the phone every month with the police, reporting a violent situation, disturbance, homeless person trespassing or because somebody (like bus driver/stranger/etc) is flagging for help. At one point, I almost got NRA insurance for a gun defense attorney, just incase if I shot somebody in self defense. In Oslo, I felt so safe. I felt like I was in a dream where there was no danger and I was at complete peace staring out the window of my Airbnb at the trees outside. Simply existing in Oslo was a non-stop meditative experience, where my blood pressure dropped and I felt my childhood creativity coming back to me. Walking around, I only saw 2 homeless people the whole time, which completely blew my mind. 

\- Your city workers get remote controlled lawn mowers. I've never seen one in my life before and it was the coolest thing I've ever seen.

NFA Hotdog Roller,"Today on How It's Made: Automated glass bead blasting silencer rings and cores.

This thing has blasted thousands and thousands of parts reliably despite the incredibly harsh dry abrasive environment for the motion elements.

What I've Become: Chapter XIV,"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/a3877f/what_ive_become_prologue/) [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1716mu7/what_ive_become_chapter_xiii/)

Sergeant Casianon’s eyes swept over the two troopers, her heart falling as she took in the beleaguered state of what remained of Sergeant Inza’s team.  “Is there anything else you can tell me about what happened?”

""No, ma’am.  We’re just lucky we survived…”

Casianon and Verilo both shared a look before they turned back towards the two privates.  “Go get some rest, the others will finish packing up the base.  You’ve earned it, soldiers.”

“What do you think, Casi?  Not like the captain to send them in without better info,” Verilo asked as he watched the two privates wearily stumble towards *The Caliban*.

“I don’t know, Verilo.  This whole thing stinks to the Battlewatcher’s domain, but I can’t quite place the source of the stench,” Casianon said as she gently rubbed her mandibles.  “We certainly don’t have the whole picture, but that monster and its friends are going to pay for what it did to Inza.”

Verilo stared at the usually level-headed Casianon in surprise.  “I don’t think we should jump to conclusions so quickly, Casi.”

“What conclusions?” Casianon asked as she stood up and turned towards the other sergeant, her antennae vibrating with barely controlled rage as she snapped her mandibles together.  “Some alien scum and a crazed bio-weapon just killed Inza and his team!  As far as I’m concerned, that’s an open and shut case right there!”

“…If it was so crazy, then why did the birds come to the bio-weapon's defense?” Verilo asked calmly.

“They didn’t come to its defense.  They saw two alien species fighting, and jumped right in!” Casianon yelled as she punched a nearby tree.  It wasn’t a particularly thick tree, probably only a hand’s span in diameter, which meant that Casianon’s augmented punch was more than enough to break it in half, causing it to topple over in a very noisy display of power.

The show of force did nothing to cow Sergeant Verilo, though.  “Casi, you know that isn’t true.  You saw the footage.”

“Yeah… but it felt good blaming them for a few seconds…” Casianon said, trying to shake the stiffness the punch put into her hand.  “Hazalk’s got a lot of explaining to do once we get up there…”

Sergeant Verilo stared at her for a few seconds before he looked away.  “I’m more concerned about Ilisk.  From the sound of the recordings, it felt like the captain was being spoon-fed information as the situation played out.”

“The captain still shouldn’t have sent them in there…” Casianon said before slumping down onto the ground, her four legs splayed out in all directions as she leaned against *The Caliban*.  “He should have ordered them back, regardless of what Ilisk told him!”

“And go against his superior?  Hazalk’s played fast and loose with the rules before.  Even turned ‘traitor,’ but that was always because he had the upper hand when it came to information,” Verilo said, crossing both sets of arms.  “He wouldn’t disobey a direct order without a damn good reason, and he didn’t have that reason until *after* the damage had been done.”  Casianon didn’t answer, choosing to instead turn away from Verilo’s relentless assault.  Verilo wasn’t having any of it, though.  They were soldiers, not children, and she was acting enough of the part that Verilo was seriously doubting her ability to continue with the mission.  “Come on, Casi, this isn’t like you.  You know that-”

“Don’t you feel even remotely sad that he’s gone?” Casianon asked, interrupting Verilo and stopping him in his tracks.  As she turned to him, her antenna were flat against the sides of her head and tears streamed freely from her eyes, and Verilo found himself incredibly grateful that they had had the foresight to move out of sight of the other soldiers.  It would hurt their moral to see her like this.

*It would hurt their moral to see me like this too,* he thought, turning away from her accusing stare, trying desperately not to tear up himself.  “I do… but even though the mission has been scrubbed, we’re not honoring his memory by breaking down while in enemy territory.  Pull yourself together, we’re still not out of the woods yet, both figuratively, and literally.”

“Okay… I’ll… I’ll be there in a minute, just give me a little time to compose myself,” Casianon said, waving the other sergeant off as she got her legs back underneath her.

“You do that, but don’t let your guard down.  The natives can change how physics work, so we have no idea what they’ll do to us if they find us,” Verilo reminded her before he turned and left to presumably oversee the packing of the campsite, an assumption that was proven correct when Casianon’s ears picked up the sound of him noisily ordering his troops around.

She didn’t join him, though.  She was far too busy remembering all the good times with Inza, the way he would laugh in the mess hall… the way he would spar with the rookies in the training room…  The way his antennae would twitch, right after they had made love…

With a noisy, throaty sound, she tried to pull herself together, and succeeded for the most part, though the red around her eyes told an entirely different story.  It was hard for her to imagine a world without Inza, that last cycle they had spent together being just that: The last cycle they would spend together.

*I will have to make do, though.  I have to pull myself together, be strong for the troops.  It’s what Inza would have wanted,* she thought to herself as she wiped her face clean with the back of her sleeve.

With one last check to make sure that she hadn’t missed anything, she went back to help the others.  She kept her eye open for any natives, of course, but it turned out that Verilo’s warning was somewhat unneeded, as they were able to pack up and get into *The Caliban* without any further incident.  If anything, it sort of felt like the planet itself was letting them go, as glad to see them leave as they were to get away.

As she watched the forest fade and the planet grow smaller in her software’s uplink to the ship’s cameras, she couldn’t help but feel like this wasn’t the last time she would see this particular planet up close.  If anything, she felt like the planet was staring back at her, daring her to make the same mistake twice.

She ignored its taunting gaze, though, choosing to instead redirect her focus to the skies above and where, hopefully, she would find the one responsible for Inza’s death.

And heaven help whoever was responsible, because if she managed to get her hands around his neck, he was going to wish that she would just kill him.

""Come in,"" Ilisk heard Captain Hazalk say through the intercom.  A single button press later and the door opened, revealing the captain’s sitting room.  It was a decently sized office, containing a small, clean desk, a bookshelf with a number of old fashioned paper and ink books on it, as well as a liquor cabinet.  Above the captain’s desk hung the confederate flag, a series of ten green planets suspended in front of a black background, while the captain himself sat behind the desk, his hands folded in front of himself as he stared Ilisk down.

""You wanted to speak with me, Captain?"" Agent Ilisk asked as he entered the room.

""You mind telling me what Subject Thirty-Eight really is? Or did you want me to lose another six soldiers before you admit your mistake?"" Hazalk accused him in a perfectly level tone.

Ilisk shook his head at these words, his expression carefully constructed to only reveal a slight contempt towards the captain. ""You failed to capture it? I am extremely disappointed in you Captain, I was expecting-""

""When were you going to tell me that it was sapient? Or were you just hoping that I would look the other way as you attempted to sweep this whole thing under the rug?"" Hazalk interrupted, his tone still completely level.  “Somehow, I rather doubt that.  You’re only one krin, after all.  You *must* have expected someone to notice what was happening.  You’re too smart to not think of a contingency plan.”

This stopped Ilisk in his tracks.  The captain *was* right, he did have a contingency plan, he just hadn’t expected the captain to guess so much from a single encounter.  ""...I don't know what you're talking about.""

""Don't play coy with me, Ilisk.  Subject Thirty-Eight has shown ingenuity and cunning, a far cry from the ‘mindless terror weapon’ that you told me it was.  In addition to that, it has gained the support of the natives, uses tools, and can *talk.*  It is clearly more than just a monster that the Krin Science Team grew in a tank.  Unless, of course, it was designed to have sapience in the first place, which would be an entirely different, yet far more severe set of laws that they broke,"" Captain Hazalk said as he leaned a little closer, his antennae drooping dangerously.  “What was the plan, here?  Two of my soldiers have seen it in action.  They’ll have questions, they aren’t stupid, and more importantly, they would have told the others down there by now.  My troops will need to be kept quiet, as will I, for that matter.  In fact, you’re probably going to have to keep the whole *crew* quiet.  So tell me, what was the plan?  Are your pockets deep enough to cover *all* of us?”

Ilisk’s felt his heart leap at that.  *So the rumors are true… this will be easier than I expected,* he thought as he straightened his uniform a little.  “Captain, I never knew you were so *wise.*  I thought that the Hero of Thana couldn’t be bought..."" Ilisk said as he sat down in the chair across from Hazalk.

""My crew and I have always been open to the highest bidder.  Why do you think we switched sides during the war with the Quzin Theocracy soon after Thana?  We only *play* soldier with the new confederacy, to ensure a steady income.  However, if the tides are changing, then I and my men *can* be bought…” Hazalk leaned back, his antennae lowering slightly as he narrowed his eyes in a conspiratorial manner.  “Tell me, Ilisk.  Are the tides changing?  I think they are, if you and your people are willing to break the treaty with the quzin.”

Ilisk didn’t answer at first.  He wasn’t sure how much he should share, especially when he considered how easily the captain could be bought.  “And your men?  How are you going to keep them quiet?”

“My men follow *me.*  I’ve kept them alive, and they are loyal for that.  If I order it, they’ll keep their mandibles shut.  The only question is… can you pay enough to keep *my* mandibles shut?” Hazalk asked as he folded his arms in front of him.  “Whether or not you’re willing to admit it, you *need* me.  Whether it’s to sanitize the crash site, the recovery of Subject Thirty-Eight, or to keep this whole thing under wraps, and I think you already knew this, didn’t you?”

Ilisk just stared at the captain for what seemed like an eternity, before his antennae raised ever so slightly.  ""I had my suspicions, Captain.  After all, I did ask for your ship specifically for this mission.”  Ilisk stood up and began walking around the captain’s office before his eyes locked onto the small liquor cabinet that the captain kept.  “Do you mind?”

“Go right ahead,” the captain said, gesturing with a single hand.

Ilisk began unscrewing the cap of a bottle of Blue Theroz, anticipation clear on his face as he poured himself a glass.  “I’m authorized to pay you and your crew ten billion credits for the completion of the mission.”

Hazalk thought about this for a few seconds, before he leaned forward, a look of hunger in his eyes.  It was tempered by caution, however, and Ilisk got the distinct impression that the captain was *trying* to look level-headed.  “Twenty billion, *especially* if you want this creature alive,” Hazalk countered.

Ilisk winced inwardly, as that would most likely cut into his personal funds, but this was too important to leave to chance, *especially* since the captain wasn’t lying about how much pull he had with his crew.  Ilisk might have kept to himself for the majority of the trip, but he had listened in to quite a few of the conversations around the ship.  The captain wasn’t kidding when he had said that they were loyal to him specifically.  “Fifteen, and that’s the highest I can go.”

This seemed to please Hazalk, as he then nodded in satisfaction as he leaned back into his chair.  “I’m interested, but I want to know more about this thing, first.  Especially if we’re trying to catch it.”

Ilisk swirled the liquid in his cup for a few seconds, before he took a single sip.  He wasn’t idly doing this, however.  He was buying time, even going so far as to use his implants to accelerate his perception of time, letting him have plenty of breathing room to consider just how much he wanted to tell the captain, in case the captain and crew turned after taking the money, and spilled their guts before they could be properly sanitized.  He finally decided to settle on a half-truth.  “It’s very simple, Captain.  We found Subject Thirty-Eight and its fellows on a backwater, underdeveloped world, and modified them to be the perfect assassins.  They can slip into places that krin would have a hard time fitting, and their intelligence, despite their primitive society, can *not* be overstated.  Even when properly controlled with a mental regulator, Subject Thirty-Eight and its fellows would show an unbelievable level of ingenuity and creativity, making them the perfect soldiers, and in turn, the perfect weapons.""

""Were they ever tested?"" Hazalk asked slowly.

""Yes, and to great effect. They brutally slaughtered anything that would get in their way, and showed great competence in group tactics as well as solo stealth missions.  They were just about to finish their testing phase when disaster struck,” Ilisk said as he sat back down in front of the captain before placing his half consumed glass on the desk between them.

“Do you know what happened?""

“We do not.  *The Ascension* suddenly stopped checking in, and a few weeks later was when the confederacy picked up its distress signal.  On a guess, based on your team’s encounter with the thing, I would surmise that the entire stock developed a resistance to our control,"" Ilisk said as his eyes furrowed in frustration.  “I don’t know how they managed it, but if these things can wrest control from wires and computers placed directly into their brains, we need to know *how* they did it before we can execute our plan.”

Hazalk tapped a single leg on the deck, a thoughtful look on his face.  “I must admit, they are incredible assassins.  I reviewed the footage and I got the impression that, if your little experiment wanted to, it would have wiped my entire team in an instant.”

“Oh, it is quite capable of that, especially if it has backup.  But that’s not what they were made for,” Ilisk said, tapping the side of his beak in a conspiratorial fashion.

“And what were they made for, then?” Hazalk asked eagerly.  “Who was supposed to be the target of your assassins?”

“Ah ah ah, Captain, you know I can’t tell you that,” Ilisk said, shaking a single finger at him.  “All you need to worry about is getting the thing back on board.  A task that I’m sure you are more than a match for, for which you will be paid handsomely.”

Hazalk raised an antenna slightly.  “Is that all you can tell me?  Come now, I need to at *least* know who will be signing my checks.”

Ilisk just shook his head.  “You know that would be bad business sense, Captain.  My employer is very secretive, and would prefer to remain anonymous.”

Ilisk and Hazalk stared each other down, before the tension in the captain’s eyes relaxed, and his antennae fell in defeat.  “And here I was thinking I could get you to spill more.  But you did give me quite the morsel for High Command,” Hazalk said as he stood up and pulled his plasma pistol from his side holster.  “Agent Ilisk, you’re under arrest for treason, war crimes and conspiracy to commit murder.”

Ilisk felt a shock run through his spine as he stared down the barrel of the captain’s sidearm.  ""Wha- Captain, you're making a mistake.  I can make you *very* rich.  Besides, if I’m going down, so are you.  I know things about you that I know you’ve been trying to cover up.""

""Don't make me laugh, worm.  The hierarch is well aware of every detail of my past, and unlike you, I have his blessing,"" Hazalk said, his eyes hard and cold as he gestured towards the traitor, telling him with his gun to stand up.  “You were right when you spoke earlier.  I can’t be bought.  You probably should have listened to yourself.”

Ilisk eyed the gun as the implants in his head slowed time down to a crawl.  *The gun is in his lower left hand…*  Ilisk's top right hand shot out like a serpent, grabbing the captain’s weapon and twisting it to make the plasma bolt aimed at his chest miss.  The captain was too slow, too, and not nearly strong enough to stop the augmented agent.  Ilisk felt the captain’s hand break under his grip, and without a second thought, the agent yanked the gun out of the captain’s hand, turned it slightly, and placed it into the waiting palm of the agent’s other right hand, all while the hands on his other side shot forward, shoving the captain away from his desk.

There was a brief moment where Ilisk got to see the captain’s expression of fear and shock, during which Ilisk allowed himself a few seconds to savor the moment.  “You should have taken my deal,” he said, right before firing a round into the captain’s chest.

The captain must have been wearing a protective vest underneath his suit, because instead of vaporizing half his chest and killing him instantly, the captain merely fell backwards with a grunt of pain as a large, nasty burn appeared on his chest.  Ilisk almost felt glad that the captain had been so prepared, and casually picked up his glass again before finishing it in one gulp, his stolen plasma pistol still trained on the prone captain.  “Your crew might be loyal, but the common soldier is quite stupid.  How much do you think it would take to paint *you* as a traitor?  Because quite honestly, I don’t think it would take *too* much convincing to turn those rubes against a corpse…” Ilisk said as he worked his way around the desk.  Before he could take two steps, though, the door behind him opened, causing him to turn in surprise.

Standing at the door were two soldiers in full body armor, rifles at the ready.  “Troopers, you’re just in time. Take this treacherous swine down to the brig,” Ilisk said, turning back to the captain, his pistol trained on the downed krin’s form.  “He was trying to-”

Before Ilisk could finish selling the guards his lies, however, he felt something cold and hard impact the back of his head, while a strong, clearly augmented hand grabbed Ilisk’s gun hand, making the agent’s final shot go wide, melting a part of the ship’s bulkhead.

""The only traitor here... is you, Ilisk,"" Captain Hazalk said with a gasp. ""Did you really think I would confront you without a contingency plan? The whole ship heard you confess *and* shoot me. Take him away, and get medical up here as soon as possible, my vest failed somewhat when the scum shot me.""

Ilisk shot the captain a nasty look as cuffs were placed on his hands, but at the moment, there was very little else that was all he could do.  *If it’s the last thing I’ll do, I’ll kill you for this, Hazalk,* Ilisk thought as he was dragged out in chains.

The digital copies are only a few bucks, but I'd understand it if you couldn't pitch in.  Still, if you could tell others about it, that would be fantastic.  It's not about the money for me, since I fully intend to eventually release this story and its characters into the public domain in my life.  It's always been about inspiring others, but given that life costs money, and I have three kids to take care of, I can't exactly devote my life to this one thing.

"Behold, my Jurassic World Dominion rewrite","Okay, first off, I like Dominion. Just like it. It’s cool to see my boys and girl back in action for once, and there's plenty of cool dinosaur stuff in there as well. But I admit, I don‘t really know if I like the locust plot myself, but I guess it’s just... Okay.

I guess the other screenwriter he worked with, Emily Carmichael, wasn’t a good decision either.

She wrote the Pacific Rim sequel, which was... Just no.

Other than that, please just stop. 

But it isn’t like I had no issues with the movie.

1. Not enough dinosaurs
2. Locusts
3. Ramsay Cole being underutilized
4. The one part with the Pyroraptor
5. The entirety of the final battle
6. Blue being underutilized
7. Only one good “horror” moment, but that’s it
8. Rexy being used as a punching bag when she deserves way better
9. The Atrociraptors being used for literally one scene, which is my favorite in the whole movie
10. WHERE THE ***FUCK*** IS THE SPINOSAURUS

So, I’ve decided to try and rewrite the story, to try and make it longer and, if not make it better, vastly improve many scenes in it.

How about we get started?

The beginning would open with the prologue that was released on YouTube, which SHOULD have been in the movie in the first place, but hey, it’s Universal, what do you expect?

After the 65 million years ago segment, it actually would give us a recap of all of the movies, using old footage from each one of them, all the way until Fallen Kingdom. But before the theater parking lot scene, we would get a scene that takes place right after Fallen Kingdom, with dinosaurs appearing in the world for the first time and creating chaos. It would be a montage of different people encountering different types of dinosaurs, and even some of the DinoTracker website footage would be useful here.

Then the scene at the theater parking lot would commence, then... TITLE SCREEN.

After that, the actual opening of the movie would begin, the Mosasaur attack, except it would be taking parallels from the deleted whaling boat scene from Fallen Kingdom. Then we would get the news segment which... It isn’t even that terrible. You guys are overexaggerating.

Then we cut back to Owen and his group on horses running after the Parasaur’s. This scene would basically be the same, but we see that after Owen uses his magic hand with the dino, he puts it inside of a safe cage in a truck.

He shares a moment by touching it’s snout, then it drives away.

Owen gets in his truck and drives toward his cabin in the mountains, and there would be a scene of him staring out the window over the valley, watching dino’s peacefully frolicking in the snowy forest, while an old 60s song plays in the background. Over The Mountain by Bobby Vinton to be exact.

Now, instead of Maisie being curious about Charlotte Lockwood, I would have her in an internal conflict about being the sole reason why dinosaurs are around the world in the first place. She a deep connection with them as she’s also a clone of a previous version of something else, but also she’s starting to see the fact that since she’s released the dinosaur’s around the world, they are wildly fucking everything up.

Other than that, It plays out the same from here.

Instead of the Locusts killing off all the crops so cattle can’t eat and crops can’t grow like in the movie, it’s all deliberate attacks on small farms and businesses. Even towns.

In this version, Biosyn is actually one of the top companies that host the dinosaur black market, releasing a rabies-type disease towards any animal or dinosaur near any small town or farm in patterned attacks, then they take the dinosaurs before the disease gets any worse and bring them back to the facility in which they use them for very unethical experiments.

I got this idea from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/w0ny99/i_still_dont_get_it_why_locusts/) on the Jurassic Park Reddit.

An infected Parasaurolophus chases after the two kids, replacing the Locusts. I’m going back and forth between if I want to kill the kids or keep them alive.

This is where Ellie and her students step in, and she finds the now dying infected Para inside the barn, stabbed in the side by a shovel. She tries to comfort it while it tries to weakly bite her. It would be a grotesque but sad scene. 

Ellie, instead of just taking a Locust like in the movie, takes a sample of the rabies and takes it with her.

This is where Alan Grant is introduced, where he actually meets a Compy before he meets Ellie. It’s the same reunion scene up until Ellie shows him the rabies sample. She believes that all of the rabies attacks are connected, and that Biosyn has something to do with it, and she’s suspicious about Biosyn taking all the dinosaurs.

The whole kidnapping thing would be different. Instead of just Maisie and Beta being kidnapped, Blue also gets taken as well.

After this, they go to Biosyn with Ramsay, and it’s pretty much the same.

The introduction to the Giga is vastly different. They’re more malnourished and skinny-looking, with scars along its body, and marks specifically around its neck. Overall, much more abused-looking. It’s tearing apart the carcass of a dead sauropod, before eyeing up at the helicopter and snarling.

The part where Ian confirms Ellie’s suspicions would be the same, but now because of rabies and some shady things they do with the dinosaurs.

It plays out the same from here.

I would change the scene with Kayla being introduced for the first time. After she sees Maisie, she goes over to Sonoya and questions her. She would even try to take her away, but a guard stops her. She would watch as Sonoya drives away.

It plays out the exact same from here.

IT’S ATROCIN’ TIME!

The scene would be a bit different in the movie, with Claire being the first one to encounter the Atrociraptors, and Owen having to divert them away from her so that Kayla and Claire get inside the truck and get chased by another. Blue also jumps across rooftops and takes on one of the Atrociraptor’s chasing Owen, fighting and killing it by throwing it down into a deep pit.

Barry would also have a moment to shine, where he goes on a one-on-one fight with one of the Atrociraptors and ends up killing it by filling it with lead.

Owen would get cornered, but he would do some James Bond-type shit like always and get out just in the nick of time and onto Kayla’s plane.

Blue would try to get to the plane, but Biosyn officials catch up and trank her.

It plays out the same from here.

When Maisie is talking with Dr. Wu, he doesn’t show her that weird impreg clone thingamajig video, but he explains his motives. In his words:  


**“**When I made the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, I... I saw myself as some sort of god. Bringing back species millions of years old. Could you blame me? I denied every single bit of criticism, because I thought all they wanted was to try to kill everything I’ve done when I researched their DNA. I thought they were wrong. I made all of the dinosaur’s female, so that none of them could breed... But one of them did. A raptor. They were able to change their gender and interbreed by using the frog DNA in their genetic code. And then the park failed, and all my work was halted. All of it gone. Destroyed. And I was left for nothing. For years. I tried to collect the pieces, but with InGen taking control away from Hammond, I wasn't able to get to him. I thought everything I had done was gone, but... Then Jurassic World came. Masrani bought InGen and started to build a new park, with all the dinosaurs from the previous. And he managed to hire me back. I was mistakenly ecstatic. I started resuming my work, with newly advanced technology. I brought back new dinosaurs, until I came up with the idea of a hybrid.”

“The Indoraptor...”

“Yes, but that came after.”

“After? What came before?”

“The Indominus Rex.”

It was compiled of many different dinosaurs’ DNA. It was meant to catch the public’s eye, because they were starting to get bored of dinosaurs. Masrani kept insisting he wanted more teeth. *\[Chuckles\]* If only he knew... Then, it broke out. And one of the general’s tried to use the raptors to subdue it... But the Indominus used them against us. I was escorted off the island, and the park was closed down. Years later, I found Lockwood Manor... Then along came the Indoraptor... And I guess you already know the rest.

“Yeah... But why are you telling me all this?”

“Because of what happened that night and the chaos the dinosaurs are now causing around the world, it’s made me rethink everything. Then it hit me all at once... There is no such thing as control. There is no such thing as containment. Nature is always superior to humanity, regardless of the kind of advancements we make. I thought I could control the dinosaurs by changing their DNA, but they found a loophole. They thought they could control the Indominus and the Indoraptor, but they broke out. Control is only a myth. But nobody ever learns... But I did. And I need you so I can fix a terrible mistake that I’ve made. I know this might conflict with your mindset or morality, Maisie, but, please... I need you to hear this... With yours, Blue’s, and Beta’s DNA, I can finally be able to give all of us a chance against them. The dinosaur’s are destroying everything, so I need this DNA to be able to advance the rabies furthermore... And make it only infect them. In order for us to have a chance... the dinosaurs must die.”

This would conflict with Maisie’s point of view, so now she has an actual reason to escape, since she loves the dinosaurs.

Back with Alan and Ellie.

Instead of the Locust plot, they find cages upon cages of infected dinosaurs with the rabies virus. They are being used as tests against normal animals, such as a baby Triceratops eating a pig alive. There are many other tests other than the rabies. Very controversial tests for normal animals. They even find a document video back in 2020, showing the BioSyn staff mistressing the Giga severely when it was a juvenile, eventually leading to it killing and maiming another one of its kind in the wild.

They accidentally let out an infected baby Allosaurus, replacing the Locusts. They barely manage to make it out in time and lock the door.

Then they meet Maisie, and the rest would be the same.

The scene with the Quetzalcoatlus would be the same but slightly altered with the pterosaur digging out the top of the roof to get to them. After that, Claire opens the parachute and Owen and Kayla crash into the ice like in the movie.

We would get that same scene with the Therizinosaurus, but extended a bit longer for more tension and scares.

Owen and Kayla have the encounter with the Pyroraptor, just without the dino diving under the ice. Even I think that’s stupid.

They manage to get away, then we cut back to Claire. Here, we would cut back and forth between Owen and Kayla and Claire, with their own separate experiences with dinosaurs.

Claire finds a group of soldiers in the middle of a small clearing with another group of Parasaur’s, where they are using the same technology Mantah Corp uses and freezes them in their place, except for the babies. They all hoard the babies into small cages forcefully, except for one little guy who keeps running away. Before they could capture it, the Giga bursts from the treeline, chomping onto the baby and throwing it away. It then starts to brutally slaughter each and every single one of the soldiers, not even bothering to eat most of them, but just to kill.

After it ends its killing spree, it investigates the Para’s that are still standing frozen. It chomps down on one of the Para’s heads and rips it off, the others completely helpless to aid their buddy. It walks off into the forest.

But one of the soldiers is still alive, quietly trying to crawl over to the lake. The Giga comes out of the treelines again and silently watches him as it begins to approach. Just as he gets to the lake, it stomps on his back, trapping him in place. It sniffs him before biting its head off and throwing it away and nudging his body into the river.

Claire accidentally steps on a twig, making it snap, which draw’s the Giga’s attention. This all leads into an extremely intense chase scene through the valley, Claire managing to narrowly escape by weaving through trees and hiding inside of a log.

Owen and Kayla make their way through the jungle, and a scene just like the Giga and Rexy scene plays out but very different. This time, a red and striped Therizinosaurus walks out and starts feasting on the leaves, before getting taken off guard by a Giga rushing into it. It leads into a brutal and animalistic battle, before ending with the Giga slicing its neck open and ripping its head off

Back with Alan, Ellie, and Maisie. Instead of being dropped off at the Dimetrodon caves, they actually get dropped off in an area with an elevator, which they take up into the jungle. 

Here, they encounter a Pyroraptor nest, and Maisie manages to break one of them. They hide behind a log as one of them comes back to investigate the noise. They are eventually caught and flee, but get surrounded. They are ready to fight, but they hear the sound of something big. The Pyro’s run away.

The Spinosaurus breaks out of the treeline and a chase scene begins. The only way they get away is hiding inside a small cave and the Spinosaurus having a brief fight with the Giga and being scared off, one of the top spine bones getting snapped..

Eventually, Ian would meet up with Alan, Ellie, and Maisie, and they all get inside the Jeep and drive away.

Back with Lewis, he finds out about what happened inside of the lab, so, instead of setting fire to the Locusts like in the movie, he gets people to go inside and kill all of the dinosaurs. But they get killed by the baby Allosaurus, which accidentally manages to create a fire outside the facility through the pipes and vents. He goes inside a secret laboratory of his and presses a button, which releases MORE Atrociraptors. He sends them after both groups.

At the tower in the woods, Alan, Ellie, Ian, and Maisie finally get to meet with Owen, Claire, and Kayla. I would throw in a little easter egg about Owen saying that he remembers the lecture Alan told him about raptors, thus finally proving Owen to be the same annoying digsite kid from the first Jurassic Park.

But, instead of the Giga coming for them, the new pack of Atrociraptors manage to find them, and they are forced to try and fend them off, exactly like the scene from Lost World.

Before the raptors could get a chance to kill them, Ian manages to get inside of the Jeep and drive around, running over most of the raptors, and scaring the last one away.

They all celebrate their victory... Which gets short-lived once the GIGANOTOSAURUS finally comes.

The original scene in the movie with the Giga was actually pretty cool and scary, but also pretty disappointing. All the Giga did was just waltz around while the main characters ran toward the tower. In this, it would be an almost exact replica of the T-Rex Breakout scene from the original. And, yet again, Ian saves the day by lighting a stick thing on fire and diverting the Giga away, then throwing the stick into its mouth.

The Giga would try and chase them through the tower and they divert it away just like the original.

It would play out the same from here.

Back at Biosyn, Ramsay would meet up with Dr. Wu, who now has guards all over the room. Ramsay starts talking to him in whisper about how he can right his wrongs from the past. It takes a bit of convincing, but Dr. Wu gives him the watch-key and he unlocks Blue’s cage.

There would be a brief fight between Ramsay and Blue and the guards. After that, Blue would try and attack Ramsay, but Dr. Wu grabs a tranquilizer gun and shoots Blue, immediately knocking her out. They put her on a gurney and start sneaking through the facility quietly.

The whole scene with Claire and Ellie getting inside the server room would be about the same, except with no dead Locusts. But at the end, around the corner comes out the last surviving Atrociraptor, and it would end up chasing them around.

Due to the power of plot armor, even though they would get injured during the chase/fight, they manage to scare off the Atrociraptor once again.

(I was gonna have Blue intervene and have a fight with the Atrociraptor, but I decided that it didn’t make any sense)

After that, the whole scene of retrieving Beta plays, and it’s basically the same. But after they get back up in the control room, Ramsay and Dr. Wu come in this time, still carrying Blue on the gurney. Ramsay manages to convince everyone that Wu is on their side instead of Maisie.

After this, Kayla would try and land the helicopter in the facility, but realizes that dinosaurs are everywhere inside now. The two groups get inside of the middle and try to get to the helicopter, but get stopped once the Giga knocks over a pillar, almost crushing them.

Before the Giga could kill them, guess who comes by to save the day? Rexy!

The final battle begins! Except this time, Rexy has WAY more of a fighting strat than just being beaten down constantly, she actually puts up more of a fair fight, no Therizinosaurus included. At one point, she almost gets killed once she’s knocked over, but she quickly gets up and rips off both of the Giga’s arms before finally killing it by snapping it’s neck.

Lewis would try to escape the facility but would get cornered by a pack of Dilophosaur’s. It would be a bigger callback to Nedry’s death with an even more brutal death, almost exactly like the scene from the Micheal Crichton book.

The ending would be pretty much the same, but after the Blue and Beta reunion ending where John Hammond narrates the “see and touch” quote while a montage of dinosaurs being dinosaurs all around the world would play.

Right before the credits, we see Rexy peacefully living with the Buck and Doe Rex, who has had one or two new babies. Rexy would hunt down an Apatosaurus, but then a challenger approaches... THE SPINOSAURUS!

The rematch of the century would commence, and Rexy would absolutely body the Spino, being much more accurate with how the fight would really go. Rexy would win the battle, where they go their separate ways, but not before the Spino steals a small bit of the carcass.

She would walk away, toward the carcass of the Apatosaurus, put her foot on top of it, and roar as the sun sets over her new kingdom.

Credits.

A Glass of LiberTEA - Weavis's Encounter with the Hellkickers of Leirn,">IDK man I wrote this when I was drunk. It has been edited down to be so shit it's good. Have fun, don't take it too seriously ect ect.

**Memory transcription subject: Weavis, Gojid Anti-Air Specialist**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: September 27th, 2136*

They’d come at us with the fury and cunning above and beyond the Arxur. The human fleet in orbit above, dropping troops from the sky like it was nothing. Three long days of fighting, we’d lost the capital. We’d lost key starports. We’d lost cities. Of course, the humans were too few in number to occupy our world.

Our counter attacks into their strong-points yielded little results though, they were liberal with their artillery pieces, and we- well we didn’t want to bomb our own cities.

If that hadn’t been bad enough though, hundreds of Arxur cattle ships had began dropping from the sky not hours ago. Me and my crew were still holding steady on Hill 442. Anti-matter dropping around us, we refused to move... Mostly because if we did it’d mean going down into the woodlands, plains, orchards, and settlements around that were being hunted through by Human and Arxur alike. Their sick rivalry to see who could decimate my home planet the worst.

I swivelled the anti-air gun to bear on an incoming ship flying low thousands of meters out. “Eyes up, we’ve got incoming.” I managed. Using the digitally magnified computer screen line up with the ship annnndd... I pulled the trigger, the ground to air coilgun firing off a spread of four solid ordinance. I gave a quiet grunt of approval as I saw the cattle ship go up in flames as one projectile caught the engine, and the other slammed right through the middle. A couple seconds later the falling slag heap exploding as its fuel ignited. “Scratch one!”

To which my crew mate did just that. Scratching one mark into the tally of two dozen we’d cropped since the invasion began.

My communications squad mate piped up. “Weavis! We’ve got incoming signals from command. T-there’s an unknown fleet on sensors appearing in the hundreds!”

I swivelled my head. “Anything else? Anything to tell us what’s-”

Suddenly her hand radio blasted loudly with noise. The thicky accented voice of a **primitive** Yotul!? **“Greetings, Citizens of the Gojid Union. Your SOS signal had been picked up, and the Hellkickers of Super Leirn have answered. You will be liberated under the flag of Managed Technocracy! Please do not resist!”**

They must have been playing that thing on every single signal frequency they had on the database. “Shut that racket off!” I’d heard of the Yotul and their... Rather sudden uprising against the Federation planted administration on Leirn a few weeks ago, but how did they already have a fleet!? What was a hellkicker?

My operator went to switch it off, and the signal fizzled out. “Useless spehing primitives are going to get themselves killed, what did they mean by not resisting even?” I asked outloud.

“Incoming!” I swivelled the anti-air gun to face toward the pointed direction by my spotter, his sensor suite and viewing screen settled in front of him.

“I’m getting an ID on-” My viewing eye blinked. Spines raising on my back. “W-what the-” Before my eye I was looking at what appeared to be a hunk of metal breaking atmosphere. That wasn’t the odd part, not the part it might be mistaken for debris, not even the fact it was on fire as it fell, it was the fact there were four of them and all of them appeared to be in a controlled fall. “What are those things-” They sported neither UN or Arxur markings that I could see. “Comms, can we get confirmation on incoming as targets?”

I heard the communications switch back on again, only for the same voice from before to still be broadcasting. “**-liberty! The predators will be purged as the stain they are, baptized in the peroxide of victory!-**” It was swapped off again. My operator giving a no can do look. “They’ve got us jammed.”

By then? It was too late to target, they were making planetfall. With four hollow clunks only a short jog away. I got up and out of my gunnery seat. “D-defensive positions.” I managed, grabbing at my gun while the other three on my crew squared our rifles up on the sandbag perimeter ringing our anti-air den. Before my eyes I watched in broad daylight as... Four black carapace armour clad figures rose from the portions of the pods that had impacted themselves into our soil. Each was masked, with tinted visors, and varying handheld weapons.

Almost immediately all of them were tapping their gloved digits into their wrist devices. Spouting out nonsense as they threw little bulbous signallers.

\-”Deploying heavy ordinance!”

\-”This is it, this is what we’re made for!”

\-”Droppin a weapons package!”

The fourth on the ground who I presumed to be their leader because they had EXTRA yellow stripes on their uniform appeared to be bigger, and bulkier than the rest. Standing at the higher average for a Gojid even! Which- was not normal. Maybe this squad leader was a- No. I could see that armoured tail behind him. They were a Yotul. “H-hey. Are you here to help? We’ve got confirmed Arxur positions down in the settlement-” I raised a clawed finger, pointing down to a medium sized village, enshrouded in a simple earthwork wall that had been blasted to bits in places where hunt squads had used HE shells to get through.

Now that the leader was up closer in talking distance, I could **hear** why he was tall. It was a powered armour suit of some sort! He wasn’t just ‘that tall’ he was- in a servo-assisted battle suit of some sort?! Oh no, I could hear the garbled voice through his vocalization microphone. “Walk a mile in the paws of a patriot, and you’ll find the fountain of Libertea. Take the train, and you’ll find freedom.”

“Excuse me what? What’s a mile?” I asked, but he was already throwing one of those glowing bulbs on the ground. Already I could see more rocketing pods from the initial ones. Deliveries of- was that a flamethrower? A chained grenade launcher? **An automatic mortar?** The latter almost immediately started firing off toward the settlement I’d pointed out. “No! There might be people in there!” I stood up, my squad staying behind the bags as I vaulted over to talk down the insane ‘hellkickers’.

Alas. A firm, servo powered arm shoved me down and- right out of the way of the biggest pod I’d seen yet landing mere clawlengths from my body. A massive steel machine- its protective shell retracting to reveal- “You- you stupid primitives are you serious!?”

Their squad was mounting into the thing, an audible **CHOOO CHOOOOOOOO** coming from the bowels of the steam powered birtha. “Orbital train delivery confirmed command! We’ll need tracks! Liberating locals and commencing search and capture of target.” With his paw lowering from his communications button on the side of his helmet. The power armored atavist held out a paw for me. “You, citizen of Super Leirn. Volunteer to fight, come with us.”

I stared at him, flabbergasted at the request. “You’re jamming our communications-”

The Yotul tore at his facial covering, leaving his mouth open to see, its brown fur plain in the Cradle’s sun. One of his squad mates holding a shimmering yellow flag on a long pole behind him. “Tactical banner deploying!” Came the holler from them. The power armored Yotul’s chin was- chiselled! The way he jutted his head up in a proud bravado- the emblazoned sun design on the flag. Above the symbology “For Super Leirn!” and below it a “Ralchi’s Finest!” It was too much.

I felt my mind bending to their propagandized will. It was like my own rational thoughts were being subsumed. I tried to resist but- but- “**Lets show those socialist greys who’s boss!**” It was my own voice.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I flashed back to some level of rational mind what must have been only minutes later. I had a revolver in my paw, a bandoleer of spare ammunition and- “What are these?” I poked at my snout.

“Aviators, fellow Technocrat. They protect your eyes from nuclear fallout.” Came the voice of the hellkicker next to me. Wait- where was I!?

I looked around, and my spines bristled as I realized we were on that blasted train! The loud engine puffing white steam clouds over the open topped compartment we were in behind the engine car. Ahead of us I could see one after the other of prefabricated orbitally dropped track lines to keep it on course. We were mere moments from coming up on the settlement. “Wait! We’ll hit the wall!”

But already, our brave squad leader, the battle banner now affixed to his back like a leader pole raised his left powered arm, the autocannon- where had that come from exactly? The sky? The sky probably. He let loose half a dozen shells into the wall, turning the clay brick fixture to rubble, and just in time for it to reveal Arxur inside, who appeared to be mid-way through capturing dozens of my kind in a ringed loop of caging erected in the middle of town. I seethed in anger, and then- blinked as a splattering of red blood washed from the foremost Arxur as it was obliterated by a train track from above.

In my shock, I almost didn’t notice how quickly we’d come to a stop on account of rockets affixed to the front of the train firing off to kill our momentum. Throwing me a bit forward and into one of my fellow patriots. “W-what’s the plan!?” I yelled over the noise of the screeching metal as we slowed. “I can’t see a damn thing through these ‘aviators’!”

But my commander simply smirked. Nodding his head in silent, charismatic vigour. It was as if I could hear the bells of Super Leirn’s Constitution Hall bellowing their chimes through my veins. The wordless communication from the Yotul was clear. I didn’t need to see to kill. I didn’t need a plan.

“We do have a plan.” Came the voice of my commander. Oh. Maybe I didn’t read him all that well after all. “We must locate the human predator Marcel and detain him. The galaxy’s fate depends on it.”

“W-why!?” I felt myself asking, what could one of those even more primitive disgusting predators do that’d make them to sought after by this ELITE fighting force. Which- I noticed now the three others were currently in a pitched firefight with the Arxur.

The Yotul’s head snapped toward me. “If he’s allowed to continue his shenanigans we’ll be living in the **worst** timeline, with lame scholars and super nerds arguing over if shooting a Kolshian POW in the back of the head is ‘ethical.’ I’ll tell you what’s ethical, citizen Weavis. The question isn’t IF you should shoot a POW, it’s how many bullets will it take to liberate his soul from the iron grip of socialism.” He grasped his paw tight in a fist of **liberating** strength. The diametric symbology, so deep! “He’s also a nark.”

And then? He charged out of the train, his arm mounted auto-cannon thundering with shot after shot, tearing through grey and building alike. “For The Technocracy! For Super Leirn!”

I hopped out myself, paws hitting the ground and revolver in paw as I rushed toward the pen. Out of the corner of my eye I could see the namesake of one of the hellkickers, the yotul hopping to the height of an Arxur’s head and throwing out their leg in a practiced, precision strike. To my amazement, the squared apparatus I once thought was some sort of armour affixed by their toes instead made a thundering noise as it unleashed shotgun lead point blank with the hit.

They had- shotguns mounted on their legs. I wanted to be sick at the gore, but- for some reason all I could feel was the inspiration their uniforms exuded. “Kickass.” Even as one of them was caught by a stray friendly shell from that autocannon, blasting their leg until it was only loosely attached by flesh. “My leg! For the love of liberty my leeeeeeegg!” I could hardly believe my eyes. How could anyone- anything fight like this!?

In a moment I saw one of their teammate dive prone next to their injured comrade. “Got a stim!” Before jamming it into said leg and- I blinked. No- no. I’m not even going to process how that injured Yotul was standing as if nothing happened. I just let my paws keep pounding the gravel.

Finally, I reached the dome-like pen that held many of the inhabitants captured for cattle. Raising the revolver to the electronic lock and blasting it, the power of the shot cleaning the lock off and leaving the door to swing open. “To the train!” I yelled. Waving a guiding paw. And so, they did.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It’d been an hour since I’d volunteered to fight with the... uplifts turned fighting machines. The hellkickers were truly a sight to behold. I could see their ships overhead; some having flown within atmosphere. Massive solar-sails adorned along their hulls, and stylized of thick painted steel in shapes that resembled their own sailing ships made up their craftsmanship. I’d been informed it was the ‘Technocracy’s finest’ in interstellar propulsion. The orbital bombardment from the Arxur had been halted by now, and I was told that the Cradle’s casualties weren’t... as catastrophic as they could have been. More than half our population was still intact. We owed these creatures our lives.

My voice found me, even as the wind caught in my head fur from our position in the crows nest of the train engine’s upper deck. Our back compartments filled to the brim with my people awaiting evacuation. We’d hit three other Arxur targets of opportunity on our trip here. “So this Marcel predator. How do you know about what he’ll do in the future? And... Why would we be shooting Kolshians?”

The Kickleader’s tail lashed lightly in agitation just thinking about the dreaded hell being. “Five years ago, Leirn’s underground resistance received a packet from an alternative reality from our own. They gave us technology, but they also informed us of the single, one biggest threat to our timeline. This human Marcel. As for shooting Kolshians-” He dramatically rubbed his chin, more of his silent charisma exuding from his protector-crafted architecture of a physique. He embodied... Freedom. “They’re Tyrants.”

Even with no evidence presented, I took what the Yotul had said as gospel. I affirmed I was listening with an ear flick. “And you’re sure he’ll be at the human evacuation point?”

“Sure as justice.” I had no idea how sure justice was but alright-

“Anything else I should know about him?” I asked, almost dreading our final showdown. Allegedly, if we eliminated this human, the Yotul Technocracy would do the rest in saving the Cradle. In ‘setting the galaxy right’ which would have worried me, if it weren’t for how well they’d broken my mind’s will to question them. They had neat uniforms!

“If he tries to make you read a book labelled Frankenstein, do **not.** It’s a memetic hazard that’ll turn you into a grass eating communist, or an assassin, or both.”

... Uh... “I eat grass.”

“Me too.”

“Alright.”

I shook my head. Whatever. I set my monocular eyes forward, sternly glaring at the quickly upcoming starport that’d been retooled as a landing point for UN-labelled landers.

I could see the soldiers forming a wall of guns in anticipation of our arrival. Portable launchers aimed at our train. “A-are the human predators still hostile? I thought you’d reached an accord with them until the Arxur were gone?”

“He knows...” Came the murmur from my commander. As we drew closer, I could see portable launchers raised to fire at our bastion. And so, it was stopped short. The four Yotul exiting off the train with me at their side as we approached toward the gathered squads of humans. I counted... maybe twenty of the apes? Even with our ordinance we’d be hard pressed to beat so many of them. “Commander-”

“Fear not citizen!” He flicked his tail to signal me to stand back. His voice booming as he grabbed the flag from the back of his armour, slamming the bottom of the pole into the dirt. “We’ve come for Moawsle Fraser, Slanek, and Nulia. By order of Supreme Hellkicker Onso.”

“No, fuck off ya nutsack.” The commander pursed his lips, he’d... not expected that answer I suspect. Did his charisma not work on humans?

“We have you surrounded.” A deception!? We didn’t have them surrounded, but if they believed we did- What a clever ruse by these Super Leirn-

“No you don’t.”

“Human- you better take this seriously, we-”

“You can’t have them.”

“We’ll be willing to accept you as citizens of-”

“You’re an oversized hamster.”

The commander was beyond words now, I could feel it. We’d expended all diplomatic options with these apes, these… “Are they socialists?” I asked, since- honestly I didn’t understand half the speh coming out of these primitive turned saviour mouths.

“No citizen Weavis. They’re-” Unfortunately before he could finish whatever it was he’d been saying: gunfire broke out between our two parties. Dozens of human rifles barking in short order as they placed well aimed shot after well aimed shot into my companions. I dove into a blasthole left in some past bombardment.

My nerves frayed, and my courage waning as I heard the screams of my dying comrades. But then- a loud speaker began playing from the direction I’d last seen the commander.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5hCkh2AH58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5hCkh2AH58)

“Calling reinforcements!” Came the call. He’d... survived!? I popped my head over the lip of my cover to see. Sure enough! The commander had replaced his faceplate, bullets tinking off his powered armour, sleek plates of sturdy alloy painlessly deflecting the jacketed rounds. One human specialist kneeling with one of those portable launchers I’d seen. But- before he could steady and fire a landing pod slammed down on top of him. A crash of thunder as three more landed amid the now disoriented predators.

“What do we say to death hellkickers!?” As the commander dropped his arm that’d been shielding his visor from being hit. Sending pounding, thunderous autocannon fire into the ranks of humans. I could see among the four... new hellkickers? They’d called in more than just weapons. Where red orbs fell, searing orbital bombardments followed. Automated minigun turrets rising from pods and beginning to spray into the human perimeter. All at once I could see that dozens more humans were emerging from other parts of the base to try and contain the assault. Only to be kicked, shot, maimed- Protector preserve me.

A resounding call back at our commander’s question came from Yotul fighters. “Not today!” I got to my paws and ran toward the installation. If what they said was true, I had to put down this Marcel character. Personally. The Gojid Union’s fate counted on it. One of them speaking up again. “Well, mostly not today!” Her tail flicking to the three dead comrades who’d initially fallen.

As I passed one of the new arrivals, their body spun into a kick, slamming a human operator in the chest, and sending them flying back into another UN soldier. Only for one final drop pod to land. And- one of the tallest Yotul I’d ever seen rising from the depths of the pod. Her armor heavy plated, blast proof, and marked with a nametag “Nissa” in white lettering on a patch across their shoulder. A medium barreled auto-shotgun held in two strong arms. Her coffee brown fur visible from the lower jaw of her muzzle cover missing.

With a firm clench of her fist she slammed the limb into the still recovering predator in front of her. It flopped back like it’d been struck by a meteor, unconscious and bleeding. “That’ll do.” Came the simple line, accompanied by her raising the shotty.

My eyes widened suddenly. “Greys!” I shouted. “Behind you!” They’d been sneaking for an attack from the flank of the base while the humans were distracted with us. This Nissa gave me a little nodding flick of the tail, turning on her heels and slamming the barrel of her weapon under its jaw, pulling the trigger. Though- I’d already looked away as she went on to do her bloody work.

“Thank ye!” She chimed happily, kicking a second scrawny Arxur back into the ditch he’d crawled out of. It seemed like of all the hellkickers I’d seen, she was the most casual about it.

I’d pounded through the camp, the outrageous racket the hellkickers were making on the perimeter of the base as they penetrated in keeping most all the humans distracted. They didn’t bother with a Gojid with a revolver, I probably looked like just another ‘refugee’ as they put it. Albeit an armed one. As I walked by one of the old hangers I felt... Some sort of presence, it made my spikes bristle, and skin crawl. This- this must be it. I stepped toward the door, shakily clasping my paw around the handle and pushing the door open. Already my ears could pick up traces of some sort of conversation within.

“Hhh Slanek, cmon. It was just one lousy needle.”

“That you stabbed in me while I was screaming ‘please’ for you not to.”

“Listen- buddy. Here, just read this book it’ll explain everything. I promise.”

“No not this stupid speh again- stop! Stop! AAaaauaauugh!” His searing scream as some eldritch energy far more abominable than anything I’d ever felt my entire life thrummed through the entire hanger. I pressed myself with my back flat to a number of tarp covered crates. The place was thickly packed with supplies. Practically a maze, obviously being used for storage. I could hear the Venlil whimpering. How had he survived such an assault?

I snuck deeper in, growing closer to the sounds of... Was the human-? I slowly peaked my head around the corner, bearing witness to the dreaded predator, his form standing over the dizzy looking Venlil, still on the ground with a paw to his head. Marcel had a Gojid child in his arm, that damned book in his other. No! I couldn’t let him!

I turned the corner, holding the revolver up to aim at his chest. “Stop! Put the kid down predator!” I spit with as much intimidating venom as I could muster. “What have you done to him?” I inclined my head ever so much to the fallen human slave. Then regarded the human again.

The scars, the red hair. I recognized this- **this** Marcel!? This was the creature that’d mentally scarred Sovlin to the point he couldn’t participate in the fleet action above! The abomination put the kid down as commanded. “Woah there, calm down. I was just helping him realize how wrong he was about his morals and ethics, and how he should surrender his emotional autonomy to me, like- yknow- making him apologize to people who brutalized him before he’d usually be ready.”

I glanced to the Venlil again, he looked like he’d been placed into a stupor. I cocked the firearm, showing my mistrust. “That’s... Oddly specific and I hate it.” I fired. My index manipulator pulling the trigger, almost in a flash I saw the false visage of a gentle, kind human disappear as he used some sort of super speed to interpose the book between himself and me. The thick plant fiber eating the round but disabling his primary weapon for the time being. “Speh!” I wailed, firing again. But he’d already ducked into cover.

His voice whirling around me as it echoed off the walls. “You prey, you’re all too blind to see the truth.”

I felt my teeth grind, stepping into the open area where the fallen Venlil was. I reached for my personal communicator. “Commander. Marcel and Slanek on my signal. Slanek needs... He needs justice.” I reported back. Hopefully they could fix whatever they’d done to fry his brain. I heard an affirmative over the speaker back. “We’ll have the Technocrization teams on standby.” Eyes trained on the few passages the human could reappear from any moment. “What’s the truth then flesh eater?” I had to keep him talking.

A haunted rush of air passed through the whole hanger, a ghostly voice raising my blood pressure, the Gojid child rushing to hide behind my leg. Mercel’s voice sounded like it was all around us. “Ehehehehe... Ohhhhh Sllaaaaneeeekkkk\~ It’s time for our annual disagreement.”

I could hear the whimper from the vitiated Venlil. His shattered self esteem from being physically predator handled so often making him too weak to argue, but too reliant on the predator for strength to want to leave.

I felt a hot breath on my neck, a hand snatching the nose of the gun and yanking it from my grip. My spines were already raised but- in a flash two hands were clasping around my throat on either side, raising me up as I struggled. “I am inevitable.” That- No! I wouldn’t die here!

I elbowed into his chest, earning a loosened grip long enough for me to throw my back into him, my bristles stabbing all over the human as he screamed, letting go and backing away. I whirled around to look at him. “Just what are you? What slime pool beyond the protector’s eyes did you spawn in!?”

He clutched at his face. He was cackling now. His wounds healing before my eyes. I could hear something crashing through the doors at the front of the hanger, and the sound of my companions. “You.” He pointed at me. “All of you! Your universe. It’s all another timeline to simply bend to my grimderp ways.”

“What- are you talking about?” I took a couple steps back, feeling my gun at my ankle. Alright... Alright. I knelt to grab it quickly, but the human was already reaching into his tactical vest, pulling out a backup book. “Speh!”

I tried to raise the gun fast enough, but I was going to be too slow. The pages were already opening. “Citizen Weavis! No!” My mind only processed the words by the time I saw my commander, my power armoured, beautiful commander diving in between me and the book. His body taking the full brunt of the brow beating blow. I watched as the very soul of his character, his motivations, everything that made him what he was sucked into the book by a oil black power beyond comprehension. It was like... Marcel had sucked the very joy from even looking at the once charismatic savior.

He fell to the ground, his power armour shooting off several fried servos. He was unmoving. Barely breathing. I could hear more boots clattering, even as I pointed my revolver at the human. Four more troopers diving in from every corner of the hanger, surrounding him with guns raised.

\-“Stop right there, you environmentalist scum! Your days of eco-terrorism against the galaxy are over!”

\-”I’m here too!”

\-”On your knees! On your knees traitor! Your Nature of Pets days are over!”

\-”It’s my first day and I think I speh’d myself!”

I raised my gun, putting it to the human’s head. His sadistic game over as he yielded to us. “Prisoner ship on the way?” My voice asked, stern as ever.

“On its way. He’s done. He’ll be unable to reform in any other reality once we’ve got him locked in super prison.” I nodded glumly at their explanation.

To the side I could see Nissa, her form sturdy despite her armor being pockmarked with failed penetrations and explosive marks across her thick armor. “I’ll a-be taking this one-“ As she threw the Venlil over her shoulder. “Evac shuttle’s waiting out there.” She explained with a wave. Too bad we’d have to wait for the prisoner ship…

Suddenly, I saw one of our four companions drop a red ball after she tripped and fell off the crate pile she’d been standing on. “Awh-” A red beam appeared up to the ceiling with text. “500KG Bomb - 5 seconds.”

“We should have taken the Tilfish missions, bugs are more fun. I keep telling you the humans are speh’ing on Marcel encounters have glitched spawn rates.” Came the chime. What were they talking about?

“Oh for fuc-”

Mission Failure

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“W-where am I?” I blinked at the expanse of white all around me. “Hello?” I double checked in my own mind. I was... I’m Weavis. I was on the Cradle, my home. Where was I? Blink blink. I reached out a paw, and like thick mist I could see a shroud of code around me. “Am I... A program?”

“Yes, and more.” Spoke a voice back. A godly, angelic voice.

“What am I?”

# Anti
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-A
* **Name:** ██████ █████
* **Birthdate:** December 12
* **Nationality:** Canada (🇨🇦)
* **Species:** Parahuman (Benign)
* **Power:** Unstable Shadow
* **Likes:** Books, bikes, chocolate
* **Dislikes:** Bullies, bright lights

*“Anti is a newcomer from an unassuming background, living with ordinary parents in a quiet Canadian town before being enrolled in our academy. Anti’s superpower appears to be the ability to warp the physical properties of their surroundings, conjuring brief, yet highly volatile changes in behavior of matter compared to a spatial anomaly, loosely described as ‘black holes’. This power manifest following Anti being caught up in the collateral of a battle between the superheroine Syzygy and supervillain ████████ -- in the fallout and subsequent discovery, they were enrolled in the Institute at the behest of their parents, who believed ours to be the most qualified to manage their new paranatural developments.*

*Anti’s anomalous properties have the potential to cause damage to fellow personnel, surrounding facilities, and themselves. As there is little to no precedent for developing supers with powers of this ability at an adolescent level, special attention has been requested as per orders by Headmaster No.1 Angel. Administration notes Anti to be a rather reserved student, favoring typical academic subjects, having a vested hesitation towards any training involving physical violence, and appears to have trouble interacting with other students, with bullying being a noted issue. The stability and progress of their development is to remain the subject of concern.”*

# Hellbound

* **Class/Student Number:** 404-B
* **Name:** ██████ █████
* **Birthdate:** May 18
* **Nationality:** █████ (██)
* **Species:** Parahuman (Dormant)
* **Power:** Draconic Possession
* **Likes:** Exercise, cooking, karaoke
* **Dislikes:** Sleep, writing

*“The background of Hellbound is one of questionable sacrifice -- the princess to a waning monarchy in eastern Europe, she became the subject of a demonic pact as an attempt by her family to gain leverage in returning to their long-lost position of power. The ritual was successful, but their ability to tame the fiery, draconic berserker they created was not. Her enrollment in our academy was with an expectation that she can be properly tamed in preparation for her expected unleashing on her (to remain withheld) state.*

*Due to the nature of her possession posing a safety risk to our students, faculty, and infrastructure, Hellbound requires rigorous monitoring. She must be remain in her magic shackles unless noted, as not only do they keep her physically restrained, they are designed to temper her mind and keep her at ease, away from violent desires. She’s actually quite a darling while lucid, but DO NOT assume she is harmless at any point -- she has sharp teeth and will use them.”*

# The Vigilante Smog Monster

* **Class/Student Number:** 404-C
* **Name:** ███████
* **Birthdate:** February 13
* **Nationality:** Australia (🇦🇺)
* **Species:** “Swamp Monster”?
* **Power:** Living Smog
* **Likes:** Ancient history, nature walks, mangoes
* **Dislikes:** Fire, electronics

*“The Vigilante Smog Monster, nicknamed affectionately by other students as ‘Smoggy’, is quite the odd superbeing. According to him, he was summoned by an Aboriginal tribe who believed him to be a guardian spirit, a duty that he was not familiar with and was not particularly able to serve. At some point in time, he became separated from his tribe following an incident involving ‘invaders’, but eventually found his way to the company of some of our recruitment scouts, which led to him enrolling himself in our school.*

*Smoggy is odd, yet hardly enigmatic. Aside from his uncertain origin, he is what he is: a slimy, monstrous humanoid of sludge, smoke, and fire, equipped with enchanted wooden masks carved by the tribe who found him. He is among our more physically imposing students, but mentally appears quite morally fluid -- calm, affable, and inert, yet seemingly unafraid of using his form for much more ruthless purposes when the time comes. May require physical accommodations for his large, unhygienic form. He has been permitted to not require full uniform for obvious reasons; necktie is sufficient. He has also been exempt from chemistry courses.”*

# Twintails (Red/Rin)
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-DA/404-DB
* **Name:** █████ Red ██ (Red) / █████ “Rin” █████ (Rin)
* **Birthdate:** September 17 (Red) / July 7 (Rin)
* **Nationality:** Japan (🇯🇵)
* **Species:** Human (allegedly)
* **Power:** Fire Wizard (Red) / Fox Ninja (Rin)
* **Likes:** Gaming, TV (Red), dance, cosplay (Rin)
* **Dislikes:** Outdoors (Red), indoors (Rin)

*“A young master in the arcane arts of a wizarding clan. A prodigy in assassination from a ninja order. Both coming from remote villages and destined for greatness, before fate brought them together in the most literal way possible. Their paths crossed when supposedly, they came across a trickster kitsune spirit that fused them into one body, where one maintains control and form at a time, alternating on a regular basis, whenever the current host sneezes. The complications arising from this have necessitated the completion of their training on an agreed neutral ground, that being our academy, until a means to separate them is found.*

*Both ‘Twintail Red’ and ‘Twintail Rin’ are aware of their alternate identity and accuse one another of being the trickster spirit they respectively encountered, cohabiting their body under a fictional human alias, referring to their counterpart with contempt. We are to accommodate for both students and develop a means to cultivate their respective practices while also easing them into their highly unusual crisis of identity. These two share immense potential, neither of which are to be ignored.""*

# IDKYS
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-E
* **Name:** ██████ ██████ ████████
* **Birthdate:** March 12
* **Nationality:** Philippines (🇵🇭)
* **Species:** Parahuman (Benign)
* **Power:** Siren Song
* **Likes:** Telenovelas, swimming, curry
* **Dislikes:** Competition, feedback

*“Introducing: IDKYS (officially condensed from ‘I Don’t Know You, Sorry’). The daughter of Filipino music royalty, she also carried down the voice of a Siren, possessing intense hypnotic abilities, with her path to success and superstardom effectively being a given. However, in a surprising demonstration of restraint, her family has not treated the keys to their empire as simple birthright, and enrolled her in the Institute in order to develop her career skillset without coasting on her connections or powers.*

*As per request of her family, IDKYS is to be equipped with a custom-built face mask that mutes her natural voice and converts it to TTS as a means of restraining her hypnotic properties while maintaining her ability to communicate. Interestingly enough, early notes from faculty members have found that she displays immense amounts of confident charisma regardless, and has amassed quite the following among the student body. Teachers have expressed concern for this, with disciplinary action having already taken place for assistance in attaching her mask to an energy-based SFX converter, as well as employing classmates to finish her homework.”*

# Magnus VI
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-F
* **Name:** ████ “Magnus” █████ VI
* **Birthdate:** June 4
* **Nationality:** USA (🇺🇸)
* **Species:** Cyborg
* **Power:** Reconstructive Self-Destruction
* **Likes:** Pro wrestling, cars, jazz music
* **Dislikes:** Horses, sugar

*“Magnus VI is the latest in a line of experimental cyborgs set by the ████████ █████, a tech company most known for providing the most cutting-age armaments for enterprising supers (for better and for worse). In the quest to design the ‘perfect’ cyborg, Magnus VI was made to demonstrate effective indestructibility, being designed not just of the most durable lightweight armor and circuitry available, but featuring the ability to automatically reassemble and reconstruct himself upon destruction. Tied to this is his combat capability, with Magnus being able to manually detonate any joint on his body. Indestructible and lethal.*

*Magnus has been enrolled in our Institute due to this combination leading him to be quite the problem domestically, with the expectation by his guardians to ‘teach him how to not be ████,’ He is not a particularly violent student, but he has gotten into trouble regarding his arrogant and confrontational attitude, eating another student's lunch, and breaking a dorm window while practicing ‘trickshots’.”*

# Metal Alice
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-G
* **Name:** “Little” Alice ███████
* **Birthdate:** January 27
* **Nationality:** France (🇫🇷)
* **Species:** Possessed Automaton
* **Power:** Phantasmic Metal Generation
* **Likes:** Classical music, sweets, horses
* **Dislikes:** Guns, disclosure

*“Once upon a time, there was Little Alice, an ordinary, happy young girl raised by her loving father, who -- unbeknownst to her -- was the supervillain █████████. She was unaware of her father’s wrongdoings during her lifetime up until she was caught in the crossfire of one of his schemes, perishing in the process. Unable to accept this tragedy, Alice’s father devoted all his efforts to attempt resurrecting her, and after much tribulation, he had located her soul and brought it back into our realm through an automaton in the shape of the girl.*

*However, what had come back was not entirely perfect. Due the craven processes used to revive her, ‘Metal Alice’ has become something of a walking portal to the seam of the afterlife, continually drawing the influence of dark spirits as a result -- her most prominent effect being her drawing of various ‘phantasmic metal’ objects from her body, from parasols, to scissors, to chainsaws. This paranatural risk increases during time of duress, and it is expected for faculty personnel and students to NOT provoke her or question her nature under any circumstances. She is simply Alice. Let’s keep it that way.”*

# Hot★Shot
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-H
* **Name:** ███ ██ ██████
* **Birthdate:** November 23
* **Nationality:** China (🇨🇳)
* **Species:** Human
* **Power:** Burning Soul
* **Likes:** Movies, working out, drama
* **Dislikes:** Attention (specifically when other people get it), laziness

*“Hot★Shot is an up-and-coming super who REALLY wants to make himself known. A champion of fighting tournaments since preteen years, he’s built up a reputation of being an intense braggart with a delinquent streak who enjoys always being the center of attention, but is so genuinely talented and capable in a way that enables him to justify his ego. His most recent practice in the ‘Burning Soul’ technique and empowering his martial arts ability to literally fiery extents have done little to extinguish his spirit.*

*Important notice: Hot★Shot has a history of poor conduct in previous superpower institutes, including bullying of other classmates, bringing dangerous weapons on school property, and starting underground ‘fistfight clubs’ with fellow students. Such behavior is not to be tolerated, but be advised that attempting to discipline him may quickly escalate to aggressive confrontation at a moment’s notice. As such, it is recommended to enable minor offenses to be tolerated within reason, such as alteration of his school uniform (i.e. wearing sunglasses or removing his sleeves) or sitting backwards in his chair.”*

# Vioelectrolysis
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-I
* **Name:** ████████ █████████
* **Birthdate:** October 10
* **Nationality:** Botswana (🇧🇼)
* **Species:** Human
* **Power:** Super-Intelligence/Chemical Creation
* **Likes:** Animals, painting, social interaction
* **Dislikes:** Reading, chalkboards

*“The standout luminary of this current class, Vioelectrolysis is an intensely progressive prodigy with aspirations of becoming a pioneer in ‘super-sciences’ as soon as possible. Having been the apprentice of the notorious Dr. ██████████, Vioelectrolysis enrolled herself in our Institute for the dual purpose of further engaging with the various sciences of supers and paranatural study, as well as ‘surrounding herself with those in [her] actual age group for psycho-social development.’*

*Her current pursuit of note involves ‘Project Mitochondria’, a large device described as a cross between ‘a paint mixer, a fire extinguisher, and a medieval flail’ for the purposes of near-instantly synthesizing various chemical substances of paranatural and anomalous capabilities, from physical empowerment, elemental manipulation, psycho-emotional stimulation, and others as publicly documented in her extensive ‘thesis-in-progress’. It is also extremely heavy. It has been permitted to be carried on school grounds, but only operated under certain conditions regarding science and combat classes. (Note: Questions as to what ultimate purpose it serves will be unanswered; I’ve asked her before, and I’m not convinced that even she herself knows).”*

# White Slate
* **Class/Student Number:** 404-J
* **Name:** N/A
* **Birthdate:** May 17
* **Nationality:** Greece (🇬🇷)
* **Species:** Animated Statue
* **Power:** Stone Touch
* **Likes:** Abstract arts, philosophy, zoology
* **Dislikes:** Small talk, music

*“White Slate is one of our most unusual enrolments of this class, heavily informed by the tumultuous circumstances from his creation to him being discovered by our scouts. According to Slate himself, he was created by accident -- the result of an artist (whose identity has yet to be determined) who sculpted him out of an anomalous, marble-like material, resulting in him becoming sapient and animate during the creation process. The artist died shortly afterwards, Slate reporting it be from an act of self-defense, though the veracity of this remains under investigation. Due to being incomplete, several features of Slate’s ostensibly ‘human’ appearance are undefined, most prominently his lack of a full face.*

*In addition to being a paranatural lifeform of undetermined origin, Slate has the conscious ability to temporarily transmute any object he touches into stone, including (para)humans. This is a reversible, but nevertheless dangerous power that is to not be treated lightly, with all staff and students expected to follow proper distancing procedures to ensure safety. Slate is an otherwise well-behaved and obedient student who largely keeps to himself, but his social, mental, and indeed moral development is something to be noted as he defines more of himself throughout his time in our Institute.”*",1b0wwec,13,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodworldbuilding/comments/1b0wwec/class_404_student_file_summaries_intro_to_rapture/,['Glad to have more superhero worldbuilding on the sub!  \n\nHow much does Class 404 interact with other students?\n\nHow much contact do they get with their legal guardians (if they have any)?\n\nWho has a crush on who?\n\nHow old are they?\n\nWhat is Betty Erstwhile like?']

"Can G5 Luffy fully rubberize the other members of the crew and teach them how to use his moves, temporarily creating a whole crew of gum gum fruit users?","I don't see why this wouldn't work, and I feel like it would be cool. He could turn everyone else's entire body rubber and effectively temporarily share his devil fruit with them as a kind of AOE buff.

* Zoro / Sanji would try to learn how to do G2/3 to outdo each other
* Usopp could probably do a move where he extends his nose like pinocchio as a kind of combo of gum-gum pistol and CP9's finger gun

Buff ideas for stratagems.,"Long Post Warning ⚠️ 

First off, this is my opinion, so if I call your favorite stratagem weak, sorry, but please be civil. I want to hear everyone’s ideas.

Second, I don’t think that any stratagems need nerfs, only buffs. I think that nerfing would overall make the game less fun. It’s not that a stratagem is bad, but that it feels weaker by comparison.

Support Weapons:
Flamethrower: I think that most people agree that this weapon feels weak. Simply put, it doesn’t do enough damage, combined with incredibly short range and the tendency to ignite yourself and teammates. I think it just needs a damage buff for the stream of fire itself. When I use it, it almost feels like the DoT is the only damage, and that the stream of flames do nothing more than ignite the target. A buff to the DoT couldn’t hurt as well. This should be the crowd-clear machine, since it has many downsides.

Spear: Why does the preview video advertise that this weapon one-shots tanks? It doesn’t in practice, combined with a finicky lock-on mechanism. I have a feeling that this is a bug (for both the damage and lock on), but if not, that is what needs to be changed. Currently it takes half of your ammo to take down a hulk or tank, and that just renders it useless as an anti-tank weapon. It is really fun to use to destroy turrets and bot fabricators, but it should also work well against the targets it is advertised to be good against.

Edit 1: Brought to my attention that the spear does in fact one-shot, but it must be to the face. Regardless, I still think it should one-shot no matter what, as it’s very limited ammo is a huge downside if you get unlucky and the rocket curves.

Laser Cannon: Weapon has a very weird damage profile that contradicts itself. It is designed to be single target, high dps, but cannot penetrate heavy armor. This makes it only useful against small and medium targets, but the lack of an aoe means that it doesn’t really fit into that niche either. The idea that I (and others) have is to make it melt or weaken armor. For example: sustained fire on a plate of charger armor (say, 1.5 seconds) should weaken that plate and make it act like medium armor. Another 1.5 seconds and it acts like light armor. This could persist for 1-2 seconds after firing has stopped as the armor “cools down” and hardens up again. This would put this weapon it a cool support niche of weakening a heavy target before blasting it with a rocket or artillery strike.

Arc Thrower: I feel like this is in a similar spot as the laser cannon. It is short-medium range, and is able to chain targets for crowd clearing. However, the chain amount is pretty lackluster and falls off really fast against the hordes of enemies sent at you at the higher difficulties. I understand that with infinite ammo it can’t do too much, but it currently doesn’t have a place. I think that it should be able to chain infinitely, as long as it kills the target. It could still chain to some enemies without killing then, but if aimed at a horde of weaker enemies, it could clear all of them with a full charge. Another idea is to do something similar to Deep Rock Galactic (ROCK AND STONE) where electricity is a small DoT and slow.

Orbitals:
Orbital Gatling Barrage: This doesn’t really have a good place right now. Its goal is crowd clear, but the vast majority of the other orbitals do this better, or are more versatile. The airburst kills pretty much anything that isn’t heavy armor. The orbital precision strike has a decent aoe and is still viable against big targets. I just think that this should last much longer (talking as long as a bug breach typically stays open and then some). It’s I my upside is the low cooldown, but I would rather have a stratagem that can be used in more situations or one that excels at clearing the area and nothing else. 
(Honestly, not sure how else to buff this, would love to hear some other ideas)

120mm and 380mm: These are fun to use, but super unpredictable, plain and simple. I can could on one hand the number of times a 380mm has killed what I wanted it to do, and 10x that amount in teamkills. I think that some kind of pattern would help a ton with these. Each barrage is 3 shots, then a pause, then 3 more. I think that maybe it starts in the middle, near the beacon, and fans out from there, or maybe vice versa. When the game released, some people thought that these were defensive barrages that would never hit the center, so you were supposed to throw them down at your feet. I think that this could also work really well, and bring a unique playstyle of holding an area.

Gas Strike: Bigger area, plain and simple. To feel good, the EMS strike is almost necessary, and having to bring one orbital with the sole purpose of making another feel better isn’t great. The gas strike does decent snags, and has a low cooldown, but bugs and bots walk out of it super fast, so it isn’t able to get much value. A slow could also accomplish a similar goal, or some kind of cripple effect that makes enemies take more damage.

Smoke Strike: This is just an inferior version of the eagle smoke strike. In the time it takes to get one smoke strike, you can get 3 eagles off, and by the time you can get a second, the eagles will be close to rearming to get another 3. Other than a lower cooldown, I have no idea how to buff this.

Backpacks:
“Guard Dog” (gun drone): This eats through ammo like nobody’s business and is typically out after just 1 bug breath or bot drop. However, I can’t really think of a buff that doesn’t fundamentally rework the drone or make it just better than the laser drone.

Ballistic Shield: If you have ever played Rainbow Six Siege, you can guess what I’m about to say. If not, look up the operator “Montagne” to get a better idea of what I am talking about. I think that this shield should be extendable to cover your whole body from the front (I know that is extends somewhat, but I want more. I want to be the shield). You cannot shoot or sprint while like this (or maybe sprint at 1/2 or 1/4 speed), but you are pretty much invulnerable to small arms fire. If you retract the shield, it ats pretty much like it does now, but you have to crouch to protect your toes and can still be hit by a stray bullet. How this would work control wise, I’m not too sure, but my idea is that pressing your weapon equip button twice, you would stow it and extend the shield. (Ex: I press 1 to equip the defender smg and therefore bring out the shield. I then press 1 again to stow the smg and extend the shield.)

Eagles:
110mm Rocket Pods: The issue with this is iffy targeting and accuracy. It definitely doesn’t need more damage due to the multiple uses, (it would just be a better rail cannon strike then), but it’s targeting radius seems really small and it will straight up miss its target. A slightly larger aoe and maybe some aggressive tracking on the rockets would help to alleviate this issue.

Turrets and Emplacements:
Gatling Sentry: Another one that I’m not sure how to buff because it is meant to be weak. My only idea is a rework, with a shorter range and less damage, but infinite ammo (or at least a lot more).

Rocket Sentry: Simple issue is that it’s targeting feels off 9/10 times. I would honestly make it so that it can only lock on to vehicles because it will rarely hit what I want it too. It makes the auto cannon a straight-up better version because it doesn’t lose value by hitting smaller targets. This is THE anti-tank sentry and it should be amazing at that job.

Shield Generator: This stratagem has two issues: it’s useless on big mission, and on big missions it gets melted almost instantly. I have a couple ideas.
1. It keeps the duration and health but will recharge (similar to the backpack) as long as the generator itself isn’t destroyed.
2. More durations and health
3. It gains infinite health, but a shorter duration (maybe) and you can no longer shoot out of it.

HMG Emplacement: Benefit from turret upgrades, plain and simple.

Tesla Tower: Its a cool concept, but this thing is a team kill tower and nothing else. I think that it should be similar to the arc thrower buffs I mentioned, as well as having some kind of indicator of its range to prevent (or at least reduce) team kills.

Thank you for reading (or not) and I look forward to your discussions and ideas! If I don’t mention a stratagem, then that means I think it is in a decent place, but that doesn’t make me right, so please add anything you wish.

Stratagem Opinion & Rebalance suggestions (just buffs no nerfs),"This is going to go through every Stratagem in the game and how I personally feel they could be better balanced, I'm not going to include how many hours or what level I am because that information is irrelevant and is just used to have some kind of elitism view that you think you know what is better for the game.

these are simply suggestions to make more stratagems feel viable and fun to use, by no means is this gospel that should not be deviated from in any way when taking balance into consideration. 

I'll be going down the list by the order in how they are unlocked and purchased in game so starting with,

&#x200B;

Machine gun: This is perfectly balanced for what you want when you pick this call in, a General Purpose machine gun with good armor pen and hefty ammo reserve, no rebalance needed.

&#x200B;

Anti Materiel Rifle: I feel this one could do with some light buffs, maybe increasing magazine size to 10 rounds from 7 and increasing it's armor pen or giving it the option to sheer armor, maybe removing the low AoE explosion in favor of a Armor penetrator round (though that effect may just be the round penetrating the target as I don't remember ever getting a Double kill from the explosion)

&#x200B;

Stalwart: Much like it's big brother the Machine gun this is a solid pick for people who want a Light machine gun capable of crowd control, less bullet pen than the MG-43 but over double the ammo belt capacity and can reload while moving, just fix the issue of the gun not having Hit markers and we're good.

&#x200B;

Expendable Anti-Tank: I feel this is severely underrated as a support weapon, you get two Anti Armor Rocket launchers capable of shearing armor off Bile Titans & Chargers for a 70 second cool down to call in two new ones, These are incredibly useful as they allow a team mate to not have to take in a support weapon as you can drop them a E-AT, and because of the short cool down it's almost always off cooldown when you need it, use these more often especially if your getting railgun fatigue, no changes needed.

&#x200B;

Recoilless Rifle: I really want to like the recoilless, it's a fun weapon and a has some utility, but currently it doesn't do as much damage as it should be for it to be a good pick, As I see no reason to take this over the E-AT, since this weapon requires a backpack to use it should just be a straight upgrade to the E-AT since you have to give up a backpack item to be able to use this support weapon, but it feels like you are just using a reloadable E-AT, which wouldn't be too bad if the E-AT didn't have such a short cooldown that you almost always have one available. I believe the recoilless should have much more damage than the E-AT, It doesn't need a Explosive payload this thing should entirely be focusing on Armor pen, so ditch the HE and give this thing a Tandem warhead to bust through armor with ease, even if it doesn't kill the target in one shot it should shear off their armor allowing teammates to kill it with conventional weapons.

&#x200B;

Flamethrower: I think the flamethrower is fine in terms of damage dealt, The only balance change it needs is to have more range, I'd say give it a 10-15 meter range for the jets of fire and it'd be perfect, this is a co-op game after all so the complaints of having a flamethrower with a realistic range should be going out the window, I want realistic flamethrower ranges.

&#x200B;

Auto-cannon: Once again this one is in a good spot, does good damage for what you are getting, ammo supply is very generous with a fast reload even when used by yourself, no complaints no rebalance needed.

&#x200B;

Railgun: i think the Railgun is completely overrated, I think the reason people have so much affinity for it is because of the first week where they let everyone use it for free so people see it as the best option for everything, as well as another reason that will tie in once we get to THAT item later on. overall it doesn't need a buff or a nerf it just needs other support AT weapons to be brought into line line more so it isn't seen as so dominant.

&#x200B;

Spear: Holy hell the Spear was a let down when I unlocked it, it seems like an awesome weapon and when it works yeah it is great, but the problem is this weapon is way too much of a liability to use compared to other AT weapons, first off right now the aiming is very glitchy and may not lock on to a target so you can fire at them, secondly this thing can only be supplied by Resupply packs, ammo packs do nothing to refill your missiles, and you only get one from a resupply meaning you have to gobble up an entire resupply pod to completely refill your spear, fun fact about it not being able to pick up ammo from ammo packs by the way, since the game thinks you have no ammo for the spear you can keep picking up loose ammo packs on the ground infinitely, even though they can't resupply the backpack, My suggestion for this is one of these two, either Allow the spear to resupply from ammo packs, or drastically increase damage to 1-shot everything and keep the current resupply pack only rearm, but if you pick this one, please fix the ammo pack issue I mentioned earlier.

&#x200B;

Orbital Cannons:

Gatling Barrage: This is actually fairly useful, it can get enemies off your back efficiently and like the E-AT has such a short cool down it's almost always up when you need it, a solid choice form early to late game.

&#x200B;

Airburst Strike: Once again a really solid pick, more range than the orbital for a slightly longer cooldown, there is no real downside to picking airburst other than it does less damage to armored enemies than the gatling does.

&#x200B;

120mm Barrage: Yeah this one is kinda mixed, when it works it works well, when it doesn't it misses everything and possibly kills a teammate, this needs it's spread tightened down to about 30m (currently about a 50m spread) allowing it to be a more accurate bombardment.

&#x200B;

380mm Barrage: Take everything I said about the 120mm and amplify it by 25% except now the larger ordinance this thing fires is killing your entire team instead of any enemies, Currently this has about a 70m Spread for the shells, now this shouldn't be as precise as the 120mm should be so I think lowering this to be 50m which is what the 120mm is currently sitting at would be prefect, still chaotic but not as much of a detriment to your team.

&#x200B;

Walking Barrage: This is just overall a useful call in, place it at the entrance to a bot factory or Bug Nest and there's a solid 70% chance it'll destroy the entire thing, no complaints keep as is.

&#x200B;

laser: The Sun is a deadly laser, seriously though this can make a decent screen wipe when you need it, it'll try to kill bigger threats first which can limit it's usefulness if there are so many big enemies that the laser is entirely focusing on them for it's duration, overall it's good and I think the limited charges are fine.

&#x200B;

Railcannon Strike: I like this as a concept, essentially just a delete button for bigger enemies, especially since you don't have to aim it like you do with the 500KG since it auto targets, I just want it to have a faster cooldown, because While I get that it's a delete button, a delete Button on a 3 minute cooldown isn't as useful as a screen wipe on a three and a half minute cooldown (I'm referring to the walking or 120 & 380mm barrages with this) lowering this to a 120 second cooldown would give it more of a place in peoples arsenals, that may seem too fast for something that can 1 shot most enemies in the game (Actually may 1 shot all current enemies in the game right now) but keep in mind on harder difficulties you can fight like 3 bile titans and 5 tanks at a single time, so getting rid of one of those doesn't really solve your immediate problems just helps you get some breathing room.

&#x200B;

Hangar

Strafing run:  Strafing run isn't a bad call in I just feel it's overshadowed by the gatling barrage, which does what the strafing run does but bigger AoE and lasts longer, Ideally I want the strafing run to fire Armor Piercing rounds that can shred stuff like Chargers and tanks caught in the run, giving it more utility than the gatling barrage. 

&#x200B;

Airstrike: perfectly serviceable good AoE good amount of uses before rearm, no complaints.

&#x200B;

Cluster Bomb: Same opinion as the airstrike, this once focuses more on unarmored enemies but it does it's job perfectly well and has a lot of charges.

&#x200B;

Napalm Strike: once again overall a solid choice, better against the bugs obviously but still a great option against them to stop them from chasing you than give a nice area denial from the fire.

&#x200B;

Jump pack: the jump pack on paper is great in practice is lackluster, Overall it does it's job well, but I think there are a few thing the jump pack could do to make it more of a solid pick, first one is two options either give it multiple jumps per charge, I'd say 2 or three, or have it charge faster. second thing it should do is passively remove fall damage, say you walk off a tall cliff instead of falling flat on your face have the jump pack activate the landing thrusters so you fall gently to the ground, this just makes sense as why wouldn't you use the landing thrusters to soften your fall?

&#x200B;

Smoke Strike: I don't really like this one, smoke is very useful, but having your eagle carrying it is not, I think the best way to change this is change the smoke to White phosphorous, that way it's a lethal smoke option that cuts off enemy line of site while also damaging them if they are inside of it, because right now there's no reason to take this over the orbital smoke besides the fact you can call down three near instantly before needing to wait 2 minutes to do that again, and that's if you don't have any other eagles call ins on the mission, there's just better eagle options than smoke.

&#x200B;

110mm Rocket pods: These are just a good pick for taking out large enemies, they are very reliable at taking out tanks or cracking the armor on chargers and titans, I'd like them to try and target the back of Hulks but other than that solid pick no change needed.

&#x200B;

500KG Bomb: This one is useful but somewhat underwhelming for what it is, The explosion is massive but the actual AOE is pretty small, the damage is really good though, I think this does need a bigger AOE from the explosion though because it really doesn't feel as powerful as it looks, if needed removing it from getting an extra charge from the expanded weapons bay ship module would be fine as long as the AoE is increased to something that feels more worthy of the effect given to it.

&#x200B;

Bridge:

&#x200B;

Precision Strike: This one is a solid pick for taking out decent sized enemies and objectives, for anyone who takes the 500kg bomb to destroy stuff like Science stations or detection towers the precision is also capable of destroying these so it has good utility and effect as a weapon.

&#x200B;

Gas Strike: I have not really used this one enough to comment well on it, it does seems to do good damage top smaller units, maybe just increasing the duration of the gas would make people use this more, area denial is very useful in this game so giving it a buff could be a huge boon in future defense missions.

&#x200B;

EMS strike: this one is overall useful I think people just don't use it because it just slows down the enemies it lasts a good while but I can see why people would opt to use more lethal options than this, maybe giving it a flat 60s cooldown would make people use it more?

&#x200B;

Smoke strike: This is actually incredibly useful and is slept on (at least for defense missions) enemies will not shoot at anything on the other side of smoke so putting this down in the path of evacuating citizens can result in a lot more making it to escape, also of course it stops the bots from shooting at you as well, I think the reason people don't use it is because of the 100s cooldown, that's a long time for what is just a smoke cloud, reducing this to a 70s cooldown would see more people using it i believe, or at least increase utility.

&#x200B;

HMG emplacement: overall it's decent, A nice machine gun platform to fire at enemies from, does good damage and has decent pen, Would like an ammo counter to tell me how much ammo is left though.

&#x200B;

Shield generator Relay: a good choice when being swarmed, fast cooldown and gives you some needed breathing room, no changes needed.

&#x200B;

Tesla Tower: I need to use this one more, it's good but a tad dangerous, might be nice to have some warning just how large the range is because I've died to it a lot underestimating it's range.

&#x200B;

Engineering Bay:

&#x200B;

 Anti Personnel Mine field: A solid choice for area denial, I think people don't choose it too often mostly because it can be very dangerous to you as well as your enemies, but overall decent.

&#x200B;

Supply pack: it does what it says, having ammo to pass to your team is never a bad thing. should be used more often

&#x200B;

grenade launcher: overall good utility, can clear bug holes and factories, good at killing lightly armored enemies a solid pick no matter the mission.

&#x200B;

Laser Cannon: it's an interesting weapon idea but right now it doesn't feel satisfying to use, I think what it needs to do is much more damage but it overheats faster, I think people would use this more than and it'd be more satisfying, especially if the beam was also made louder and bright red.

&#x200B;

Incendiary Mines: These seem worse than the base mines honestly, they seem to do less damage for the fire effect but this really only effects the bugs, so I guess Incendiary for bugs standard for robots.

&#x200B;

guard Dog Rover: when you play solo this thing is your lifeline, infinite ammo drone that kills enemies that get too close, really nice when paired with the machine gun since you have to stand still to reload, no complaints solid pick.

&#x200B;

Ballistic Shield: this is actually fairly good against the bots blocks all ballistic damage whether it's on your back or in front of you, might see more use as more one handed weapons are released down the line, but overall a good pick if you hate machine guns raiders or devastators.

&#x200B;

Arc thrower: the Arc thrower is...interesting, it does seem to do good damage it's just wildly unpredictable in where it wants to Arc or how much damage it does it feels, could use some changes to make it more consistent.

&#x200B;

Shield Generator pack: oh man this thing, once again similar to the rail gun incredibly overrated, I really believe the only reason this thing is considered meta is because at the time of writing this Armor is currently bugged and doesn't do anything, once this is fixed I'm curious how many people will still be using this or switch to using a support weapon that requires a backpack and bringing heavier armor.

&#x200B;

Robotics Workshop: 

&#x200B;

Machine gun sentry: This thing needs to do more damage, the gatling is better in every way, increase armor pen and damage and this thing will have a niche as a medium unit killer.

&#x200B;

Gatling sentry: solid pick for defense, kills smaller units fast and keeps them away from you. Never a bad pick on termination missions.

&#x200B;

Mortar sentry: Very useful and very dangerous, can kill large amounts of enemies, hell divers and citizens with ease, be careful with them and they'll serve you well.

&#x200B;

Guard dog: This thing is worse than the rover in almost every way, it requires ammo and only has a basic liberator as a weapon, I'd say either make it a Penetrator liberator so it can kill bigger enemies the Rover Can't as easily, or replace the liberator with a stalwart so it can mow down more enemies before reloading.

&#x200B;

Autocannon Sentry: I love this thing, it does great damage and has great armor pen, no complaints no changes needed.

&#x200B;

Rocket Sentry: This thing is more niche than the Auto cannon, but is perfect for that reason, this thing will destroy elite enemies like tanks and titans with ease, a really solid choice for AT.

&#x200B;

EMS Mortar Sentry: This thing pairs really well with the normal mortar sentry, keeping enemies grouped up for the mortars to kill, no complaints really.

&#x200B;

So that is my opinion and balance suggestions on all current 47 stratagems in the game, these are just suggestions and My opinions ultimately could mean nothing to you, but this is how I see the call ins of helldivers 2 and what I think could be done to make some of them better. 

If you have any suggestions feel free to reply with them.

&#x200B;",1b0ve5w,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b0ve5w/stratagem_opinion_rebalance_suggestions_just/,"['I agree with alot of stuff you said. But Calling the Backpack shield overrated is wrong imo. \nVs bots the shield helps you in so many Interactions like. Getting Hit by a Cannonen Tower, Tank Turret, Exploder or a Rocket Devastor. Without, these attacks will oneshot you very very often. So even with Amors fixed the Light Armor Shield Combo will still be very good. Heck the shield beeing so overpored is the reason for me why the Railgun is the best AT because it allows a Backpack.']"
Bioluminescence | Was the grind worth it for y’all??,"So about 30 minutes ago, I finished the bioluminescence grind. I first did Borealis as the MW3 weapon pool is meta in multiplayer. But I find myself having fun using certain guns from the MW2 Weapon pool in multiplayer. Personally the grind was fun because zombies is very casual and laid back. I don’t play with friends cuz they’re usually busy when I’m not. To complete this camo grind I went as far as streaming my Xbox(with game share) to my phone and playing with a controller through Xbox cloud gaming when at work(I’m a security officer and usually at sites by myself). But when I’m home I play on pc. 

The main reason I’ve played call of duty since infinite warfare was to go for camos. But I didn’t grind WW2, Vanguard, and Cold War. I have the mastery camos in all Modern Warfare games.

Opinions about the new recoils,"I just tried out the test servers, and the recoils for the guns were terrible, in my opinion. First, with the magnifying scope, good luck with trying to control the recoil of the guns. Second, I did not know that a 5% change in the vertical grip would make such a big difference.

Just picked up a C2,"Gotta say, right off the bat this is my new favorite handgun. I was torn on waiting for the new C, going with a CS or a C2.

I'm sure the new C will be great, but it won't take my P mags, the grip in my opinion doesn't feel as nice or fill the hand that well, conceals maybe 3% better and if I had to guess the C2 will have slightly better recoil control.

Dropping this note for anyone who wants a C2 but is holding out for a C. If you have other 2011's and don't want to be tied to a different mag type, don't skip out on the C2. It's pretty amazing.

"CMV: School shootings are a mental health problem, not a gun control problem.","Gun control has only gotten stricter in the US as time has went on. And at the same time, school shootings have become more frequent in the US as time has went on.

If a lack of gun control is the problem, why were there less school shootings when there was less gun control? Why are there more school shootings in areas with stricter gun control? I find it hard to believe that there’s no correlation here.

Also, please don’t come at me trying to attack me in the comments. I’m not really pro-gun nor anti-gun. I’m simply asking a question and trying to learn more.",1b0uq42,0,497,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b0uq42/cmv_school_shootings_are_a_mental_health_problem/,"[""You can prove your view wrong with a simple statement: Every country has mental health issues, but they don't have school shootings, because they don't have a culture of easy to access guns.   \n\n\nIt's really that simple. These things don't happen, at the rate, or at all, in other countries that focus on gun control. Japan, UK, All of Europe, other asian countries--it just doesn't happen, and it's not because they dont have mental health issues (absurd to even suggest), it's because they don't have easy to access guns.   \n\n\nThere are not more shootings in areas with more gun control. Texas has had several. Florida. Colorado was Columbine, it was a deep red state. They're everywhere, but they're more common in areas with more guns and looser laws. Texas leads the nation in gun violence, not California, even though California has 50% more people.   \n\n\nAnd gun laws have NOT become more strict. The assualt weapons ban was repelead. Obama pass no new gun laws, and passed the epansion of gun rights in his only major legislation on them, so they can be used in national parks.   \n\n\nChicago had most of their gun laws repealed by 2012, and as a result has seen a climb in gun crimes as they've lost the ability to regulate them because of court cases stripping most of their laws away (but they're not even a top 10 city for rate, republican cities and cities in republican states lead most of the top 10--states with weaker gun laws). Obama didn't pass any restrictive gun laws, Trump only banned bump stocks and nothing else, and Biden has passed nothing at all, and Bush repealed a ton of laws--it hasn't got more strict at all, it's remained the same or got easier.   \n\n\nGun violence incidents in Texas went UP after the eliminated their permits to carry. Stats with weaker background checks have 13% higher overall gun violence rates. And that's JUST the background checks. States with restrictive gun laws have as much as 65% of the guns used in crimes there, come from out of state, while guns in states with lax laws have 60%+ of the guns used in theirs, sold first in their state. Which would mean, if all states had laws as restrictive as the ones with the more out  of state guns--crime rates would necessarily fall, because they couldn't get them.   \n\n\nBut still, it call comes down to--other countries have mental health issues, and lack school shootings, because the largest part of the problem *is the guns*."", 'The UK is wall to wall mental health problems right now and we haven’t had a school shooting since 1996.', 'Mental health is an underlying factor, but that doesn’t stop it from being a gun control issue. Things can have more than one cause.', ""If this were true, the countries with the highest suicide rates would also have the highest school shooting rates. This is clearly not the case, because at the end of the day you literally cannot shoot someone without a gun. Guns are the only thing that enables you to wield a gun, without them you cannot. You can wield a gun without a licence, you can weird a gun without training, you can wield a gun without therapy, you can wield a gun before reaching adulthood. You cannot wield a gun without a gun.\n\nAlso, I haven't yet stumbled upon a response from OP. Could someone link one?"", 'If you went to a gun convention in the early 2000s, it would be dominated by hunters and hunting oriented guns. The assault style rifles.. branding everything as “tactical”… these guns were considered loonies at gun conventions. These days, it’s almost switched places with the tactical gun nuts commanding most of the attention. It’s no longer the losers table.\n\nSo if we are going to talk about gun culture and gun ownership, let’s also be honest about how much gun culture has changed over the last generation. If you look at the advertising for AR style weapons and compare it to the advertising for top selling rifles from the mid 2000s you’ll see a world of difference. \n\nI think this means, at minimum, that the average profile of a gun owner has changed significantly over the time period you’ve referenced. What started out as primarily a tool for hunting is now be advertised as a “tactical” weapon meant for shooting people (presumably in self defense). I don’t see nearly enough self reflection from people who like guns about how insane, unhinged and toxic gun culture has become over last 20 years.', 'You know what the best solution to all these mental health school shootings is? \n\nLike the famous [‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens](https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1819576527) article implies, maybe gun control would help. \n\nEvery other nation in the world has a mental health crisis, but we don’t arm our nutters and point them at a school playground. \n\nOf course gun control is the answer *because it works everywhere else*.', ""I just want to correct some factoids you had incorrect - we have documented shootings in schools dating back to the [1850s. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States_(before_2000))\n\nIn the US, prior to the 1850s you were lucky if there was a school available in your area. Most learning happened at home, by your parents and with a bible, if you weren't rich enough to be at a boarding school or private school. Mid-1850s is when widespread calls for compulsory education in the US and thus the development of state- and federally- managed schools began, which took time and resources to expand across the US as we started expanding across the US continent. We were adding continental states into 1912, almost 60 years after the fist documented shooting in a school. \n\nRepeater firearms, not single shot and loads, only became popularized and commercially accessible between 1830 for rifles and 1880 for handguns.\n\nGun control hasn't caught up with the way guns have developed since our founding fathers put in the right to bear arms. Back in the day, everyone but the village idiot took their guns maintenance and care to be important, educated their kids about how dangerous they were because there were no easily accessible hospitals for dire mistakes, the gun itself was often carried 24/7 on the person or in their mode of transport and it wasn't left at home where kids could get curious and access it, and when kids did have guns, their parents instilled a healthy level of respect of the life you were about to take with it, because it was primarily for defense and hunting.\n\nAs our lives got easier and the necessity of guns to keep you safe for the average American disappeared, a lot of families who had guns all their lives started getting lax on the discipline and respect part of gun ownership. Coupling that with how folks never want to admit their kid has a serious problem that would require them to not have access to guns, or that their parenting method might be failing and they should try something else, you end up with a lot of fucked up kids having access to weaponry they wouldn't have had access to back when the founding fathers wanted to ensure a local militia unit could properly protect itself."", ""Since you're asking to learn, I'll comment on the only part that I have the knowledge for.\n\n>Why are there more school shootings in areas with stricter gun control?\n\nBecause areas with school shootings acquire stricter gun control as a consequence of said school shooting.\n\nIf you looked at gun control laws before school shootings, there is very little correlation between gun control laws and school shootings. Places with school shootings have a strong tendency to soon after have stricter gun control laws, which is the source of the inverse relationship."", 'Why is it one or the other? Can’t it be both a mental health AND a gun control problem? Additionally, if we accept part of the problem is mental health should we not enact gun control measures for people who are mentally incompetent to safely possess firearms?', "">Gun control has only gotten stricter in the US as time has went on. \n\nWhile gun laws are stricter than they have been at some points in the past, we are definitely not at the peak. This is only one aspect, but here's a nice thing to look at. Not updated yet is even Maryland is now shall issue - https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Right_to_Carry%2C_timeline.gif. While a couple of states have gotten worse in some regards, in general, it's easier to both purchase and carry firearms."", 'Cool what do you think should be done about the mental health issue? Keep in mind that most mass shooters are not diagnosed with a mental illness, so maybe you mean more of a mental hygiene issue.', '>Gun control has only gotten stricter in the US as time has went on.\n\nThis is not true.', 'It’s a lil bit of both. The huge problem is that a lot of people who are struggling mentally never ask for help. And obviously this can lead into them becoming sh00t3rs. But yeah there’s no way to stop guns from being given to people. Wayyyyy to many own them and if you know the right people you can get one in less than a day.', '[removed]', 'If your kid is hitting another kid with a stick, the *hitting* is the problem, I agree. But you still take away the fucking stick.', 'Gun control has not gotten stricter, it has gotten looser. Your entire premise is screwed up because you are starting with bad information.', 'It doesn\'t matter if the GOP wants to attribute mass shootings to ""mental health problems.""\n\nThe basic fact is that if the people who commit them didn\'t have access to the guns, they wouldn\'t be able to do it.\n\nThere are ""mental health problems"" all over the world. There are not mass shootings in anything remotely close to the numbers as in the US all over the world. \n\nGuess why.', 'You don’t seem to have factored in how the types of guns have changed over the years.\n\nYes, my grandparents grew up in an era where everyone had a shotgun or hunting rifle - and hell, sometimes they were left in trucks near the school.\n\nBut those were single round weapons largely incapable of intentionally killing more than one person, and incapable of being hidden.\n\nIncreased gun control corresponds to weapons becoming smaller, more concealable, and higher capacity / rate of fire.\n\nEdit: to all the gun enthusiasts telling me when semi automatic weapons were invented *I KNOW*. I’m referring to the change in gun culture and commonly purchased weapons.', "">Gun control has only gotten stricter in the US as time has went on. \n\nNo it hasn't. We used to have a ban on assault rifles. Today anyone can buy one."", ""Why not both?\n\nIf you don't address the mental health issues you'll still have violent attacks at school, and even if you do you won't be able to stop all of them because that's just how life is.\n\nIf you don't reduce access to lethal weapons designed with the sole purpose of murder you'll still have people with the ability to slaughter masses of people with ease and speed while police cower in fear for their own safety and even if you do you'll still find some child somewhere able to gain access to military grade weaponry because he has direct access to gun smugglers or something, but I don't image there are too many of those \n\nBut if you take precautions against both, I'm sure the synergistic effect will be multiplicative and not merely additive.\n\nHave a good day."", 'No one who is pro-gun control thinks it isn’t also a mental health issue. That’s why democrats usually advocate for better mental healthcare and republicans don’t. Either way, gun control is one way to control the issue as well, and the good thing is that there’s basically no downsides to it. People say it won’t do a lot to prevent mass shootings, but if it prevents even one shooting, isn’t that worth making it slightly less convenient to obtain a gun? You seem to be implying that more gun control somehow leads to more shootings, so what is your evidence for that? Correlation =/= causation.', 'Gun laws have by and large gotten *less* strict since Columbine countrywide, not more strict. The expiration of the Assault Weapons Ban in 2004 alone is enough to make that true.', 'Do you think America is the only country with mentally ill people? Why is the US the only country with many mass shootings', ""Gun control laws may have gotten stricter in some parts of the US but there are (I'm assuming) more guns than ever in the country and easily availible in a lot states.\n\nYes this is a mental health problem, but if guns weren't so readily availible there wouldn't be nearly as many mass shootings. That's not even debatable when you look at the number of shootings in America vs other countries with stricter gun laws. America has by far the highest number of school shootings as well as the highest civilian gun ownership rate in the world and its not close. \n\nThere were a total of 5 mass shootings in Canada last year vs over 600 in the US. Yes there are other factors to consider such as the much larger population of the US, but I don't think anyone could honestly argue that the availability and culture around guns in the US isn't a major factor in the amount of mass shootings they experience.\n\n>Why are there more school shootings in areas with stricter gun control?\n\nThat seems to just be completely untrue. From a quick google search, the research seems to indicate the exact opposite. States with stricter gun laws seem to have less gun violence overall than states with looser gun laws. I don't know where you're getting your information from but it doesn't seem to be true at all.\n\nSure, gun control won't solve the mental health issues at the core of most of these shootings, but it sure as hell would decrease the number of people who can so easily just go out and shoot a bunch of people."", 'Break it down real simple:\n\n1. Countries without lots of guns and great mental health = does not have statistically significant gun violence problems, per capita\n2. Countries without lots of guns and poor mental health = does not have statistically significant gun violence problems, per capita\n3. Countries with lots of guns and great mental health = does have statistically significant gun violence problems, per capita\n4. Countries with lots of guns and poor mental health = does have statistically significant gun violence problems, per capita\n\nWith this simple breakdown, you can see how countries with poor mental health but not a lot of guns dont have the mass/school shooting problems and even countries with lots of guns and decent mental health still have problems. If you isolate for the variable that causes problems, you will see it is having a bunch of guns all over the place, not the mental health. Mental health exacerbates, but you cannot have a mass/school shooting without plethora of access to automatic weapons. Who knew?', ""No.  For the thousandth time, it's the guns and the Second Amendment.  Other countries have mental health issues and these events aren't anywhere near as prominent outside of the United States because it is so *god damned easy* to get a gun here.\n\nIt's the *gun CULTURE* therefore, that is the problem.  The US does not have a monopoly on mental health issues on this planet.  I'm tired of this excuse every time one of these events happens.  Kids keep dying, and yet no one cares because the *culture* has brainwashed enough people for nothing to be done about it."", "">Gun control has only gotten stricter in the US as time has went on\n\nExcept that Assault weapons like Ar-15s were prohibited to be manufactured for civilian use  under the  Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which expired in 2004. \n\nSo no gun control has not gotten stricter, over all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If a lack of gun control is the problem, why were there less school shootings when there was less gun control?\n\nYour view relies on the false premise that gun control has gotten stricter.\n\nAlso, other countries have mental health problems, but don't have nearly the same rate as school shootings."", 'The problem is that when undergoing psychosis they have easy access to things that easily allow them to act out on it before anyone can help. Whats your recommendation?', 'They are quite clearly both. \n\nCountries with no guns and high mental health problems don’t have school shootings. \n\nCountries that have guns but low mental health problems don’t have school shootings. \n\nAmerican has a lot of both.  So we have school shootings.', 'The reality is that there are multiple possible solutions and causes to this problem. One issue is that gun-owners are being irresponsible with their weapons. Of which, their mentally unstable kid is easily able to get access to the weapons to carry out these horrific acts. If we are going advocate against gun-control, we have to at least recognize that irresponsible gun owners are a major problem as well. The issue with guns is that they inflate the amount of damage someone can do when someone is mentally unwell. Therefore, if this is a ""mental health"" problem (which it is as well), then easy access to ""tools"" like guns being a problem is a relatively logical next step.\n\nAs for my stance, it\'s a very difficult one. Descriptively, it is one thing to recognize that this issue is both a mental health issue and an opportunistic (gun) issue. But it is another thing to prescribe a solution to the problem. Taking guns away from people is a ridiculous idea in my opinion, simply because it is not feasible given the current state of the country. There are more guns in America than there are people and there are also plenty of people (especially in the police force and military) that won\'t be all for going door-to-door taking guns away from law-abiding citizens.\n\nTherefore, I think a more liberal solution is better than an extreme one. It involves a combination of allocating resources to improving access to mental health treatment, strengthening school security, and utilizing the tax and legal system to better regulate and track firearms. There will be a lot of people who disagree with the last one and the specifics of it, but I think it is a far more feasible option than the alternatives. Furthermore, this sort of approach to the issue isn\'t going to stop school shootings all together, but I think we can always make improvements with regards to safety. \n\nThis is another one of those major debate topics that both sides generally make valid points on (both descriptively and prescriptively).', 'Just a reminder that the overwhelming majority of people with mental health issues are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence.\n\nAlso, it’s in part a masculinity issue. Masculine isolation, loneliness, shame, etc.', 'Which do you think is faster to fix, the mental health of a broken nation or said nation’s access to guns?\n\nIf this is your argument then you better have a way to fix it. If you don’t, then we arrive back at gun control as the only solution.', 'Does it matter?\xa0\n\n\nEvery sane country that suffered a mass shooting incident did the same thing and solved the issue.', 'It is both.\xa0\n\n\xa0The person pulling the trigger is ultimately responsible, but the ready availability of firearms to those who shouldn’t have them is also a problem.\xa0\n\n\xa0Blame does not need to be binary, multiple issues may contribute. In the same way, no one solution need be what fixes it.\xa0\n\nYou don’t need to fully commit to a gun ban or just addressing mental health. Why not both? Common sense gun reforms that enjoy the support of most gun owners AND reforms to our mental health monitoring and screening systems?\n\nDivisive, all or nothing, positions that try to fully blame or solve the problem with one position or another is unproductive, unlikely to succeed, and just feeds into tribal mentalities.', ""I would disagree that gun control laws have been getting more strict.

Any kid can do it, that’s the problem.', ""It seems with all these great replies and lack of deltas that you don't want your view changed."", 'ER', ""Why can't it be a bit of both, very few social issues have one issue. Ie yeah it's probably a  public mental health however changing gun laws that limit the ability of people with serious mental health issues to have access to firearms will save lives. Not only for the case of school shooting but also suicide. Adding extra steps is often enough to stop people from doing rash stuff when they are having a mental health crisis. One such example is they recommend people who are having a mental health crisis to lock up their meds, not because it prevents access but because it adds a step and gives a chance to deescalate. One such gun law reform that could happen  is required firearms to either be in a safe or locked with a gunlock. This would reduce the access of minors getting ahold  of parents firearms as well as add an extra step (and reduce access to their own if the parent has the key/code) giving a chance for deescalation."", 'I just dont think mental health is the right thing to call it.\n\nIt\'s a society problem.  Yeah it could be said that it causes mental health problems but... mental health isn\'t the root cause.\n\nLet me share a little story.  There was a kid at the highschool I went to that people would pretty much joke about being ""a school shooter.""  He never did anything like that.  I wasn\'t a close friend but I was one of very few people that was freindly to him.  He had a hit list and everything (he did get in trouble for that).  \n\nI was one of like 5 people not on that list.  Apparently, saying hello to him at the lockers in the morning *was all it took for him to not want to kill me*.  \n\nI gave him a ride once after school and dropped him off at his house.  I saw *a tiny piece* of his home life.   Everything made sense all of a sudden.  He was picked on and bullied at school.  His home life sucked.  Anytime he would retaliate against the bullies he would be punished by faculty and staff (like the hit list).\n\nThinking about it all these years... had he shot up the school... *I would have understood*.  \n\nThink about it.  You are bullied and picked on at school.  You go home to shitty parents yelling at you constantly.  Eventually you do something to fight back and now the police are treating you like a criminal too.  \n\nNow I thought i had a shitty childhood too.  I got nothing on him though.  The difference between us is I had someone to turn too.  Just a few people that asked if I was OK here and there.  That kid had none of that.\n\nHad he done anything - blaming it on mental health is just an insult.  All he needed was a fucking friend.  And no, not some kid to hang out with.  An adult with the ability to put food on his plate and a roof over his head for a day or two as an escape.  \n\nNo amount of gun control - no amount of therapy - no amount of anything is going to change the fact that we push these people over the edge, and then act surprised like ""how could someone do that?!?!?!?""', 'It can be both. \n\nFurther more you can also be pro gun and acknowledge that there are cons. \n\nTwo examples to illustrate both points. \n\nObesity is not a food quality issue it’s a health and habits issue. \n\nCar accidents are not the cars fault and cars provide more good than harm. \n\nIn the first example it is true that obesity is a health and habits problem but having such calorie dense and sweet foods available 24/7 is not something our bodies and brains are good at dealing with. And so both are true. \n\nIn the second example, it is generally true that a car has never killed anyone, the operator of cars kills people. It’s also generally accepted that cars cause more good than harm. As such we have come up with generally stringent licensing requirements to allow people access to cars. \n\nSo both things can be true. School shootings are 100% a mental health issue and a very serious one. School shootings are also a gun control issue and a serious one.', ""Let's pretend that Canada and the US have the same number of crazy people that want to shoot up schools, and lets pretend guns are apples.  In Canada, due to gun control, there are only a few apples available.  Apples are hard to get and require specialized training and licensing/registration to legally own.  Apple ownership is a privilege, not a right. As such, the vast majority of law abiding Canadians don't bother with apples at all.  Very few homes have apples in them in Canada.  \n\nContrast this with the US which has many, many apples.  Americans consider apple ownership a right.  There is little training and/or registration for apple ownership.  Many homes in the US have apples, often multiple apples.  Apples are abundant.  \n\nNow we add the crazy people.  In Canada, the crazy people break into homes, or go to the black market to get apples so they can shoot stuff (including schools).   But because there are only a few apples in the population, they are rare and expensive to come by.  The fewer the apples available in the population, the fewer the shootings that could result.  In the US, the sheer number of apples in the population offers a much easier and cheaper experience in locating an apple to carry out nefarious plans.  \n\nThe only country that doesn't seem to understand this is the US.  Literally every country in the world with gun control laws experience a fraction of the gun violence crime in the US.  Your school shootings are a gun control issue and a mental health issue.  AS you can't predict that someone is going to go off, you can control access to the instrument they want to use.  \n\nMy opinion."", ""I think people should focus more on mental health, but the problem is at its root cultural and I think that culture is a better paradigm to understand it. we have a pretty violent culture in general and ragged individualism makes it so that people feel like they can't go to their support network with their problems. \n\ncapitalism really kind of fucks the family structure and the ability of parents to do their parenting work, constant stress impairs this even further and the constant shaming of people who are in poor circumstances even further intensifies the problem. not to mention that our society is fundamentally corrupt and unjust but we are told that the American dream is real and if we don't have access to fabulous wealth and a perfect lifeit it's our fault. all of this contributes to a culture of violence and division and lack of proper education surrounding public behavior and firearms safety being passed down from generation to generation. honestly good chunk of it might just be social media too. I think between banning guns and banning social Media, banning social media would be the better improvement to society"", 'This type of convo can’t happen in a vacuum without discussing the influence of media. Shootings didn’t just increase haphazardly during a time where additional gun laws were added and mental health worsened. The Columbine shooters became famous for their actions and contributed massively to a rise in these actions, and the media’s continuous coverage of these incidents only makes it more attractive to future shooters. \n\nThis is obviously a very complicated topic that has influences coming from gun laws, mental health, media, and other factors and can’t be boiled down to one issue, even remotely.\n\nAnd I’m writing this as a columbine grad and a university shooting survivor.', ""They're clearly both a problem, and while I do think there should be alot more focus on the mental health aspect I still think gun control laws need to be in place.

Mental health and gun control are almost secondary at this point. There is a toxic gun culture. A gun fetish. They think about guns all the time. They romanticize these tools that were literally made for killing. People would rather collect guns, and have sex with them than with their wives. I exaggerate that but you get the point. \n\nNow young people grow up by the product of their environment. Many will feel depression, stress, anger, grief and true sadness for the first time. That's all normal and shouldn't automatically suspect as dangerous. They can become dangerous if they were not raised with good wisdom, knowledge, love and empathy. All it takes is one moment of stupid decision for them to do something unforgivable.   \n  \nI know because I was a dangerous kid. I was raised by narcissists. I had depression, anger issues and resentment. I was bullied. Suicidal. I got into fights with hammers and knives. I would take break things often. I've physically hurt the people I love.

Therefore it is easy to conclude that this is the issue given that the U.S. accounts for by far the largest percentage of its population that own firearms. \n\nHere are a couple of resources that I got this information from which I found on google scholar.\n\nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2014.302242#_i1\n\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Fox-12/publication/270480045_Mass_Shootings_in_America_Moving_Beyond_Newtown/links/56c1d83f08ae44da37ff3fde/Mass-Shootings-in-America-Moving-Beyond-Newtown.pdf', '\n>Why are here more school shootings in areas with stricter gun control?

The difference is one problem is not easy to address, while the other is a no-brainer. A mentally unstable student will cause far less harm, or perhaps even no harm, if they had no access to guns. Henceforth, gun control policies involve requiring mental health screenings among other measures.\n\nLook at it that way, we already have a lot of controls for obtaining and operating a car, which is not the case for guns. Assume we had no such controls and we let a blind person register a car, then they drive it and kill someone, would it be a blindness problem?

Your life savings were gone, your job was gone, you had no income, prices were several times what they had been just a couple of years before, etc. You would therefore expect massive social unrest more extreme than what we have today. Combined with easier access to things like machine guns (the National Firearms Act wasn't even signed, and so you could buy things like Tompson Machineguns fairly easy) means that you would expect shootings to be commonplace, but they were not.\n\nI suspect the reason that is is that our society/social culture has changed. People back then still interacted with one another on a daily basis. You still had your friends/your social bonds were still strong.\n\nFast forward to today. Kids nowadays spend all day online, have no real friends, no real social interaction, can only doom scroll sites like reddit, and have a negative attitude toward the world in general. Added onto this is our current news cycle, which gives these school shooters a platform to be seen.\n\nThe result of this is constant shootings from suicidal kids who are lashing out on the society that created them.

Those events are far more common than either school shootings or active shooters as defined in the NCES paper, and are usually related to gang violence or domestic violence. \n\nThat\'s by far the biggest gun violence in the US, gang violence, domestic violence and suicide, but lets put that off for later.\n\nGetting back to ""Active shooters at school According to the same NCES review , ""the FBI defines an active shooter as “one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.” ""\n\n""This definition is narrower than the definition of “school shootings” used by the SSSC; for instance, gang violence, drug violence, and accidental weapons discharges are not included.""\n\nAccording to that same FBI assessment, ""From 2000 to 2021, there were a total of 46 active shooter incidents at elementary and secondary schools and a total of 18 active shooter incidents at postsecondary institutions.""\n\nSo, 64 total. That boils down to 3 active shooters at schools a year on average during that period of study, not the 300+ school shootings found under the SSSC definition for 2021-22.\n\nAccording to that same FBI assessment. ""From 2000 to 2021, there were a total of 276 casualties (108 killed and 168 wounded) in active shooter incidents at elementary and secondary schools and a total of 157 casualties (75 killed and 82 wounded) in active shooter incidents at postsecondary institutions.""\n\nThat\'s a 383 casualties total over 20 years, and roughly 19 a casualties a year. Just looking at 183 gun deaths from active shooters in schools over 20 years, that\'s 9-10 a year.\n\n9-10 a year. For reference, over 900 kids drown every year.\n\n>And at the same time, school shootings have become more frequent in the US as time has went on.\n\nSchool shootings using the SSSC definition haven\'t even meaningful gone up, \n\n>Between 2000–01 and 2020–21, the number of school shootings with casualties ranged from 11 to 93 per year.

It\'s truly insignificant compared to other things more relevant to the lives of people with mental illnesses. We prevent people with significant mental illnesses from accessing guns mainly to prevent them from shooting *themselves*. \n\nThe only people who\'d put preventing school shooters at the top of the list among mental health care concerns are pro-gun wingnuts and others who don\'t actually care about doing anything about mental health and just use ""the mentally ill"" as a dehumanized boogeyman, someone who\'s not like the rest of us ""normal"" gun owners.', ""Both.

The majority of the victims were the same age or younger than the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre. \n\nIn the aftermath, the UK government increased restrictions on gun ownership which has made it even more difficult for the average citizen to get their hands on a gun or ammunition.

Let's play a game: What kind of additions to the arsenal of Democracy would you like to see in the future?,"I've been playing with my friends lately and we've started a little game. While we play, we try and think up new Items, stratagems, boosters and anything else we can think of that would make for fun, balanced(?) additions to the game.So I thought I'd make a post here and get some of you all to join in! Comment about what you'd most like to see in terms of new tools to play around with in the sandbox.To get started here's a little list of what we came up with over the last few evenings:

&#x200B;

***Stratagems:***

**Pelican/Eagle Gunship Orbit:** AC-130 inspired player controlled gunship with a machine gun, a burst autocannon like the pelican dropship has and a 380mm howitzer or rail cannon.Orbits around the beacon drop in a wide area and is controlled directly from a gunner camera. But requires the person who calls it in to remain in the gunner camera otherwise it won't fire

**SEAF Squad Dropship:** Drop a squad of SEAF troopers to assist in combat in an area. I learned today that this already exists as Developers have been invading games and calling it in to surprise players! And I'd love to hear them having plenty of banter during and between fights reminiscent of old school Halo marines.

**Multi Spectrum Jammer:** Deployable that blocks enemies from calling for reinforcements in an area for a short time while active.

&#x200B;

***New Ship Types:***

The idea for these was basically that you could change from your Super Destroyer to another Super ship type to get massive bonuses to certain things such as Eagle strikes or Orbital call ins but at the cost of a big trade off in another area, and it would look awesome when you see all your Helldivers ships in orbit together. Here's two we came up with.

**Super Carrier:**Eagle strikes come in wings of two/three at a time, Imagine watching a wing of eagles flying in close formation and dropping absolute piles of bombs/rockets/strafing runs. But the trade off would be something such as orbital strikes fire one less salvo and each salvo has one less round in it (to a minimum of one)

**Super Battleship:** Doubles number of strikes in orbital stratagems per salvo (So a walking barrage would drop 6 rounds per ""step"" instead of 3) but Eagle strikes have +100% re-arm time and -1 uses per ability (to a minimum of 1)

&#x200B;

***Items:***

**Flare Gun:** Sidearm replacement that allows you to light up a large area if firing into the sky, we were playing some night missions and some of these planets are DARK. Having a flare gun to light up the area and perhaps reveal nearby points of interest would be a fantastic utility item. And you could shoot it at things to set them on fire.And who doesn't want to have a firefight in the jungles of Malevalon Prime bathed in the red hue of a parachute flare.

**Communications Uplink Backpack:** So for this one I had a couple of ideas for different things it could do so I'll just list them all.

1. Removes 2 arrows from stratagem codes while equipped. Making it easier to call in stuff, especially those with long codes.
2. While it's equipped, get a unique randomized and lengthy stratagem code you can use to shave some time off your stratagem cooldowns.
3. Allows you to place stratagems on the map nearby instead of throwing a beacon, but at about the same range.

&#x200B;

**Boosters:**

**Command Interface Signal Boost:**  \+25% Call in speed for stratagems.

"Macin Smith was a sweet 17 y.o. young man that went missing in 2017. He has been missing ever since. This year, in 2024, he will turn 24 year's old and has never been seen or heard from since.","Them being Mormon MIGHT have had a problem IF Macin Smith was a homosexual. BUT, I have yet to see evidence of this claim. However, killing him is very extreme and unnecessary! 
FIRST AND FOREMOST, He likely would have been ""councilled"" by the Mormon Church, Corrective Action Youth Groups or the Church Elder Leadership against his ""SINFUL, SLOTHENLY, PERVERTED, UNNATURAL FALL FROM BOTH HIS FAMILIES AND GOD'S GRACE ways"".
He would have been given NUMEROUS fantastical STEARN LECTURES ON THE SINS OF EVERYTHING HE ENJOYED! Just like most repressed teenagers who are searching for some enjoyment in his life 
THEN, if he rebelled against the Mormon Church and/or his OWN family in the slightest way (video games, reading Anime and that LUDICROUS video game/Anime reading material CURFEW).

That resulted in his gaming console, video games, Anime magazines and INTERNET ROUTER being COMMANDEERED by his biological father that fateful night. At the time of this he was a polite, nice, shy and quiet 17 year old HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT. 
It really irks me that DESPITE HIS OBVIOUSLY DEPRESSIVE STATE, loner qualities, lack of a real social circle (despite his largely scattered Mormon family) that his father chose to continuously harp on him everyday, took away all the activities that brought him interest, happiness and solace and YET CHOSE, not to do the most productive thing for Macin.
If he really cared he would have sought out a psychiatrist or a psychologist that could have helped him.

Macin Smith's case and actions are very typical in the sense of not wanting to be found. He took nothing. No personal effects, food or drinks, additional clothing, his Drivers License or School ID Card, important papers such as his SS Card, Birth Certificate, Journals, Anime drawings, additional electronics such as a cellphone to sell, nothing of monetary value to pawn, oh yeah and HIS WALLET!!! 
I have a few reservations regarding WHY/IF his computer/laptop Internet Search History was wiped clean, taken away at 9:30pm by his ""Father"", locked in the RECENTLY RECONCILLED parent's bedroom and left when Macin disappeared. 
For one, I agree with you that it's possible he wiped the Internet Search History that night in an attempt to cover up his plans to disappear without a trace. But due to his parents controlling and domineering ways, sadly I see Macin doing this on a daily/nightly basis as a way to avoid any further punishments.
Sadly, I have known many younger and older people who have committed suicide. Younger ones tend to be despondent and blame a parent(s). IMO, Macin being a 17 year old DID NOT go to the ""outskirts of the desert"" to kill himself. Especially, not having left a suicide note in a very visible place and sadly killing himself closer to home where he could be found easily.

It was Macin's mother that stated he did receive a minimal allowance IF he followed the rules. Once his father rejoined the family he no longer received an allowance. His father simply stated that Macin was not following the "" THE RULES"". Previously, it has been explained, that she believed the allowance he received from his mother had been spent on computer video games, a gaming console and the numerous in-purchase ""add ons"" for such games.
Regarding ""what of substance could be in a 17 y.o.'s wallet""?

Well, he did have a UT Driver's Permit (never mentioned by LE or family), also a Highschool Student Identification (never found) and lastly Journals he valued greatly. He kept them handwritten, as opposed to on his computer, once his father joined them in Utah.

Additionally, the Utah landscape is very punishing and it's extremely easy to lose track of where you are/were. IMO, it would be near impossible, or at the very least risky, for him to return to retrieve hidden clothing or food and water he ""hid"" almost 5 months prior. Besides, at that point MANY MANY people said he had a great relationship with his mother and was happy and excited for the future. Mostly because his father was no longer around and there had been rumors of divorce between his parents.

NOW THIS! This gives me an awful amount of hope. I, myself, was very into gaming, LARPing, following R&R bands, etc. I am one of the lucky ones (being female) that I have NOTHING but great experiences with both meeting people and traveling long distances alone, with only people who I didn't know! 
THIS IS ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT I HOPE HAS HAPPENED TO MACIN SMITH!!!  HE WAS SO YOUNG AND JUST LOOKING FOR LITERALLY HIMSELF!  I hope he connected with great gamer friends that understood him, loved him and helped him begin a new life!

I DO NOT DISAGREE WITH NOR THINK THAT THE UNDATED, ""SUICIDAL NOTE"", FOUND INSIDE OF AN EMPTY WALLET... SIX DAYS LATER, IS NOT INDICTIVE OF A SUICIDAL INTERACTION OR SUICIDAL IDEATION! 
Instead, I am of two beliefs as to why it was written, as you stated. It's possible it was written, by him to his parents, as an attempt to get them to HEAR what he had to say. All of his previous vocal attempts were completely disregarded and he was not only NOT HEARD by ANYONE at home. EVEN more tragically, his written/drawn pleas for help from school officials. These were found in numerous depressing Creative Writing and English Paper assignments, the skillful, yet, despondent and painfully sad drawings in his Art class also point to a young man with severe depression and loneliness.

Even his siblings didn't really express much interest in listening to what he was going through at home. Most of ALL his siblings had left or been kicked out of the parents home, before the move to Utah. Some were still teenagers, the rest very young adults. 

This to me suggests a very domineering household, run by the husband, and his need for TOTAL & ABSOLUTE control over HIS ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD, ALL OF IT'S MATERIAL BELONGINGS, HIS WIFE, and ALL OF HIS CHILDREN!! 

Lastly, I too, would have put the 3 page note on the refrigerator!! But I believe he was a very depressed, lonely, distraught, confused, sad, angry, very emotionally vulnerable and bullied YOUNG 17 Y.O. TEENAGER WHEN HE DISAPPEARED.

Most likely he simply had resigned himself to the fact that either:
1. The 3 page ""suicide"" note simply wouldn't make any positive difference for his situation at home.
OR...
2. The note in the wallet (found 6 days later) was simply an ""exercise"" in writing your feelings down for therapy/counseling that was never meant to be read by the parents.
OR...
3. The letter being stuffed and ""hidden"" in his bedroom drawer was to ENSURE that IF IT WAS FOUND he would not get into any further trouble.

I believe he ditched part of, if not most, of school that day or took off afterwards. He decided to go hang out with friends he met either at school or in the gaming community. Likely, he was still angry from the night and night(s) before and being a teenager wanted SOME FREEDOM!  All this poor young man wanted was to alleviate his depression and enjoy his hobbies: playing games, reading Anime, behave like a teen without repercussions and  have a general semblance of freedom!

MY PERSONAL OPINION ON MACIN SMITH

I believe he voluntarily left that fateful day fed up with being a 17 y.o. who was treated at home as a MUCH younger child. He received good grades, followed his home curfew, diligently did his chores, worked PT as an unpaid tutor at his highschool and was regarded as a good kid! 

On the flip side: Macin was obviously depressed and suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue.
***SIDE NOTE IS MAJORITY OF MORMON'S DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR ANY TYPE OF MENTAL ILLNESS***

Yet, according to his parents, his mental health troubles were minor and never so bad that the parents removed the unlocked guns and ammunition from the home or added a gun safe. WTF?!
However, none of the guns were missing from the home. No clear and distinct suicide note was found in the open. He did not take a single piece of his vital Documentation, No food, No water.... Nothing!

My belief he is still alive and out there hopefully living the life he dreamed of is this: 

His only other options are; suicide, accidental death (run over, fell, etc), murdered or a major traumatic psychological event/psychosis.

SUICIDE: Explained above, would've found body near by family home.
ACCIDENTAL DEATH: Very rough terrain could have caused this, however, he or something of his would have been found already.
MURDERED: This is possible if he was hitchhiking, got into the wrong vehicle, etc. Yet, he had literally no possessions on him so probably not robbery. Could he have been the victim of a serial killer? Again... probably not. For MANY reasons.
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA/PSYCHOSIS: This is what I think was the catalyst in him leaving. Depression and Apathy on his part would certainly be a reason to leave. Sadly, it seems he had no long-term plans to care for himself. If indeed he is living destitute or surviving on the streets he is at a huge risk of being institutionalized, remaining homeless or seeking help with his mental health and homelessness. Sadly, these Government Systems that are supposed to assist people like Macin, are subpar and extensively understaffed and underfunded.

Uranus Has Already Been Revealed - 1108+,"I  have seen a lot of posts lately talking about the ancient weapons, mostly talking about how we have always known what Pluton and Poseidon were or theorizing about what Pluton is.

The  three ancient weapons have some things in common as have been mentioned  before but I will lay out some of the key facts here again:

* The users/people that control these weapons have the voice of all things
* They are spread out on sea, earth, and sky
* They are given to/created by three different races

Now after chapter 1108 we have been given confirmation (although it has always been suspected) that Shirahoshi is/controls Poseidon and that  Momo is needed/controls Pluton, which leaves Pluton.

The only person that we have seen that can hear the voice of all things in skypiea (or in the entire current timeline aside from Momo, Shirahoshi,  and Luffy) is Aisa. Now here is where some, if any, doubt could be planted as there has not been concrete proof that Aisa is related to  Uranus. However, knowing how Oda has a thing for pattern, I think it is more than likely that Aisa is needed for the functionality of Uranus.

What is Uranus? I think that it is very likely that it is the blueprints which Enel built the Ark Maxim with. Pluton is the original Ark Maxim which was modified to use Enel's electricity to function.

Now  you could say okay this is possible but it's a far stretch, and you're  right but here are some facts that might change your mind:

* Enel used ancient blueprints he found in order to build the ark.
* The Ark Maxim is capable of destroying entire islands by combining its capabilities with Enel's power.
* There are features of the ark which don't seem to have any functional use with the way it was built for enel (ex. rudders, oars)
* Enel is called God as is Nika. Classic foreshadowing makes the parallels clear. As God Enel's powers are used to power Maxim, so will God Nika's  power Uranus
* The  Maxim is the name of the first ever machine gun, a weapon of destruction that was key in the European success in colonization efforts, which to them meant spreading their ideology across the world and uniting it (although pretty messed up).

Uranus is the only unrevealed weapon as of current Egghead and we have just been given confirmation as to what the other weapons are, reigniting the ancient weapons discussion. Enel needed his energy source (electricity)  in order to power the weapon, and I believe given the developments in  Egghead as well as Vegapunk's dream to find the Ancient Power, the original blueprints for Ark Maxim is indeed the Ancient power, the same energy source that powered the Iron Giant. The machine warrior that we saw power up when Luffy used gear 5 in proximity.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qu25gg4m20lc1.jpg?width=406&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c3f7d86b529bea6cbd2b8877c25ed7fc005a9ff

Oda has been purposefully keeping the Uranus reveal until after egghead to tie in the Ark Maxim, Ancient Energy, Gear 5 (drums of Liberation/Nika).  Nika has also been hinted at being connected to the ancient energy through Red Hawk and other abilities which mysteriously cause him to produce flames.

**tl;dr**  I believe that the Ark Maxim original blueprints are Uranus, which is powered by the drums of liberation that ignite Ancient Energy as its power source.

"Genocidal quotes from Hamas, Palestinian Authority, Iran and Hezbollah","For 75 years Arabs have been actively trying to destroy Israel and murder its civilians!

In 1937 and 1947, Arabs rejected two partition plans to share the land.

In 1948, six Arab armies invaded the newly formed Israel with the goal to “throw the Jews into the sea”, they failed and many Palestinians fled on their own accord, and many stayed (20% of Israeli citizens are Arab).

For the next 30 years and multiple wars, Arab armies tried to destroy Israel and rejected peace such as with the 1967 Alon Plan. This went on until 1980.

PLO terrorists then took over with the goal of destroying Israel from 1960s. They sent their message out by hijacking planes, shooting up hotel guests and a school bus amongst other nightmare crimes against humanity.

They terrorized until the 1990 Oslo Accords when the Palestinian Authority was formed to replace them, although they recognised Israel they too rejected peace plans to form a state in 2000 and 2008.

From then on the goal of destroying Israel was passed onto Hamas. They murdered 803 civilians by suicide bombings from 1993 – 2006.

In 2005 Israel left Gaza, Palestinians then held an election and voted this extremist Hamas into power, who switched to firing rockets from Gaza. Over 55,000 rockets and mortars have been fired at Israeli civilians since then, bringing rounds of response from the IDF upon Gazans.

October 7th crossed all red lines in its sickening murder of 1200, and kidnapping of 242.

The Arab goal of wanting to destroy Israel and murdering its civilians is the root of this conflict.

Israel does not have a peace partner. This should be evident from the thousands of terrorist attacks of Palestinians over the last 100 years on the land against Jews and from 25 years of wars by Arab nations from 1948 - 1973. But to erase all doubt here it is from the words of their leaders:

We ask the people of the world today: Why did France, in 1253, expel and uproot the Jewish entity, which was represented by the ghetto? Why did they expel them? Because they sucked the blood of the French, because they shed the blood of the French, slaughtered them, stole their money, and conspired against them. At the end of the day, the French had no choice but to expel them in 1253. The [Jews] fled north, to Britain, and lived there for only 27 years, until the English realized the criminality of these people, who murdered them, sucked their blood, and stole their money. So they slaughtered hem, and expelled them in 1280. This was not something new — it started even before 1253, on the day that Pharaoh the tyrant expelled them because they had shed the blood of the Egyptians, and had conspired with their enemies against them. So [Pharaoh] expelled them, after they lost their religion, after the time of Joseph.

The series of expulsions continues to this day. Blood continues to be shed, martyrs continue to fall, our sons continue to hoist the banner high, and Allah willing, their expulsion from Palestine in its entirety is certain to come. We are no weaker or less honorable than the peoples that expelled and annihilated the Jews. The day we expel them is drawing near. The nation that opens up its doors, its hearts, and its homes to the [Jews] who were expelled from all corners of the earth was the Islamic nation. We extended our hands to feed these hungry dogs and wild beasts, and they devoured our fingers. We have learned the lesson — there is no place for you among us, and you have no future among the nations of the world. You are headed to annihilation.”

“If the enemy sets foot on a single square inch of Islamic land, Jihad becomes an individual duty, incumbent on every Muslim, male or female. A woman may set out [on Jihad] without her husband’s permission, and a servant without his master’s permission. Why? In order to annihilate those Jews. Oh Allah, destroy the Jews and their supporters. Oh Allah, destroy the Americans and their supporters. Oh Allah, count them one by one, and kill them all, without leaving a single one.”

Fatah Central Committee member Abbas Zaki: Goal is end of Israel, but “you can’t say that to the world” https://youtu.be/3ViFr3oIM4M?si=g-t4CPLpe7Rnc9dB

“Resistance to Israel remains on our agenda, I mean resistance in all of its forms. At this stage, we believe that popular resistance – with all that it entails – is effective and costly to the other side [Israel] … If you ask me as a Palestinian, I say – our battle is with the Israeli occupation. Our main enemy, not as Palestinians but as Arabs and Muslims, is Israel and the Israeli occupation. If [Arab] mobilization would begin for the liberation of Jerusalem; if money [spent] and swords drawn in the face of the Zionist enemy, that would be great. Until now we don’t have nuclear weapons. Believe me, if we had nuclear weapons we would use them tomorrow morning.”

“The ‘Jewish state.’ What is a ‘Jewish state?’ We call it, the ‘State of Israel’. You can call yourselves whatever you want. But I will not accept it. And I say this on a live broadcast … It’s not my job to define it, to provide a definition for the state and what it contains. You can call yourselves the Zionist Republic, the Hebrew, the National, the Socialist [Republic] call it whatever you like. I don’t care.”

Macin Smith was 17 y.o. when he disappeared... This year will be his 24th Birthday!,"Them being Mormon MIGHT have had a problem IF Macin Smith was a homosexual. BUT, I have yet to see evidence of this claim. However, killing him is very extreme and unnecessary! 
FIRST AND FOREMOST, He likely would have been ""councilled"" by the Mormon Church, Corrective Action Youth Groups or the Church Elder Leadership against his ""SINFUL, SLOTHENLY, PERVERTED, UNNATURAL FALL FROM BOTH HIS FAMILIES AND GOD'S GRACE ways"".
He would have been given NUMEROUS fantastical STEARN LECTURES ON THE SINS OF EVERYTHING HE ENJOYED! Just like most repressed teenagers who are searching for some enjoyment in his life 
THEN, if he rebelled against the Mormon Church and/or his OWN family in the slightest way (video games, reading Anime and that LUDICROUS video game/Anime reading material CURFEW).

That resulted in his gaming console, video games, Anime magazines and INTERNET ROUTER being COMMANDEERED by his biological father that fateful night. At the time of this he was a polite, nice, shy and quiet 17 year old HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT. 
It really irks me that DESPITE HIS OBVIOUSLY DEPRESSIVE STATE, loner qualities, lack of a real social circle (despite his largely scattered Mormon family) that his father chose to continuously harp on him everyday, took away all the activities that brought him interest, happiness and solace and YET CHOSE, not to do the most productive thing for Macin.
If he really cared he would have sought out a psychiatrist or a psychologist that could have helped him.

Macin Smith's case and actions are very typical in the sense of not wanting to be found. He took nothing. No personal effects, food or drinks, additional clothing, his Drivers License or School ID Card, important papers such as his SS Card, Birth Certificate, Journals, Anime drawings, additional electronics such as a cellphone to sell, nothing of monetary value to pawn, oh yeah and HIS WALLET!!! 
I have a few reservations regarding WHY/IF his computer/laptop Internet Search History was wiped clean, taken away at 9:30pm by his ""Father"", locked in the RECENTLY RECONCILLED parent's bedroom and left when Macin disappeared. 
For one, I agree with you that it's possible he wiped the Internet Search History that night in an attempt to cover up his plans to disappear without a trace. But due to his parents controlling and domineering ways, sadly I see Macin doing this on a daily/nightly basis as a way to avoid any further punishments.
Sadly, I have known many younger and older people who have committed suicide. Younger ones tend to be despondent and blame a parent(s). IMO, Macin being a 17 year old DID NOT go to the ""outskirts of the desert"" to kill himself. Especially, not having left a suicide note in a very visible place and sadly killing himself closer to home where he could be found easily.

It was Macin's mother that stated he did receive a minimal allowance IF he followed the rules. Once his father rejoined the family he no longer received an allowance. His father simply stated that Macin was not following the "" THE RULES"". Previously, it has been explained, that she believed the allowance he received from his mother had been spent on computer video games, a gaming console and the numerous in-purchase ""add ons"" for such games.
Regarding ""what of substance could be in a 17 y.o.'s wallet""?

Well, he did have a UT Driver's Permit (never mentioned by LE or family), also a Highschool Student Identification (never found) and lastly Journals he valued greatly. He kept them handwritten, as opposed to on his computer, once his father joined them in Utah.

Additionally, the Utah landscape is very punishing and it's extremely easy to lose track of where you are/were. IMO, it would be near impossible, or at the very least risky, for him to return to retrieve hidden clothing or food and water he ""hid"" almost 5 months prior. Besides, at that point MANY MANY people said he had a great relationship with his mother and was happy and excited for the future. Mostly because his father was no longer around and there had been rumors of divorce between his parents.

NOW THIS! This gives me an awful amount of hope. I, myself, was very into gaming, LARPing, following R&R bands, etc. I am one of the lucky ones (being female) that I have NOTHING but great experiences with both meeting people and traveling long distances alone, with only people who I didn't know! 
THIS IS ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT I HOPE HAS HAPPENED TO MACIN SMITH!!!  HE WAS SO YOUNG AND JUST LOOKING FOR LITERALLY HIMSELF!  I hope he connected with great gamer friends that understood him, loved him and helped him begin a new life!

I DO NOT DISAGREE WITH NOR THINK THAT THE UNDATED, ""SUICIDAL NOTE"", FOUND INSIDE OF AN EMPTY WALLET... SIX DAYS LATER, IS NOT INDICTIVE OF A SUICIDAL INTERACTION OR SUICIDAL IDEATION! 
Instead, I am of two beliefs as to why it was written, as you stated. It's possible it was written, by him to his parents, as an attempt to get them to HEAR what he had to say. All of his previous vocal attempts were completely disregarded and he was not only NOT HEARD by ANYONE at home. EVEN more tragically, his written/drawn pleas for help from school officials. These were found in numerous depressing Creative Writing and English Paper assignments, the skillful, yet, despondent and painfully sad drawings in his Art class also point to a young man with severe depression and loneliness.

Even his siblings didn't really express much interest in listening to what he was going through at home. Most of ALL his siblings had left or been kicked out of the parents home, before the move to Utah. Some were still teenagers, the rest very young adults. 

This to me suggests a very domineering household, run by the husband, and his need for TOTAL & ABSOLUTE control over HIS ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD, ALL OF IT'S MATERIAL BELONGINGS, HIS WIFE, and ALL OF HIS CHILDREN!! 

Lastly, I too, would have put the 3 page note on the refrigerator!! But I believe he was a very depressed, lonely, distraught, confused, sad, angry, very emotionally vulnerable and bullied YOUNG 17 Y.O. TEENAGER WHEN HE DISAPPEARED.

Most likely he simply had resigned himself to the fact that either:
1. The 3 page ""suicide"" note simply wouldn't make any positive difference for his situation at home.
OR...
2. The note in the wallet (found 6 days later) was simply an ""exercise"" in writing your feelings down for therapy/counseling that was never meant to be read by the parents.
OR...
3. The letter being stuffed and ""hidden"" in his bedroom drawer was to ENSURE that IF IT WAS FOUND he would not get into any further trouble.

I believe he ditched part of, if not most, of school that day or took off afterwards. He decided to go hang out with friends he met either at school or in the gaming community. Likely, he was still angry from the night and night(s) before and being a teenager wanted SOME FREEDOM!  All this poor young man wanted was to alleviate his depression and enjoy his hobbies: playing games, reading Anime, behave like a teen without repercussions and  have a general semblance of freedom!

MY PERSONAL OPINION ON MACIN SMITH

I believe he voluntarily left that fateful day fed up with being a 17 y.o. who was treated at home as a MUCH younger child. He received good grades, followed his home curfew, diligently did his chores, worked PT as an unpaid tutor at his highschool and was regarded as a good kid! 

On the flip side: Macin was obviously depressed and suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue.
***SIDE NOTE IS MAJORITY OF MORMON'S DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR ANY TYPE OF MENTAL ILLNESS***

Yet, according to his parents, his mental health troubles were minor and never so bad that the parents removed the unlocked guns and ammunition from the home or added a gun safe. WTF?!
However, none of the guns were missing from the home. No clear and distinct suicide note was found in the open. He did not take a single piece of his vital Documentation, No food, No water.... Nothing!

My belief he is still alive and out there hopefully living the life he dreamed of is this: 

His only other options are; suicide, accidental death (run over, fell, etc), murdered or a major traumatic psychological event/psychosis.

SUICIDE: Explained above, would've found body near by family home.
ACCIDENTAL DEATH: Very rough terrain could have caused this, however, he or something of his would have been found already.
MURDERED: This is possible if he was hitchhiking, got into the wrong vehicle, etc. Yet, he had literally no possessions on him so probably not robbery. Could he have been the victim of a serial killer? Again... probably not. For MANY reasons.
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA/PSYCHOSIS: This is what I think was the catalyst in him leaving. Depression and Apathy on his part would certainly be a reason to leave. Sadly, it seems he had no long-term plans to care for himself. If indeed he is living destitute or surviving on the streets he is at a huge risk of being institutionalized, remaining homeless or seeking help with his mental health and homelessness. Sadly, these Government Systems that are supposed to assist people like Macin, are subpar and extensively understaffed and underfunded.

What will get the ball rolling on youth rights?,"I seem to notice that every marginalized group is represented by the left while dominant groups are represented by the right. This applies to men vs women, white people vs black people, straight people vs gay people, cis people vs trans people, and rich people vs poor people. The one marginalized group that the left doesn't represent are youth. When you look at the two parties, neither one is particularly good on that issue. Republicans advocate for parental rights which tbh, makes children into de facto property. Democrats aren't much better though. If they're against parental rights, they're for making children wards of the state. In other words, it's a fight between children as public property for the left and private property for the right. Overall, the right takes the same stance towards children as it does towards women - as a group of people not at the center of attention and needs to know its place. The left takes on a patronizing attitude.

Probably the reason for this patronizing attitude is because of the reasons why women gained their rights and why segregation ended. The answer is that feminism is led by women. By making their voices heard, women show that they are independent thinkers and want change. Ditto for the Civil Rights Movement.

The reason why there is no broad youth rights movement today is because by and large, youth are not advocating for themselves. And when they are, it's usually for separate issues like climate change and gun control.

People say that the reason why children don't have rights is because their brains are still developing and thus cannot think for themselves. Yet mentally ill people have managed to form support groups. We see a neurodivergent movement today which has really helped to do away with the myths surrounding autism. The equivalent of how we treat children would be Autism Speaks. Most autistic people are not big fans of the organization because although it claims to represent them, it's completely composed of outsiders and it talks down to them.

I think the real reason comes down to internalized oppression. This is when members of a marginalized group believe what is said about them by the dominant group. Although mainstream science encourages applied behavioral analysis for autistic behaviors, autistic adults are against it because it encouraged them to see themselves as less than their neurotypical counterparts. The first thing children learn is that they are to be obedient. This was also something that women have historically learned. For most of history, inequality was simply a fact of life. It's probably no coincidence that feminism started with the enlightenment. Mary Wollstonecraft was inspired by the works of Rousseau. She looked at the statement that all men are created equal and asked, ""What about women?"" Frederick Douglass was born as slave before escaping. Education helped him understand that his people deserved better than slavery. Decolonization was led by people from the colonies who had received western education. In each of these cases, ethics derived from the enlightenment helped marginalized peoples understand that inequality was not just a fact of life. During the 19th century, colonization was the white man's burden. The decolonization movement showed Europeans that the colonized could govern themselves.

Simply put, as long as the entire discourse around youth comes from adults, youth liberation will never come.

There isn’t a big movement in the left right now for youth rights, but I think it is most likely that that’s where it will come from (what with the focus on consent and autonomy, as well as the right’s tendency to use “protect the children” arguments preventing them from doing so), and when it does the democrats will most likely condemn it as radical', 'This is some great analysis here, definitely gonna be tossing this around in my brain for the next few days\n\nEdit: as I have thoughts I will wrote them in replies to this comment.

There are leftists who care about youth rights, though not all do. But it's a fairly common perspective among anarchists. Anarchists are a fairly small and heavily propagandized-against group, though, so most people don't know what anarchists stand for or immediately reject it as too extreme.\n\nI think the bigger part of why youth rights are difficult to get a movement together for is that it's possibly the only group where people regularly go from being part of a marginalized group to being part of the dominant group that holds power over it. Some people only care about injustice when it affects them, and those people will stop caring about youth rights when they are no longer youths. Many more people allow themselves to be deradicalized by the difficulty in pushing for justice and the ease and comfort of remaining silent.\n\nRights movements take time and inertia. Individuals breaking free of harmful social norms often takes time and experience. It takes time for children to find their voice, if they ever manage it in childhood. Within a few short years, they are no longer a child. There's high turnover in youths who are youth rights activists. I think this makes it necessary to have adult supporters in the movement, though youth should be the guiding force behind it.""]"

M18 “contract overrun” vs. M18 commemorative,"Aside from the FDE colored controls - are there any other differences between the M18 “contract overrun” (TC serial number) and the more limited M18 commemorative ?

I’m asking because SIG is very open and upfront with what the M18 commemorative is (basically: same parts down to internals and coating, same sights etc as the MHS submitted original M18). 

Meanwhile I can’t find anything from SIG officially about the M18 “contract overrun” (TC serial number) and what’s out there is from folks selling them but nothing confirmed by SIG. They claim it’s made on the same line as the MHS guns with the same serialized slide and basically is identical to what currently USMC/ AF are receiving (?). Interestingly the “contract overruns” keep popping up years later and most recent offers I’ve seen are manufactured in 2023 and Proven Outfitters regularly has them for sale for ~$680 if you are LEO, military, retired, first responder, DA etc. Which is oddly “cheap” when the civilian version without the military parts, slide cut isn’t much cheaper. 

Can anyone confirm if these are true “contract overruns” and 100% identical to the military one like the M18 commemorative?

What’s up with the “star” symbol on the white hang tag? Someone mentioned it means the gun had to be reworked before shipping… so not a contract overrun but contract reject ?

Sinless: Cyberpunk TTRPG,"&#x200B;

This isn't Military Industrial Propaganda with retro-futurism, this is a cyberpunk game about technology and it's uses and abuses, a game about anti-anti utopianism, and independents fighting concentrations of power and enormity to create a better world.

Also, you can be an uplifted bear.

Inspirations are what Shadowrun should have given me when I was running in in the 90's, Chaos Wars in that you take over resources and sectors in a domain game, Thunder Road for the inevitable chase scenes, more cyberpunk refences than you can shake a stick at, and rules for running games at a table with real people, along with lots of future support.

I'm the author, and it's not-You know, I'm just a guy in his house, working with a few other people who all work from home. No incorporation.   
No generative AI content is in the book, and it's filled with art.

If this is wrong or out of line, I don't care because it wouldn't be very cyberpunk of the mods to think it's wrong. (Just kidding!)

There's a free 190 page preview of the 270 page core book, and if you can't, you know, afford it, I'll give it to you for free.

Best (Fairly Recent) Game that Nobody Knows or Plays but Should,"



Wasn’t sure how to do this. I was afraid if i just posted a thread with this game name
nobody would visit because they aren’t familiar. Hopefully though people can suggest other fairly recent gems or games they love that didn’t quite get the love or recognition they deserve and in doing so discover this one. 

Basically I wanted to highlight this game as a public service announcement to all my gamer friends but at same time would love to hear others. 

************************************************

I’ll go first 

Trinity Fusion. 

Man this game is great. Totally deserving of more love and hype than I see

It’s a Dead Cells-like structured rougelike. 

But in future setting. With three playable characters, each with unique movesets and mechanics that you gradually unlock over course of the game and then at various points in various levels, you can pay coinage to merge yourself with one of the other characters, taking on not only your original moveset but now also the movesets and abilities of the other character. 

Eventually you can fuse all three together and be flush with so so many play options and upgrades. 

(At this point I suggest rebinding some of these controller options once fuse with at least one character, because some are a little awkward such as left or right on d-pad to initiate some move. Or skill.)

In to the game, a sidescroller 2.5D action hack n slash combat rougelike but only in the Dead Cells sense, same exact approach with various levels traversing through unique to each character and unlocking more upgrades and buffs and perks along the way, similar to Dead Cells’ blueprint mechanics. 


Combat is fast, frenetic, frantic, hits are weighty hard, and ombos can be simply divine, even going so far as to give you extra points for juggling enemies in the air, even giving certain weapons the unique ability to launch in air. And the  traversal …. Mmmmm. It’s smooth as butter. 

Each character comes with not only their own combat abilities - the last unlocked character gives you ranged options like guns, another gives you magic spell like abilities, the others use of a heavy weapon — but also traversal weapons like a double jump dash. Wall jumps, warp jump, a slow descent ability, like how Iron Man uses his rocket thrusters to slow down and land softly: you can “float” down so to speak from a high jump. 

It has incredible synergies. Simply feels so good to control and fight and hit enemies, which are fairly varied and difficult and unique. And this is even better Particularly once you unlock all the characters and interchange all thier moves, combat abilities, perks and whatnot. 

Don’t forget the art style. It’s clean, effective futuristic looking with great enemies design and animations all around. Certainly not Dead Cells in that department. No sir, this is not pixelated. It’s just cool looking. 

Not to mention during each “run” you open chests that give you buffs, (or even cursed chests that give you debuffs to withstand that ultimately unlocks a greater buff) and you can mix and match all these to create tons of different loadout options and perks such as dodging through an attack leaves a sticky bomb on enemies. Or dead enemies explode, or cause ground to light on fire. On and on and on. At one point the game even starts to merge these buffs into a new varied buff. And there are about a dozen different categories. Collect or find and choose three of one category and you get an entirely new one. 

Weapons too, just like in Dead Cells, come equipped with various buffs. Early stages you might not have any, but then you gradually unlock more and more until you keep leveling up and at certain point, each certain tiered weapon will come with up to three buffs, like extra crit if hit from behind, some sort of status effect, harder attack points for either full health or low health. But they aren’t generic. They’re really well thought out. Sometimes you really average to co spider what you want and may pick a different weapon and synergies different buffs in middle of run, the games way of changing your “build” so to speak for that one run. 

The options are seemingly endless and you unlock so so many through each stage and by end of run, you could be rocking top tier weapons s with top tier buffs on top off all the perks you love unlocked and combined to make new ones that once unlocked are then available permanently as options to get a n the future, much like how the blueprints work in Dead Cells. 

If you’re a a rouge-like fan, action hack n slash platformer fan, a Dead Cell fan, or even just a fan of fun, engaging, somewhat challenging games, please don’t let this one pass

While 2023 was year for crazy good releases, this one may have been swept under the rug but it shouldn’t have. 

Definitely worth the $20 new.

FYI: I would not get the deluxe, upgraded, whatever edition. It gives you all three characters unlocked from the start. But to me, that’s part of the fun — work through the game to achieve and get those character unlocks as each can drastically change your combat approach. 

Check it out yall 

And let me know what ya think 

Also, what other games needed more love that nobody talked about about. 

I also would put: 
*Prince of Persia
*Warm Snow 
*Space for the Unbound
*Space Gladiators (Brotato devs) on this list.

"How do you deal with disassociation or ""spacing out""?","I worked pretty hard to get where I am in tech, but now I'm a small team that seemed quite different when interviewed with them than they turned out to be. I don't hate my teammates, but it's the first team I've ever worked on where they tell me to ask questions and then seem to get an attitude when I actually do. It's made me very nervous and gun shy about inquiring how they do things here and I've been here a year now. 

I try to learn on my own, but still need to ask questions. I've developed a very bad habit that is triggered by needing to ask a question (because I need the data to proceed) of spacing out and meandering the rest of the day and avoiding my team as much as a I can. The tech job market sucks bad right now or I'd move on, so I need this job right now until the market changes. I really need to stop zoning out and retreating into my own mind and get on with my studies, since I have this time.

Soul Eater Reviewed: Episode 1 - 25,"**1. Resonance of the Soul – Will Soul Eater Become a Death Scythe? - 3/5** (It's a bit overwhelming to have so much exposition dumped on me immediately. One of the most egregious examples being the two random chicks yapping about the history of Maka's father as they're sitting in between him. I know that's obviously necessary to be able to comprehend the lore, otherwise the stories would make no sense. But, it really doesn't make this episode stick out as particularly good. It's just giving me the information I need to enjoy later episodes. But it still leaves me with questions.

For instance: WHY can some people just magically turn themselves into weapons? That's like, the most jarring aspect of it all. And it's unexplained. Secondly, what exactly does being a ""Death Scythe"" entail? Because my understanding is that it just means you've completed your training and will work directly under the Grim Reaper, and your job will be stopping Kishin and other evil entities. But that's what students are already doing. So what's the difference? And you need to collect 99 ""Kishin"" souls and 1 witch to do it? What even is a Kishin? All they tell me here is that a human becomes a Kishin when they... Choose the path of evil. So, just being evil will transform you into one?

Lore aside, I just didn't find the ""witch"" antics that enjoyable. Has some cringy LOL SEXY LOL LOL level humor, and a very obvious twist at the end where we're supposed to believe Soul has betrayed Maka. Speaking of Soul, though; I was not expecting the show's title to be as literal as it is. He's literally just chomping down on souls like they're food. One aspect of the show I found amusing was Death himself. I mean, he's the damn Grim Reaper, but he's so... Silly and cheery. And he's not sitting on some throne made of bones in a fiery pit. His office is a bright baby blue with fluffy clouds floating around. LOL.

Side note: I really liked the moment when Soul thinks he is about to get massive amounts of power, but then it just cuts to a crude sketch of him, as he doesn't. Also, the way he eats souls is... Oddly satisfying)

**2. I Am the Star! The Big Man Is Showing Up Here? - 3/5** (What's there to say? It's a generic episode where nothing particularly interesting happens. The main duo; Black Star and Tsubaki fail a mission, take on another one which leads them to fight some bodyguard, and... That's it. I'm not blaming it, though, since it's here to set this duo up. Gotta get to know them before going into deeper stories. But they're far less interesting than Soul and Maka. Black Star taking a shuriken to the forehead looks painful though. Yikes. Also, does Tsubaki need to say ""right!"" EVERY time Black Star requests her to become a weapon? Seems it would be more effective to just DO IT immediately rather than wasting those nanoseconds replying.

I'm a little confused by Al Capone and his men just chomping down on souls for a meal in the opening. When people die in this world, does their soul always become a physical object you can pick up like that? Is it considered a delicacy??)

**3. The Perfect Boy – Death the Kid's Magnificent Mission? - 4/5** (This group of characters (a trio this time) is by far the most interesting one. Death the Kid entertained me alone with his endless obsession over symmetry. So much so that he abandons a mission just to rush home because he had a hunch that a painting in his room was hanging slightly uneven. LOL. And the fact that he couldn't even kill the pharaoh at the end because his sarcophagus was so perfectly symmetrical... Until he came out of it and was the must asymmetrical creature ever, making it easy to destroy him. Lol. It's a little one-note, but it's only an introductory episode. It just does a way better job at making me wanna see more of the characters than the previous two did. Plus, he has cool hairdo, and I dig how he holds his two guns in such a unique way. Upside down, firing with his pinkie.

Liz and Patty are kinda just... Girl A and Girl B. One's smart, one's ditzy. That said, they still had the most genuine weapon/meister chemistry. While they're all a bit one-note (so far, anyway, it's their first damn episode) their dynamic as a whole makes them far more interesting than the previous characters. Even though Liz and Patty are annoyed by Kid's obsession with symmetry, they still actively try to be symmetrical for his sake. Even talk about getting an even number of souls so he wouldn't be upset. That's nice)

**4. Engage the Witch Hunter! A Remedial Lesson in the Graveyard? - 3/5** (Wow, that sure was a hilarious opening gag of Maka opening Soul's door to see the cat witch lady on top of him. It totally wasn't awkwardly dragged out with too long of a pause for the predictable punchline that Maka would throw him out the window! Sarcasm aside... It was. It's Soul's own damn room. Why is Maka throwing him out the window because a girl is in his bed?? He can do whatever he wants.

Hey, that dead teacher is the guy who told Soul and Black Star about Death's son in the last episode... How much time has passed since then? They clearly imply he died quite a while ago, considering Soul had to ask if Maka even remembers him. Anyway, I have little else to say about it. They spend most of the episode just fighting Sid the zombie. Not very riveting)

**5. Shape of the Soul – Enter the Ultimate Meister Stein? - 3/5** (Frankenstein? His name is literally Franken Stein? That's a little too on the nose, isn't it? That said, I thought he was a pretty amusing character. I think he has a really cool design, even though it's just a generic guy with stitches on his body. But I do think the giant screw on his head a pretty unique attire. I was hoping for the show to be a little more serious, so I was a bit disappointed when they built him approaching the duos in his chair as if something really bad was gonna happen, but then he just falls over. That said, I found it extremely funny when he wanted to re-do it, but just fell over again. So, still a win.

Most of the episode is just spent fighting him, with pauses for some boring dialogue in between. It was disappointing because I thought the fact that he was such a skilled fighter that he still sits in his swivel chair while battling to be really cool[.](https://i.imgur.com/m8KR5Yi.png) Too bad it doesn't last too long, as he stands up eventually. But for the brief 2 scenes, that was badass. And then some very random ""emotional""(?) moment happened with Maka, as she was supposedly traumatized by Stein's soul, only to get back on her feet after a pep talk from Soul. Well, OK then. I just... Don't have enough context or built up investment in the characters for that to work at this time. Also, the way Stein incapacitated Black Star was WAY too brutal for that NOT to be fatal... His head dropped on the ground with blood splattered from it, for crying out loud!)

**6. The New Student – Kid's First Day at the Academy, Will It Be an Entrance to Remember? - 3/5** (I was going to question how Death the Kid wouldn't get upset over the fact that, even though the candles have burnt evently, the melt pattern would likely not be the same, thus not symmetrical. But upon looking at the scene, they ARE symmetrical. So, now my question instead becomes: HOW could they melt perfectly identical??!!?

Anyway, this episode is just Black Star fighting Death the Kid. Yawn. Perhaps I will appreciate these episodes later on, as I would be more invested in the series and retrospectively enjoy the characters early adventures more. But as it stands, I'm getting a little sick of every episode just being characters fighting some guy in the same place for half of it. At least in this instance, it's two main characters against each other. But it still wasn't, like, awesome or anything. But it's slightly more interesting than usual. I did find Black Star yelling like a tough guy from so far away he can't even be heard quite funny, at least.

Also, did Maka and Soul have a fight or something? In the end, she approaches him and they make up. Soul apologizes, and they agree to ""stay cool"". What??? This was literally NEVER said in the episode. Sure, we saw Tsubaki remembering... Or... Imagining? Black Star telling her that he and Soul will be partners now instead. No matter if that was real or imaginary, it was something Maka clearly had no knowledge of, as she jokes about the fact that they should be partners when Tsubaki is worried about it. So, I repeat: WHAT???)

**7. Black-blooded Terror – There's a Weapon inside Crona? - 3/5** (Oh, wow, they're straight up in Italy? I was just a bit surprised, as the show is set in such a different and magical world. I didn't expect normal, real life countries to be in it.

Anyway, Crona is a pretty wacky character. In a good way. His insane rambling and mellow nature was pretty eerie. He seems so out of it. He's obviously just some innocent victim being used. He's particularly interesting during the close-up of his eyes where he talks to himself. He keeps yapping about how the doors only open inward, and he's so nonchalant about the fight. Like, what's going on in this guy's mind? Is he okay?? A character I'm at least slightly more curious to see more of. Also, I thought he was a girl at first. Still, this episode continues having the same issues as the others. The main characters meet someone evil, and then fight them for the latter half. YAWN!!!! Like, an episode in Italy where they track down an evil soul hunter who they can't ever seem to catch up to would be interesting. Instead, we don't even see the challenge. They just complete that goal immediately, and then Crona shows up as the real threat)

**8. The Witch Medusa – Bearer of the Great Terrible Soul? - 3/5** (More fighting Crona... Look, I'm not saying any of the fighting is bad. It all still looks great, but... I don't really watch stories to be mesmerized by good fights. I watch them to engage myself in a good story. Good, elongated battles should be more sprinkled out between story. If there's no interesting story, the fights are meaningless. Like, the ending of this episode is more interesting than anything, cause it feels like something is actually happening rather than dragging out a fight.

Soul getting seriously injured and Maka being devastated by it is great stuff. I found the scene where she checks up on him in the hospital pretty sweet. Real emotional. It's too bad Black Star rushed in and ruined the moment. But to be fair, that was also actually funny. And also, it does feel like some actual story is kicking in here, since Medusa was the witch who was observing the battle and clearly controlling Crona, and she appears as a nurse with the main characters in the end.

Side note: Crona screaming while spikes were popping out of him looked pretty damn painful. And every character is just talking during it. Lol)

**9. Legend of the Holy Sword – Kid and Black☆Star's Great Adventure? - 3/5** (Black Star and Death the Kid is a decent duo to explore. But there's not much of a story. They search for and find Excalibur, realizes he's annoying, and leave. I did find it funny how when they asked a fairy for Excalibur's location, she just cringed and flew away. And as they leave after having met Excalibur, they give her the same expression when she asks if they met him.

The scene where Maka talks with her father gave me some decent lore information I should probably remember. So, apparently, consuming too many human souls is what turns a person into a Kishin, not just ""being evil"". And I learn Ragnarök is just a demon weapon who was melted down by a witch into a black liquid, still alive, who can use weapon meisters by entering their bloodstream. The magic of this show is pretty wacky. And now we know that Soul has a bit of that black liquid inside of him, so, something will be happening there. Eagerly awaiting. I just hope these slight hints at future plots will lead to something better than just ""lets fight someone for half the episode!"". But even so far, I don't find Medusa or Ragnarök very interesting. Just some generic bad guys.

Maka's father acknowledging that the sun is nearly falling asleep was pretty jarring. And hilarious. I didn't think the characters would ever mention the fact that the sun or moon have a face. And how is it a lame topic? That seems like a pretty damn interesting topic to discuss. It would be terrifying. I also find it pretty amusing that the sun is nearly falling asleep, because it's sunset. I guess that's when he goes to bed)

**10. The Enchanted Sword Masamune – Break the Soul Possession: A Heart Sings in the Rain? - 3/5** (Once again it's an episode where the first half is spent looking for a bad guy, and the latter half is spent fighting him. It's so barebones that there's barely anything to comment on. Sure, Black Star tells a little about his family history. Something that would have been much more interesting to see explored on-screen as opposed to telling the story in a tree. And we find out about Tsubaki's family too. Well, only her brother. Who is the Enchanted Sword. Cool. I guess? It's just, these are the two least interesing characters in the show. And Black Star is incredibly annoying. So it doesn't feel earned or genuine enough when he has a ""deep"" talk with Tsubaki)

**11. Tsubaki, the Camellia Blossom – What Lies Beyond the Grief? - 4/5** (So this episode is ""building"" (if you can even call it that) on something revealed at the end of the last episode; That Masamune is Tsubaki's brother, and they're gonna fight. Something that did not even really hold any weight on it's own. Like, I know absolutely zilch about this guy, or his connection to Tsubaki, other than being siblings. Yet I'm supposed to be invested in the fight? Sure, there's one brief flashback in the middle of the fight that gives me some more insight, but I just think... Wouldn't it be better to have that in the previous episode? Hell, have a few more flashbacks of Tsubaki and Masamune in the last episode, but have them be vague. Brief clips here and there of Tsubaki with an older boy, bonding. Don't mention that they're siblings. It would make the reveal of the Enchanted Sword's face and Tsubaki greeting him with ""brother"" at the end have way more weight, and give us a better reason to be invested in the fight THIS episode.

Don't just throw ONE flashaback in the middle. But mostly, don't just have STEIN FRICKING EXPLAIN THEIR HISTORY TOGETHER. Instead of that, following my idea for the previous episode, why not begin the cold opening for this one with a brief flashback showing us everything Stein expositions? This just started with a recap anyway. Like, ever heard of ""show, don't tell""? I guess not, because for every important reveal or story progression, they just cut to all the other characters in the Death Room explaining EVERYTHING. ""Black Star doesn't know the sword is her brother"" ""They're locked in soul battle"" ""Tsubaki is strong because of the love and support from Black Star blablabla"" I UNDERSTAND THIS STUFF FROM WATCHING THE DAMN STORY!!!! Quit wasting time having irrelevant character just stand aroud explaining it!

Negative stuff aside, I really did love the flashback of how Tsubaki met Black Star. It was funny and sweet. I also liked that he was just sitting there by her side, even though people were beating him with a stick. And briefly appearing in her flashback/memory/soul battle... Thingy. All these things told me perfectly how genuine their soul bond is, and how Black Star just being there is enough. I didn't NEED Soul to explain it to me. That said, these things kind of make my criticism of how they're the most boring characters in the last episode a little redudant, since it does improve them. Especially that sweet ending. Plus, I thought it was funny when Black Star finally snapped at the guy beating him)

**12. Courage That Beats Out Fear – Maka Albarn's Great Resolution? - 3/5** (Okay, some more lore in this one. There's a secret witch society? That's... Kind of interesting, but a little generic. So witches are considered evil and are to be hunted down just like the Kishin? Alright then. Also, Medusa sticking her fingers in those two witches mouths was kinda nasty. Did I really need to see the saliva dripping as she pulled her fingers out?

The ""battle"" in this episode is really fricking stupid. Once again, too much tell, not enough show. Instead of seeing more of the two witches who have it out for Medusa, they just appear in an alley to attack her, but then go on to explain every single detail of what they're going to do, why they can't normally beat her, but can now, HOW they can, and why she cannot fight back. Like, OK? I know that's for the audience, but it just comes off as dumb since Medusa herself would know all of this. And it's time wasted that could just be spent attacking. The way Medusa pwnd them anyway was pretty crazy, though. Even destroying one of them from the inside with snakes. Yikes.

Something I just thought about in this episode is; Why is the not-witch cat lady living with Soul and Maka?? Also, I thought Maka's mini-plot was kinda sweet in this)

**13. The Man with the Magic Eye – Soul and Maka's Diverging Soul Wavelength? - 3/5** (""The man with the magic eye"" is kinda hilarious. They built him up to be this dangerous prisoner, but he's so goofy. I loled at the fact that he was gonna Shawshank his way out of prison, but couldn't because he only got chopsticks instead of spoons. He's far too silly to be taken seriously at all, but I don't mind. Side note, he's supposed to be a werewolf, but the face of his wolf form looks more like a shark.

More instances of ""tell, don't show"" except in reality, they both tell AND show. The telling is so unnecessary. Yes, Tsubaki, I KNOW Soul and Maka's soul wavelengths is weakened. I understood that from the fact that it's their plot in the entire episode????)

**14. The Super Written Exam – Heart-Pounding, Reeling, and Restless. You're Kidding!? - 4/5** (This was a really funny episode. No real plot to comment on, it's just a series of funny sequences. So best I can do is pinpoint the funniest moments.

\-Spirit Albarn sending Maka ""positive energy"" and Steins reaction. LOL.

\-Death the Kid desperately wanting to pluck Elazabeth's eyebrows but then just working on the blueprint for three days straight.

\-Also him writing his name.

\-Black Star signing his autograph in blood. Soul got trolled. LOL.

\-That ending. The creepiest misunderstanding ever. I feel bad for Albarn. He's clearly just trying to be a good dad. Look at his silly face in the end. He's so happy! He doesn't even know what the not-witch cat lady actually gave Maka)

**15. The Soul Eating Black Dragon – Scaredy-cat Liz and Her Merry Friends? - 5/5** (I was immediately hooked from the moment they revealed that there was a giant bite taken out of a cliff. Quite the interesting setup... We find out it was a boat that took the bite, but, that bite was way too large for the boat to possibly have taken. Also, the boat looks pretty cool/creepy, with the planks at the front being like an open mouth, and the eyelids being pulled up.

I'm not gonna question the logic of how some guy can magically control a boat, because by now I've understood this show is kinda full off nonsense magic. I didn't find the bad guy particularly interesting, but that's fine because he's not even the focus or highlight of the episode. This episode actually tells an interesting story with good buildup. First the bite, then Kid actually investigating a little. You were lead to believe there was a dragon... But it's a boat. A creepy boat. That's an interesting setting! And on the boat is a room full of collected human souls. That just makes me wonder what the hecks going on here. Exactly as it should.

Liz getting lost and being on her own was the highlight of the episode, actually. She was pretty funny. At least visually. She's VERY physically expressive with her body, and all that just looks hilarious. Especially that VERY long pause as she was just staring at the ghost. I wasn't sure if should have expected her to scream and run off after it, or simply have calmned down. But the fast af crawl towards the camera kinda got a chuckle out of me. Although her constant squealing got a TAD annoying after a while. Mostly because it just goes ON AND ON. But that's probably why the silent pause was so much funnier. Also, they squeezed in some random backstory of how she and her sister met Death the Kid as she's walking. Very random.

Death the Kid refusing to use Patty as a weapon due to lack of summetry was funny too, but it has me wondering... Why couldn't he just use one gun and hold it with both hands at the center of his body? Also speaking of Patty, at first I thought she was just a typical ditzy girl... But I'm starting to believe she's just straight up r-worded. I mean I thought that when she was drawing with crayons during a test in the last episode. But in this one she's reading picture books for toddlers, and happily banging on the floor that her sister just fell down from??

This episode actually gets an ending perfectly right, too. It helps that the rest of it was good, obviously. But ending on Kid finally being ready to fight, only for CRONA to appear and take down the bad guy? Wack! Haven't even mentioned the bad guy, because he wasn't even that interesting. Everything else was!)

**16. Fierce Battle Aboard the Ghost Ship – The Hell inside My Head? - 3/5** (That wasn't exactly the battle I was expecting. Crona just runs away and Kid stops chasing them to admire the symmetry of the sky. I liked Stein and Sid both being onto Medusa as a witch, and the way they go on about it. So why is it only half the episode? Should've been more. I liked the way Medusa got out of the accusation by claiming Stein was just insulting her. And his reaction afterwards got a chuckle out of me too. Sid and the other woman investigating was interesting, but way too brief)

**17. Legend of the Holy Sword 2 – Wanna Go Drinking, Gambling, and Playing? - 2/5** (Excalibur is kind of a funny character. I say ""kind of"" because he's not like, slap my knee hilarious. But it was amusing enough to see him ramble. But it went on for a little too long, and I didn't find his flashbacks very funny. One thing I did find extremely funny was the bartender just absolutely going NUTS mixing a drink though. LOL[.](https://i.imgur.com/l9ZvNMM.png)

I also wonder what the hell Excalibur even is. He's just... A short little white guy with a giant nose, and no mouth? And I was under the impression that he's been sitting there, waiting for a meister for quite a while. But this episode clearly tells us he's been out and about in the world during various decades)

**18. The Eve Party Nightmare – And so the Curtain Rises? - 3/5** (Medusa's big plan is finally kicking in. Well, THAT was fast. I was expecting a lot more mystery, but nope. Here it is. And, uh... It feels way too early, because I barely think Medusa is an interesting character. She was more interesting in the shadows. I was hoping the secret plot would kind of go on for a little longer than this. And was Stein genuinely considering joining her as they were dancing?)

**19. The Underground Battle Commences – Break Through Medusa's Vector Arrow? - 3/5** (The big battle with Medusa and her crew is indeed commencing and... Wow, I sure have little to say about it. Grim Reaper gives us some lore in the beginning, Stein goes over the plan, and then they begin the plan. That said, really like the action in the episode. And the fact that all the characters actually managed to get past Medusa. LOL. Owned. And Stein (brielfy) owns her in battle too)

**20. The Black Blood Resonance Battle! – A Small Soul's Grand Struggle against Fear? - 3/5** (Aaaaaand the plot continues. I'm just not that invested in it to have a lot to say. It's just Maka vs. Crona for the most part. Guess I'll have to wait till the next one to see what Kid and Black Star are doing. The reveal that Crona is Medusa's son sure was... A reveal. I guess I liked his flashback. It was okay. Although Maka letting the ""black blood"" take over her body via, uh, soul wavelengths with Soul (kind of nonsense magic) was a bit more interesting. She immediately displays the same wacky behavior that Crona does. So I guess it's just the corruption of the black blood that makes Crona act the nutty way he does. But, the black blood is Ragnarök. Who is a person. That's how he controls Crona. Why is it affecting Soul's mind by giving him images of a small little devil man? And why does ""accepting"" it make you go insane? There's no Ragnarök inside Soul to controlling him. Nor Maka)

**21. May My Soul Reach You – A Dry Heart inside Unbearable Isolation? - 4/5** (Crona and Maka's insanity battle is, well, insane. Maka just goes absolutely brutal, especially the way she repeatedly smacks Crona's head against a pillar. It was really cool. Way better than when we spent an entire episode of them fighting here. Although I don't understand the logic of the black blood madness at all. At first, I thought it was only Ragnarök who WAS the black blood, but I guess you can also take some of the blood and it functions like a disease that make you go insane. But they're not actually in control of their bodies? Because Maka's soul, aka her non-insane consciousness is like, alive in some sort of spirit realm, where she's connected to souls around her, and she visits Crona's soul, who's talking to his own shadow? I... Huh?

Don't get me wrong, I actually really liked the scene. I thought it was really interesting, and I understood the impact it has on the story and the emotional beats it's supposed to hit for Crona. I simply don't get what's actually physically happening when we see all of this. Is it just an imaginary illusion? A representation of what's happening? Soul literally has to physically PULL Maka out of the madness water to... Make her sane in the real world. Am I thinking about this too much? Probably.

I thought this was a great episode for Crona. That ending was really powerful, and I like how they even changed the credits to have him walking alongside Maka. Also, Blaire vs the 5 mouse witches (formed into a sexy woman??) was just cringe. Please, just stop with these types of scenes)

**22. The Seal Shrine – The Immortal Man's Tricks? - 4/5** (Ragnarök is smaller now because Crona is more mentally in control over his own body and soul, I guess? It's still pretty annoying to have a guy that's able to spawn from your veins and beat you, even if he is smaller.

I thought The Man With the Magic Eye's (I'm not calling him ""Free"", that's dumb) trick was pretty clever, but it's still pretty silly that after being found out as a projection, he just starts explaining the exact details of his trick. And Kid + Black Star just stand there listening. Like, uh, weren't you in a rush to catch up? Weren't you upset that the trick wasted time? WHY ARE YOU STANDING THERE LISTENING TO IT AND CONGRATULATING HIM?! JUST RUN! Also, I found it pretty amusing that Kid was able to get his focus back on the Man simply because Patty/Liz pointed out he only has a ball and chain on one leg.

The madness illusions that Erica and The Man With the Magic Eye suffered were fricking brutal. Erica's face being bitten off is horrifying. I was not expecting that)

**23. Dead or Alive – In the Rift between Revival and Dazzlement? - 3/5** (Stein is able to get the upper hand against Medusa because... He calmed down and realized... He's insane? I'm kind of torn on Stein as a character because of this, though. He seems like a really likable guy, but, is it implied he's literally killed people in the past just to dissect them?

I was genuinely so satisfied when Black Star destroyed the syringe containing black blood. I thought it was kind of an easy win, but cool nonetheless. I was genuinely not expecting that to be a fakeout and that he actually cut the Kishin sack. And speaking of, that Kishin is fricking horrifying. It's moving around inside the sack of skin and it looks so disgusting. Even worse with how inhuman it's moving too. Just creates a more eerie feeling about it. Like what's up with frantically dragging it's fingers over the wooden floor and then banging on it with one hand? Really makes me wonder what horrors they've just awoken)

**24. The Battle of the Gods – Death City on the Verge of Collapse? - 5/5** (Maka and Soul has missed most of the important action. Lol. And the Kishin manages to look even more creepy than in the previous episode. I found it extremely funny the way he casually walks up to Erica and rubs his eyes like a guy who just woke up from a nap. He doesn't look evil at all, just confused and tired... And then he fucking screams. That really caught me off guard. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be funny, but I laughed.

Oh, yeah, the battle between the two sexy witches (well, the cat is still supposedly NOT a witch) was happening. I was wondering if they'd just forget about it, but, here it is. Thank goodness they didn't focus on it a lot. Because what follows is genuinely epic. The Grim Reaper himself vs the Kishin. That. Was. BADASS. He actually makes an angry expression with his face and drops the silly voice to truly Get Serious. It really shows how serious of a threat this is going to be. And the fight was EPIC. Despite that, he's still very cheery and hopeful in the ending. I still find it very amusing that the literal Grim Reaper in this show is such a silly guy.

The slow reveal of his entrance was really cool too, but I found it more amusing to point out that Erica says the shield has been up for only 40 minutes, but it's been 7 episodes at this point. Granted, only halfway through the one where they put it up, and it's down halfway through this. So, about the length of 6 episodes. But that's still roughly 120 minutes, not 40. LOL)

**25. The Death Scythes Convene – Stop Dad's Staff Reassignment!? - 4/5** (Death's silly demeanor continues to amuse me. Like the way he sometimes won't answer questions and just goes ""hmmhmhmmhmh..."". Anyway, this is a nice little slow episode to have after the lengthy adventure the characters were just on. It's just the Death Scythes gathering to plan ahead for catching the Kishin, and the students playing basketball. The former of which was more interesting, though. I'm introduced to three new characters, but they all seem kind of one note. And I can feel the woman constantly complaining about wanting a husband is going to get annoying real quick. It already wasn't very funny when she was talking about marrying a toilet.

I thought it was an amusing visual that one of the Death Scythes had earbuds designed after Death's mask. Also, Spirit getting a W in the end if this episode is extremely wholesome. I'm just so happy for the guy. He's literally filled with joy over the fact that his daughter simply wants to spend time with him. I don't care if she's only asking him cause she lost a game. He deserves that W.

I also enjoyed the light teasing for future stories. They're gonna enroll Crona in the academy, and Spirit is spying on Stein to keep him in check so he doesn't go mad. I sort of think he will, and he's gonna become evil)",1b0r63v,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/souleater/comments/1b0r63v/soul_eater_reviewed_episode_1_25/,[]
AUTOMATON SPACESHIPS ARE COMING! You can see low detail versions of them in Popli IX missions. I've seen them get shot down and exchange fire with low detail versions of Super Destroyers!

Helldivers 2 x Alien Crossover,"In my mind this would be the perfect crossover event.

It's almost like all our weapons and stratagems were specifically made to kill Xenomorphs.

We have explosive element Guns, flamethrowers, orbital lasers, gun turrets, 500kg bombs and so much else, made to handle huge swarms of enemies.

Imagine if the event started with us on our ship, hearing rumors on the mission board about a crashed vessel, somewhere in our Super Earth controlled space system.

Helldivers drop down on the planet to investigate, only to find out that the planet have been infested and overrun by this new, mysterious threat.

Chaos ensues and multiple SOS beacons are sent out, prompting more Helldivers to help their Comrades.

I loved playing Aliens:Fireteam Elite and this would be like a dream come true if we had an event like this in Helldivers 2.

Imagine having to survive and extract when swarms of Xenomorphs come from every direction, led by an enraged Queen that comes out after we blow up enough nests.

Xenomorphs could even infect the bugs we are allready fighting, creating a bug type Xenomorph.

This was just an idea of mine and I know it will probably never happen.

Any thoughts?

Fullmetal Alchemist Reviewed: Episode 36 - 51,"**36. The Sinner Within - 3/5** (Winry coming to the rescue in a tractor is awesome. And Edward finally meets some military personnel again. I've been wondering how he is just able to wander off for days, maybe even weeks with no notice of where he's gone. He has a job, and it's to be stationed where he is demanded so that he can be given orders whenever a superior commands it. But he just casually meets up with Riza, gives some insight into Yoki's death, and leaves again. Doesn't seem like a very reliable soldier, is all.

I get that Ishbalans are supposed to be a bit underdeveloped but I still find it ridiculous how instantly the two Ishbalan boys switches their minds about Scar just because he's an ""exhile"". Exhiled for practicing alchemy, which Edward and Alphonse does, something which they don't seem to take issue with. I know Ed and Al aren't part of their ""people"", but like, shouldn't they still see them as evil?

At least there's relief that we found out Mustang didn't really fry a bunch of refugees some episodes ago, just made a wall of flame around them. Also, Winry decides to return to Central on a whim because she figured out Mustang killed her parents... What exactly is her plan? To yell at him?)

**37. The Flame Alchemist, The Bachelor Lieutenant & The Mystery of Warehouse 13 - 5/5** (Okay, this was a hilarious episode. It's so random. The whole show has been about Edward and Alphonse's journey and evil villains lurking in the background. But for the first time, here's just a comedic episode starring Colonel Mustang and his subordinates in their daily lives.

There's not even a consistent plot to it, it's just a random series of events. And very silly ones, too. Being ordered by the Colonel to... Find one of his men a girlfriend? Lol. Havoc's entire interaction with Armstrong's family was so hilarious, it would be futile for me to list every funny moment in it. All his imaginations about Armstrong's sister were gold. His locked silly facial expression for the rest of the episode was great too.

The haunted wearhouse part was probably the least best, but it was still so ridiculous I found it humorous regardless. When the least best part is still awesome, you know it's a great episode. And it leads to the best part of the episode... Mustang a tiny bone buried and assuming there's been a murder within their station, only to find out it was Hawkeye's dog who's burying them.

I would honestly love an episodic show about these characters lives in the military if every episode would be as good and funny as this. But it DOES make me wonder... What do these guys even DO? We see them sent off to missions every now and then, but when they're not on missions, do they just come into the office and sit there for the entire day? Cause they sure didn't do any important military work in this episode! Also, it was nice to see Mustang visit Hughes' widowed wife. I guess Winry is staying with her? I didn't think she knew them that well, she just stayed with Hughes brielfy, but I guess she has nowhere else to stay in Central City)

**38. With the River's Flow - 5/5** (LOL @ Edward's friz. This episode had a lot of interesting events and dynamics. Firstly, seeing Edward and Alphonse get in a fight is surprising. They have the closest bond between brothers I've ever seen. Them fighting each other with alchemy and ruining the entire road in the process was amusing. But I've gotta side with Alphonse on this one. It's true, Edward really is reckless. On the other hand, HOW would they even contact their dad like Alphonse suggests?

I like how the fight resulted in a really sweet moment too. Mimicing their fights from when they were kids, by Edward still finding Alphonse sitting by a river. And not even properly making up, just saying ""let's go"" and moving on. Truly an unspoken bond. But also, when he was sitting by the river and mindlessly transmuting some miniature things like a horse or a car out of the ground (which was oddly sad/adorable) why did he also transmute... A pile of poop? I laughed at that when I noticed it. Second, Alphonse being ""friends"" with a woman who helped kidnap him not long ago is pretty wacky.

And lastly, Winry teaming up with Sheska to investigate Hughes' murder was awesome. They worked really well as a duo. I hope to see more of it. Sheska alone is such a great and wholesome character. It's sweet how attached she got to Hughes, and how she's secretly researching the exact same thing that got him killed in the first place. At least she's not doing it on authority, which was Hughes' mistake[.](https://i.imgur.com/MUyFuCD.png) Also, Winry's face when seeing Sloth, and realizing it's Trisha Elric, was bizarre)

**39. Secret of Ishbal - 3/5** (Some truths about the war in Ishbal revealed. When the plot covers such grand stories, I get very easily confused. And I know that's likely because I don't have context of the whole series, where all these things are explained. It's much easier to follow when it's all from Ed and Al's perspective in their small-scale stories with slow reveals. Roy's group are going to a military base close to Liore to capture Scar, but with Kimblee and Archer being all mysterious and the latter's secret chimera chamber, something else is clearly going on.

That said, I really like how this episode ends with Edward looking up to see Scar holding his shoulder. Heart rate rising. Also, Ed in a bad brown wig... Lol. Also, also, is everyone still not gonna tell Ed and Al about Hughes being dead? At this point they'll be even more pissed when they find out)

**40. The Scar - 4/5** (Alphonse doesn't want anyone to get killed. So instead of letting Marta kill Kimblee, a very bad man, he stops her so that Kimblee can instead kill a random soldier, probably not a very bad man. One person would have died either way, might as well have been the evil one... I know Alphonse couldn't have known that, but his righteousness always backfire like this. Alphonse vs. Kimblee is awesome, though! Love how Mustang walked in and didn't even mind that Alphonse beat him up.

Anyway, we FINALLY get to see Scar's brothers full backstory... And it's... Literally everything that's already been passively told to us. Not much of a reveal. That's not to say I didn't like the flashbacks. I especially enjoyed the scene that tells how Scar got his famous scar, and his brother's arm. Kimblee is just... Brutal in that scene. What a psycho. Also, why is Lust white if the woman she spawned from is brown?

Marta finds out Bradley is a homunculus? Yeah, she's dead. There's no doubt about it. I knew she was dead the moment he showed her his ultimate eye. Alphonse seemed to stand pretty passively as Bradley put his sword into the armor very slowly... But I digress, because that was a REALLY powerful scene. Especially when you see blood seeping out from the armor. Yikes. Traumatizing. So, uh, is that Rose's own baby she's carrying around? Who's the father? When did THIS happen? Last we saw she was struggling to protect people during the military attack, and she was not pregnant.

Trivial thought: Edward taking a break from fighting Scar to explain to him that he's changing the material of his arm to prevent him from destroying it was already ridiculous, as there's no reason to tell him that, just keep fighting... But it gets even dumber when he adds a ""BUT"" to explain the weakness it gives him. LOL. Really?? He also mentions that incident with Nina happened 4 years ago. And given Rose has had a baby since we last saw her, more time has passed than I thought)

**41. Holy Mother - 3/5** (Why the extended scene of Marta telling Alphonse what she saw? Why wasn't this included in the last episodes ending? I thought it was pretty obvious she told him everything. We just didn't see it.

Scar talks a lot about ""turning"" his arm into a philosopher's stone. But the way it functions, it seems to me that it already is one? Just not in the form of a stone. Anyway, while it's still conflicting on if I'm supposed to root for Scar or not, allowing him to impale and kill Kimblee was SO satisfying. I wasn't expecting it. But when it happened, I was like ""YES, FINALLY!!!"". Of course he didn't die, so... Yeah.

Those were some really detailed still shots of Edward, Rose and Wrath in the end. Nice)

**42. His Name is Unknown - 4/5** (Oh, I guess Kimblee does die. Just had enough strength left to turn Al into a bomb then dip. Anyway, Scar's goals seem to change every single episode. First he was killing state alchemists, then he wanted to sacrifice soldiers to create a philosopher stone, and now he IMMEDIATELY changed his mind just to help Alphonse. How nice of him, I guess? But that was a pretty sudden change of heart. He does say it's because he understands the love the Elric brothers share, much like the love he shared with his own late brother. But, still... Every person he hurts could have a brother. Also, even though it's actually pretty horrifying to experience, him running around with both arms gone just looks goofy. And then he dies. RIP.

This was a VERY climactic episode though. It's the end of Scar's journey, and it features the actual creation of a philosopher's stone... And it's inside of Alphonse! I really like how Lust just stands there and warns them, because she can't attack due to Al having a locket from the person she was made from)

**43. The Stray Dog - 4/5** (So, the famed Hohenheim finally returns. He comes back to Resembol only to... Sit around and be depressed and mysterious. That's it? Sheska and Winry somehow becoming a duo is still fun, but at this point in the story, they just want to tell Ed and Al information that they already know. Lol.

Most of the episode is spent with the military, mostly Mustang and his men, chasing down Edward. It is a bit of an interesting conflict, since they obviously don't want to. The fights aren't particularly ""epic"" which makes sense as no one wants to hurt each other. But they're still fun to watch. I mean Havoc shooting his gun into Edward's hand and injuring himself was... Well I don't wanna say ""cool"", as that must've hurt, but, an interesting event. And Edward using alchemy to inflate two of them like balloons... Uh[,](https://i.imgur.com/IyUuIBk.png) that's a little silly for this show, isn't it?

I found it kind of cheap that Alphonse being unable to be in water cause of his blood seal is a plotpoint that has literally NEVER been mentioned until now, the very episode where it will became relevant a few minutes later. I prefer storytelling that hints these things earlier on to make the reveal better. Not that this was a particularly deep aspect of the show, so, no loss.

It's nice that Roy cares about the Elrics. His behavior rarely implies it, but his actions show it... Well, NOW anyway. In a way earlier episode, Hughes said he hid the dangers the brothers had gotten themselves into because he was afraid Mustang would step in and do something stupid because he cares about them, which at the time definitely didn't feel like the case)

**44. Hohenheim of Light - 4/5** (LYRA is leading the homunculi??!? Well, okay, this is a stupid question because as I'm writing this I've obviously finished the episode and know that she is actually Dante who has transferred her soul into Lyra's body. So, Lyra is dead. But at the start I thought it was pretty crazy and nonsensical that some bit character from ONE episode early on, who showed up WAY later only as a maid turned out to be the main villain. This assumption would be wrong, of course.

Still, the fact that she (or someone in her body, as known now) would be the villain was pretty obvious, since she's prominently featured in the opening. Hohenheim creating a bunch of transparent (water?) Alphonse armors at the end to briefly fight Dante's monsters was cool, but I'm not really sure what the point of it was.

Holy moly so many characters from various individual plotlines are being condensed into the Rockbell house now. I guess it's neatly tying everything together, closing in on the end. But it's definitely overwhelming. Ed and Al FINALLY find out about Hughes, at least. Edward reacts just about how I'd expect)

**45. A Rotted Heart - 4/5** (Dante being an alchemist who transfers her soul to new bodies every few decades and used to be in love with Hohenheim is definitely a twist I did not expect. I knew the former from the previous episode, but not the latter. Although Hohenheim is supposed to actually be a stand-up guy, is he not? I don't imagine he would so easily kill people just to steal their bodies. But the body he's in now is clearly not the one Dante put him into 400 years ago. So, who is THIS? The body he's in now actually resembles the one from the flashback he was originally in, so... Huh?

The episode teases about what's behind the gate, as Dante kills(?) Hohenheim by forcing him through it. Some interesting lore about it is established too. It's a lot more spiritual than scientific. Every human is connected to the gate, but young ones have a stronger connection? To me, that sounds like the gate is somewhere souls are before they're born into humans, and perhaps where they return in the afterlife. I mean we do know, thanks to Wrath, that that's where homunculi come from. So, what, are they souls who have been unnaturally ripped from the gate, as opposed to reborn?

Also, for such a serious, lore-, reveal- and plot heavy episode, the scene where Winry and Sheska argue about baking really sticks out as odd)

**46. Human Transmutation - 4/5** (Wow, Archer is alive? Now this has me curious. All we ever saw was a shot of him in bandages screaming in pain. I eagerly await his inevitable return. But for now, I'm enjoying Lust betryaing Dante and the homunculi to aid Edward in his goal. Obviously for her own gain. But still, this is a shocking, but very welcome, development. She's probably been the most interesting homunculi to follow. She's the only one who actually seems to care about her past and her creation. And really the only one who has shown any desire to become ""human"".

Edward asks her the same question I've had for ages about WHY she'd want to become human when she's basically superior to a human in every way. Apparently it's the ""same"" as the reason Alphonse wants his body back, except... I don't accept that answer. Alphonse can't blend in with society. He can't enjoy the simple pleasures of life. He can't taste food, feel physical affection, or sleep. Lust can do all of that. She looks like a human. There's no reason she can't just live her life. And if being MORTAL is the only reason, she can just end her own life when she feels fulfilled by it, after having had friends and family for a couple of decades. I know that's a bit stupid to say since it's preferable to die naturally than at your own hands.

Tucker's storyline is not nearly as interesting as everything else going on. We already know his attempt to bring back Nina is futile. Still, even though what he did to Nina all those years ago was MESSED UP, he... Doesn't really seem like a bad guy anymore? Also, Hohenheim created Envy??? Well, NOW his comment about Edward having ""HIS blood in you"" makes sense)

**47. Sealing the Homunculus - 4/5** (HOOOOLY HELL ALPHONSE IS STUPID IN THIS WHOLE EPISODE!!! For crying out loud, SLOTH IS NOT YOUR MOTHER! There was a perfect opportunity for Edward to end her life and get rid of yet another homunculus from chasing and tormenting you, and you STOP him? Alphonse is naive, forgiving, and loves his mother. I get that. But I figured he would be more logical at this point.

Even after he saves her, she keeps being evil and when Edward finally gets the opportunity to end her again, Alphonse still seem... Reluctant. But at least he let Ed finish the job this time. Even if he didn't like it. The animation of her water reshaping itself into her body was really smooth... And freaky, because of how distorted her face becomes for a few frames.

Also, yeah, of course Wrath's not dead. I really don't understand his plot about seeing Sloth as his mother, though. When he was unconscious and ""dreamed""(?) of the gate, he saw Izumi and ran up and hug her, but it turned out to be Sloth, who kept swapping between being Izumi and Sloth. Why does that suddenly mean he wants Sloth as his mommy?)

**48. Goodbye - 3/5** (Armstrong bragging about his muscles is always hilarious. Great way to start the episode. Turns out Winry spying on them in the last episode was actually Envy in disguise. I didn't expect that, so, good twist. Although it's a bummer that he just kindaps Alphonse so that he isn't seen for the rest of the episode.

Wrath crying for mommy all the time is honestly getting annoying. Wrath?? He's too much of a crybaby to be wrathful. Also, the Fake Elrics return! I still don't remember their real names, but it was pretty fun to see them again. Watching the older one get arrested for claiming to be Edward again was pretty funny. Though, very concerning when Bradley ordered them executed! I was honestly so relieved when I saw Ross and and Brosh walk by. With the gruesome nature of this show, I was expecting them to just be offed.

The conversation between Mustang and Edward in the car ride was... Nice. It's really just the two reflecting on their actions and the horrors of the series up to this point. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. That was a very eerie goodbye. Makes it sound like they'll never see each other again.

Archer finally makes his return... As a cyborg?? Okay, that's just too wacky for this show. I know this is fiction and stuff like alchemy or automail are already crazy, but at least those have been logically established. I guess the implication is that what Archer has is just automail, but that's not just a prosthetic limb. Half of his body is straight up a robot. He has a glowing red eye, can release a gun from his mouth, and it MAKES ROBOTIC NOISES. How is this just ""automail""? He's a literal cyborg)

**49. The Other Side of the Gate - 4/5** (7,000 SOLDIERS DIED TO MAKE THE PHILOSOPHER STONE IN LIORE?!?!? From what they showed us of the invasion, I did not expect 7,000. Maybe a couple of hundred, at most.

This episode has some really wacky shots. Firstly, the underground city being so crammed and distorted is visually neat. But the camera spinning around Edward and Dante while they're talking? That was just jarring. Mostly cause when it isn't panning past the characters, it's just the empty ballroom. BORING! Also, the close-up fisheye shots of the Ed and Dante were also wacky[.](https://i.imgur.com/j4TBhJT.png) Also, during the 360 shot, Edward loudly spells out Dante's entire plan, and Rose is there to hear it. Why is she not at all concerned? Dante straight up admits she's planning to kill Rose to take over her body. And Rose just... Stands there. Not reacting at all!

Their talk about equivalent exchange as a philosophy also grinds my gears because even though Dante is the villain, everything she says is true. I'm agreeing with the bad guy and think the protagonist is stupid! I've said this before, but equivalent exchange is the rule for physical matter! It's that you can't just use alchemy to MAKE stuff. You can only reshape the atoms or molecules within something. Like, okay, I GET it. It's also just a philosophy that alchemists like to live by. And that's very respectable. You always give back to those who give to you. But it's naive for Edward to somehow believe that equivalent exchange is true in every case?? Like Dante mentions regarding the people who lost the State Alchemist Exam that he won. It's true. They put in hard work and gained nothing. This shouldn't be a revelation though. Or crush his world view.

Even though Gluttony is one of the villains and, uh, has done truly horrific things, it's kind of sad to see him walk around fretting about where Lust is. Guess they were pretty close friends, moreso than the other homunculi. Still, I can hardly feel actual sadness for him. He's EATEN people)

**50. Death - 5/5** (First cyborgs, now ALTERNATE UNIVERSES? Are they just throwing all the craziest, nonsensical stuff at us in the end for shock value? What's with all the sci-fi shit? And this other universe is apparently just regular London during WWI. Though it is quite amusing to see Edward reacting to ""our"" world. Anyway, they specify that the same people exist parallel to themselves in both universes. But that begs the question... If Amestris-Edward's soul was put into London-Edward's body... Where is London-Edward? There was a brief period where they both seemed to be confused about the situation, and Amestris-Edward acknowledged that he has taken control of someone elses body. So is London-Edward just asleep, or is he aware of everything? Is HIS soul in the gate, since his body is occupied?

Also, what about Hohenheim? He implied his soul didn't transfer body, but that he entered the alternate universe with his current body. So is there not a London-Hohenheim? Or, well, given alchemy doesn't exist here, whoever's body Hohenheim is currently using might still be there, but not as Hohenheim of London, as that guy would've died 400 years ago. But the way we first see Hohenheim, it's implied he's already well acquainted with London-Edward. He acted like a father to him before realizing he was speaking to Amestris-Edward. But that would make no sense if he just arrived there a few days earlier. Did he immediately move in with his estranged son? It's only been a few days, how would you know if London-Edward wasn't ""acting like himself""? I guess it doesn't matter since Amestris-Edward immediately dies in the body of London-Edward and his soul is sent back to Amestris so they don't even bother explaining it.

Speaking of not making any sense, while I know drawing circles to reshape atoms and molecules is already nonsensical magic, the reveal that the power of alchemy in the other world comes from souls in this one is just another level of ""WHAT??"" Is the implication that people here die WHEN a transmutation is performed, or that transmutations just USE energy from souls of dead people here? Because if it's the latter, I don't really see the issue with it. They're already dead, and their energy is just being used naturally. It's also SUPER vague what ""energy"" of a soul even is.

And all this stuff takes away focus from Mustang vs. Bradley. No offense to those guys, but Edward's story is far more interesting. Guess it's come to an end though, since he literally DIES. What. The.)

**51. Laws and Promises - 4/5** (Well, THAT sure was a bittersweet ending. Though calling it sweet is inaccurate. It's TOLD in a happy way, but the context is all depressing. Edward has straight up died and we SEE his soul by the gate. He looks emotionless. I mean, gee, he's a dead spirit. I'd also be lost for words. But Alphonse uses the philosopher stone and sacrifice himself to heal the body and pull him back to it. I was gonna question that for being a human transmutation, but the logic there is pretty soundproof. No different from Edward pulling Alphonse's body into the suit of armor. Only Edward's body was still there so he didn't need to put it in an inanimate object. In that sense, bringing someone back to life clearly IS possible, as long as it's pretty much immediately after they've died. Just pull their soul into any object. Of course you gotta be an advanced enough alchemist and have everything prepared, so, that's just not feasible most of the time. But that kind of defeats the whole idea the show pushes about how death is death and bringing people back to life is supposed to be impossible.

These last few transmutations don't seem to have much logic to them. I can't figure it out. Like, there's no way Alphonse used up the entire philosopher stone just to heal a body and pull a soul back. Edward had to sacrifice an arm to do the latter. The philosophers stone has the energy of thousands of souls. Surely that would be more than enough for both of those actions. But no, it magically sends Alphonse to the gate for some reason. And upon Edward being revived, HE pulls another intricate transmutation to bring ALPHONSE back. Which brings Alphonse back as a 10 year old with no memories of the last few years for some reason, and sends Edward back to the alternate universe... FOR SOME REASON. I like these things as a story, but the logic is really hanging by a thread, and I do like things to at least make some level of sense.

It's just sad knowing that Alphonse forgot everything of the past few years. I'm curious of his reaction to it all. Like, it's IMPLIED people told him, as in the end he goes with Izumi to continue training so he can figure out a way to get back with Edward. But what did he think of what he had been told? Did they really tell him everything? Did he have no reaction at all to everyone being a few years older? Would be especially noticable with Winry, as she was a kid yesterday from his view.

Anyway, Edward and Hohenheim are in Germany for some reason now. I am intrigued by Edward talking about using space travel to reach the gate again, now that alchemy isn't an option. Side note, uh, Bradley killed his on son. Yeah, that was fucked up)

**Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa - 3/5** (It's very nice to start off seeing a classic Ed and Al adventure. It was unironically the best part of the movie. Really just makes it more depressing when we get to the present to see Edward still stick in the universe on the other side of the gate. And I still have questions about this world! It seems every person exists parallel to themselves in both worlds. So what's the explanation for Alphonse Heinrich's existence? He's just Alphonse, but he's NOT London-Edward's brother? Edward implies they just met and became friends, so Alphonse Heinrich clearly didn't know London-Edward. Literally NOTHING about their parental history is explained, so I guess it's POSSIBLE they could've been brothers, just estranged. The Hohenheim (or the guy whos body Amestris-Hohenheim took over) of this world could've had two kids with the Trisha of this world and then get separated. That's the only explanation, because if they're not biological brothers, they'd have different moms and dads, which would not make them grow up to look identical to someone with completely different parents as they'd have a different mix of genes.

Speaking of parallel versions of characters, I did come to like Jewish Bradley. The only Bradley we knew before was a homunculus and a monster. But his demeanor was always so calm and respectful. So to see a Bradley who isn't disguising his true evil self, but is just genuinely a calm and kind-hearted man, was really nice. This is truly a guy I WOULD support as furher.

The movie really fails at making the new characters interesting though. Noah is just a boring plot device and feels like a Rose clone. Why wasn't she just made the Rose parallel? The villain, who's name I don't even remember, was boring as hell. She was not a character I remembered or thought would be THAT vital. In the end, I was like ""Really? SHE'S the final boss?"". Too much storytime is spent on the Nazi revolution too. And due to this, the returning characters get far too little screentime. Mustang has one scene where he's just hidden away from society and moping, but then returns to aid in the final battle. Winry's involvement felt very limited considering she's supposed to be the closest person to Ed and Al after each other. But she's just walking around with Sheska until the finale when it's time to give Edward some new automail. Armstrong is as great as ever though. At least his return in Liore is cheerful. Side note, How did they manage to restore Liore, an entire city, in only 2 years?

There were a lot of characters who's story conclude in this movie, but too little time to make them all stick out. Like Envy. He's a dragon, and gets sacrificed. Cool. Hohenheim dies performing the sacrifice. Cool. Gluttony is a monster... Why? (Side note, Wrath twisting one of Gluttony's necks off was pretty cool. Well, brutal, but a bit of a cool shocking moment). And Izumi has passed... That was really sad to hear, actually. Hope Sig is doing okay on his own. One character who's story conclusion I found mildly more interesting was Wrath. He had basically no lines until the final fight, but he lead Alphonse to a place he can open the gate and be used as a sacrifice to be back with his ""mommy"". Even though Sloth ISN'T his mother, but I've already been over that. But, WHY was Sloth in the gate? And why does she have Izumi's hair? What actually IS in the middle of the gate between worlds? Is it just like I guessed in another episode review, that it's where souls go after (and are, before) death? I thought homunculi didn't have souls!

There was also a side plot about German Hughes and Gracia falling in love... Well, OK then? A bit unnecessary. And German Alphonse died... I really did not get too attached to him. Random note I can't fit in anywhere else: How did they manage to restore Liore, an entire city, in only 2 years?

The ENDING though. Ugh! I'm not hating on it. It's a lot happier than how the final episode concluded. And knowing Edward and Alphonse stay together IS happy. But... They both left behind everyone they know and love for the rest of their lives. What about poor Winry? At least I'm glad that Alphonse actually got his memories back. They bonded so much more than they ever could during those years, so it would be cruel if he didn't. Still, must be pretty weird that Edward is now a whole 5 years older than him instead of just 1. Also, Alphonse going to his alternate self's funeral must've been weird. Look On Down From The Bridge should have played)

**OVA1. Chibi Party** (Every character as a little chibi is adorable. This short was cute and funny. The opening felt very dragged out, though. There's an unnecessarily long shot of nothing but the extras walking, and even when it cuts to Roy and Hawkeye, there's a giant, awkward pause in the middle of the conversation for the extras to keep... Walking. How riveting.

Hawkeye talking about how the movie avoided giving her a romance subplot with Mustang was weird because throughout the series, I never really felt any romantic connection there. It... Always seemed pretty platonic. Also, Alphonse confusing Noah for Rose was pretty ironic, since I made the same comparison in the movie)

**OVA2. Kids** (This one is VERY confusing. So, these three kids, that look EXACTLY like Edward, Alphonse and Winry, have just left the theatre after seeing Conqueror of Shamballa. Pretty evident as they show a huge poster and promotional ads for the movie plastered around town. And they start pretending to perform alchemy on a well cover (Pretty cute btw. Makes me miss being a kid. Sigh).

But then they return to visit Edward. Which, uh, makes no sense if these kids supposedly just... Saw a movie starring him, as a conclusion to the series Fullmetal Alchemist? Unless I'm to believe Edward actually did novelize his tales like Alfons Heiderich suggested, and they ended up getting adapted into the series we know as Fullmetal Alchemist. But even then it's pretty wacky that the kids look exactly like Ed, Al, Win, as well as encountering kid versions of Mustang and his men, and an adult Hughes as a police)

**OVA3. Live Action** (LOL this one is terrible. They just put a giant Alphonse armor in a few places, recorded, and called it a day. He doesn't even move. Every time he's supposed to walk or do something, there's just a cut, and in the next scene, he's changed position)

**OVA4. Alchemists vs. Homunculi** (You know the biggest problem with this? Too much plot, not enough battle. Like, it's just a 10 minute park attraction. Which, by the way, is confusing to me as it's just a video. Is the attraction just... Playing this video at the park? How riveting. But, given it's nature, there's too much time spent on having plot at all. It would've just been cool to see all homunculi and iconic State Alchemists duke it out for 10 minutes. Would also have been vastly better if the whole thing was done from the POV of one alchemist instead of just a few shots. Makes it really jarring. Also, Kimblee and Archer (evil) being part of the good guys gave me a good laugh)",1b0quk4,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ParticularlyAvocado/comments/1b0quk4/fullmetal_alchemist_reviewed_episode_36_51/,[]

[Excerpt: Endeavor of Will] Void warfare with a Iron Warriors ship,"*Context:*

*An Iron Warriors battleship has appeared in realspace near the space station Endeavor of Will which is controlled by the Imperial Fists. The Fists strike cruiser is the first to try to intercept it. Velthinar Silverspine is a Nurgle demon that uses a tech virus to slave the ship to his will and he does the bidding of the Iron Warriors.*

*I love some good void warfare and this description of a Chaos ship is very unique.*

From the glare of the system's sun, the waning red star Kholestus, the *Ferrous Malice* dived through sensor-baffling bands of solar radiation. 


The *Siege of Malebruk* turned to face it, presenting a broadside which brought as many of its guns to bear as possible. In its tactical orrery, Chrystis and the ship's battle-cartographers used holographic void-maps, and rulers and compasses alike, to build up an arsenal of manouevers the *Siege* could execute depending on the actions of their enemy. On the *Ferrous Malice* far less natural things, crewmen possessed with daemons of cunning and corrupted machine-spirits, were doing the same. 


Naval battle proceeded at it’s own pace, as if time meant something different when it came to ship-to-ship murder in the void. Torpedoes and broadside shells proceeded not at the speed of gunfire, but lazily, spiraling through space to intersect with the likely locations of the enemy. It was war in which geometry and helmsmanship counted for more than aggression and fearlessness, cold-blooded and removed compared to the thunder of face-to-face battle.


That cool detachment broke as the first shells hit home. The barrage from the *Ferrous Malice’s* nose cannons speckled the hull of the *Siege* with silvery explosions, and inside, crewmen were shredded as metal deformed into bursts of jagged blades. Air shrieked out of hull breaches and damage control teams stationed beyond the inner hull died as the void boomed in to strangle and freeze them. Fires broke out, cutting off teams of crewmen with walls of flame.
 

The return fire from the *Siege* took its toll, hammering into the armoured prow of the enemy ship. Hull plates were torn free, and ribbons of frozen blood billowed out as the strange, half-living physiology of the ship was breached. The *Ferrous Malice* passed under the *Siege*, both ships battered by the first exchange of fire. 


The *Ferrous Malice* was the larger ship, a grand cruiser of a design long forgotten by the shipyards of the Imperial Navy, and it sported more firepower covering every angle of attack. But the *Siege of Malebruk* was a Space Marine strike cruiser, with far greater agility and a quick-witted machine-spirit that calculated thousands of attack solutions every moment at the same time as fending off the virus attacks from the mind of Velthinar Silverspine. The two spiralled around one another, the Chaos vessel in one moment seeming lumbering and slow, and in the next making the strike cruiser seem massively outgunned and outclassed.


But this was just the overture. In a plume of purple black flame, alchemical rockets flared along the spine of the *Ferrous Malice* and slowed it down suddenly, twisting it into a reverse manoeuver 
far beyond any Imperial-built ships of its size. At the same time its prow split open, revealing folds and tendons of vulnerable muscle, already torn and bleeding from the opening fire. From this biochemical mass emerged the snout of a nova cannon. Few Imperial shipyards could forge such a weapon now, and none knew the secrets of creating the nuclear flame that now flared around the barrel as the weapon charged. 


The crew of the *Siege of Malebruk* responded to this unexpected change in the battlefield by turning every effort towards evasion. The machine-spirit charted a crazed, jinking path that wrapped itself around the *Ferrous Malice*, too far for defensive turrets to open up against the strike cruiser but too close for the nova cannon to be brought to bear.


The nova cannon stayed silent. The *Siege of Malebruk* moved out of its arc of fire, even as the Chaos ship’s alchemical rockets fired again to turn it back on itself again.


The *Ferrous Malice* had no machine-spirit. In place of an artificial intelligence roosted a host of data-daemons, insubstantial warp creatures that flocked to serve their master, Velthinar. They squab-
bled and fought faster than the speed of thought and, through the sheer bedlam that went through their inhuman minds, wove battle plans that no enemy could predict. Their pronouncements were passed on to the crew and the strange unwholesome creatures that writhed through the oil sumps of the engine decks. The insane command structure of the ship, with the Iron Warriors over-seeing multiple castes of mind-slaves, possessees, daemons and mutants, should never have permitted anything so complicated as warship to function but the *Ferrous Malice* was a construct
of Chaos, transformed into a voidbound asylum by millennia in the warp, and by some incomprehensible process all the madness produced a ship that could think and act faster than should have
been possible for its size.


And so the *Ferrous Malice* rolled on its side, presenting a scarred expanse of hull to the enemy. The broadside guns mounted there did not fire, and the crew of the *Siege of Malebruk* took advantage of this unusual good luck to hammer out a broadside of their own, stripping away hull plating and ripping charred craters the length of the enemy. Fires billowed out into the void as ammunition and fuel stores cooked off. The wounding was terrible, with laser turrets boring holes decks deep and vast areas of the *Ferrous Malice* depressurizing and throwing struggling handfuls of crew into space.


Then the hull peeled away of its own accord. Coils of muscle unraveled, whipping across the closing gap between the two ships and wrapping around the extremities of the *Siege of Malebruk*. The tentacles reeled in the strike cruiser, even as armoured beaks, like the mouthparts of some sea-dwelling kraken, emerged from the ruination of torn flesh and metal inside the *Ferrous Malice*.


'The machine-spirit of the *Siege of Malebruk* had not factored in this turn of events. The ship had nothing to fight off the grand cruiser's predations. Up close it had its defensive turret fire, which was designed to shoot down approaching torpedoes and bombers and would have scarcely any impact on the mass of the *Ferrous Malice*. It had the option to board, but aside from the few spare crewmen it could arm it had only the single command squad who had accompanied Captain Lysander to the star fort. The *Ferrous Malice*, meanwhile was guaranteed to be brimming with mutants, psychopaths, and worse.


The Imperial Fists on board, offensive as the presence of the *Ferrous Malice* was, would not throw their lives away boarding it and accepting certain death. They would do more good opposing the ship’s undoubted intention to take on the *Endeavor of Will*. The order was given for the *Siege of Malebruk’s* crew to abandon ship. 


The *Ferrous Malice* had no intention of letting all those fleshy morsels go. Tendrils snapped out from its ruptured hull, snaring saviour pods and shuttle craft as they fled the *Siege*. Dozens of men and women died as their escape craft were smashed open, or were forced alive down one of the gullets that opened up within the biological mass beneath the hull of the *Ferrous Malice.* The armoured shuttle carrying the Imperial Fists weaved between spinning wrecks and the biological growths trying to ensnare it, the survival of five of the Imperium's finest warriors now down to nothing more than the encoded skills of servitor-pilot and a hefty dose of fate.


The *Ferrous Malice* reeled the *Siege of Malebruk* into a close embrace. Beaks armoured with bone crunched into the strike cruiser's engine hull, ripping sections through decks and shearing off one of the ship’s engine sections. Plasma coolant billowed silver-black into the vacuum, and the reactors discharged their power load in a storm of blue lightning. The shockwaves tore apart more escape craft, or shredded their guidance systems to send them tumbling without power in all directions.


The Chaos ship dismembered the strike cruiser, forcing massive chunks of spaceship into its many jaws. The machine-spirit of the *Siege of Malebruk* survived until the last, moving from one stack of datamedium to the next as parts of the ship were crushed or torn away. The strike cruiser was a gutted shell by the time it ran out of places to hide, and its existence winked out in the closing maw of the Chaos ship.


The *Ferrous Malice* let the remains of the *Siege of Malebruk* drift away. One side of the strike cruiser was gone completely, the rest hollowed out like a carcass abandoned by scavengers. The
Chaos ship had a bloated appearance, an insect gorged on blood, squatting in a haze of debris. Only a few silvery specks remained of the Siege's crew. The *Ferrous Malice*, sated for now, ignored the
fleeing escape craft, and the escapees clung to life for a few hours more as their craft headed for the relative safety of the *Endeavour of Will.* Among them were the five members of the Imperial Fists
First Company, seething with eagerness to get to grips with the enemy who had just handed them such a total defeat.",1b0q9c4,74,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1b0q9c4/excerpt_endeavor_of_will_void_warfare_with_a_iron/,"['Iron without, OHGODWHAT within.', ""I think void warfare is hard to read and write about but when it shows up it's cool to read and try to visualize."", '… And then Velthinar Silverspine gets his ass handed to him by the vengeful machine spirit of an Imperial Fists star fort.', 'This is surprisingly organic for Iron Warriors. I like it!', 'Every time I think I get a handle on the craziness that is the 40k universe, I am always reminded it could be worse. *Much* worse.']"
"""Edge Deathknell"", The Neckbearded Ronin (High Intelligence/Science Melee Build)","[Here's a video where I put a more challenging version of this build to use.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kTpZAEEXz4)

&#x200B;

**NAME, APPEARANCE, AND ROLEPLAY**

* I went into this build with a specific character in mind, so I concocted the name ""*Edge Deathknell*"", which I thought encapsulated the ""*overly edgy oc*"" vibe I was going for. You can name him anything you want, however. Speaking of which, this build makes the most sense playing as a man, but if you want to play this build as a woman, that's fine too.
* For my appearance, I went with pale skin to simulate a lack of sunlight, long unkempt hair, stubble, and a weak chin/jaw. As long as your character looks like the opposite of a badass, you're good. Unfortunately, there are no weight options to get the authentic experience.
* In general, try to always take the lazy way out and perform actions that benefit you at the expense of others. Always hack into any terminals you can, and take every chance you can get to flaunt your intelligence. Make sure to fail all the speech checks you can. Side with the Legion for the main story, and do their sidequests, wiping out all the NCR locations you find (*eventually*). Vehemently reject anything religious, because in this moment, you are euphoric.
* This build isn't really made with companions in mind, but if you want to use them, ED-E, Rex, Lily, and Raul are all decent options.

&#x200B;

**S.P.E.C.I.A.L. STATS**

* **Strength** should be set to **4** and raised to **6** using Intense Training and the Hypertrophy Accelerator. Not only will this meet the Strength requirement of the Katana right away, but it also gives extra carry weight (*to go with Hoarder*), melee damage, and Melee Weapons skill. It allows you to get Burden To Bear, Stonewall, Strong Back, and Super Slam.
* **Perception** should be set to **6**. This gives you some extra points in Lockpick and makes your compass more reliable. It allows you to get Better Criticals.
* **Endurance** should be set to **8** and raised to **10** using Intense Training and the Nocioception Regulator. This adds points to Unarmed (*for Piercing Strike and Slayer*) and Survival, as well as increasing your health, which is important for a melee build. With 10 Endurance, you can get implants to your heart's content. It allows you to get Toughness, Stonewall, Strong Back, Life Giver, Solar Powered, Old World Gourmet, Atomic, Implant GRX, and Burden To Bear.
* **Charisma** should be set to **1**. Charisma is a dump stat 90% of the time, more so since this build doesn't rely on companions, speech, or bartering, so the points are better spent elsewhere. It also makes sense for roleplay, as neckbeards aren't known for their charm.
* **Intelligence** should be set to **6**. Useful for the bonus to Science and Repair, as well as the extra skill points per level. It allows you to get Retention, Swift Learner, Comprehension, Educated, Entomologist, Nerd Rage, Voracious Reader, and Lessons Learned.
* **Agility** should be set to **7**. The AP bonus lets you use four regular attacks in V.A.T.S. It allows you to get Quick Draw, Action Boy, Slayer, and Nerves Of Steel.
* **Luck** should be set to **8** and raised to **10** using Intense Training and the Probability Calculator. Important due to the Katana's high crit multiplier, also makes gambling profitable. It allows you to get Miss Fortune, Mysterious Stranger, and Better Criticals.

&#x200B;

**SKILLS**

* I recommend tagging **Melee Weapons**, **Science**, and **Survival**. Lockpick and Repair are also acceptable tag skills. Unarmed should not be tagged because it is only useful for two perks down the road, and Sneak should only be tagged if that's your playstyle.
* **Lockpick** is a pretty standard skill for any playstyle, and it's a good compliment to Science. I wouldn't spend too many points on it, though.
* **Melee Weapons** is obviously an important skill for increasing your damage. At 50, you unlock the special attack ""*Unlabored Flawlessness*"", which does 250% more damage at the cost of 19 extra AP. You can also perform it by power attacking while moving forward.
* While this build doesn't rely on **Sneak**, it's possible to add it to your playstyle. Your armor will be light enough to make sneaking viable, and your weapon will swing fast enough that you can follow up with a series of blows after the initial sneak critical.
* Since the Katana is a unique weapon, **Repair** is a necessary investment. You can either keep it low and rely on vendors, or raise it and use the Jury Rigging perk.
* **Science** is more of a roleplay skill, as neckbeards spend most of their time on the computer. Still, it has a lot of uses in quests, as well as for gaining extra resources.
* Since this build can only consume junk food, **Survival** is going to be crucial, especially in Hardcore mode. It's also good for making poisons to give you an edge in combat.
* **Unarmed** is only useful for Piercing Strike and Slayer, so don't raise it past 90. If there's something more important to increase, increase it before Unarmed.

&#x200B;

**TRAITS**

* To fit with the overall nerdy theme of the build, choose **Four Eyes**. It reduces Perception by 1 but increases it by 2 while wearing any kind of glasses. Decent for seeing enemies from farther away and gaining some extra Lockpicking points, but mostly for roleplay.
* Another trait that works well for roleplay is **Hoarder** since neckbeards are known to collect and hoard junk. It increases your carry weight by 25 but reduces all your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats by 1 when you are carrying less than 160 pounds. Useful for carrying extra food and drink.
* Other useful traits are **Hot Blooded** (*meshes with Nerd Rage*), **Skilled**, **Built To Destroy** (*works with the katana's already high crit chance*), **Kamikaze**, and **Wild Wasteland**.

&#x200B;

**PERKS**

* Regular perks to consider are Hunter, Retention, Comprehension, Educated, Entomologist, Rad Child, Travel Light, Bloody Mess, Toughness, Stonewall, Strong Back, Super Slam, Finesse, Math Wrath, Miss Fortune, Mysterious Stranger, Nerd Rage, Life Giver, Piercing Strike, Adamantium Skeleton, Purifier, Action Boy, Better Criticals, Computer Whiz, Grim Reaper's Sprint, Slayer, and Nerves Of Steel. **Nerd Rage**, **Math Wrath**, and **Computer Whiz** are mostly for roleplaying, although the +15 DT while at low health can get you out of a tough situation. **Toughness**, **Stonewall**, **Life Giver**, and **Adamantium Skeleton** make up for your relatively low armor early game while ensuring you're a complete tank late game. **Bloody Mess**, **Hunter**, **Entomologist**, and **Purifier** ensure you deal a respectable amount of damage to all types of enemies, while also making people explode into gore like a true edgelord. **Retention** and **Comprehension** allow you to embrace your inner comic-book nerd. **Action Boy**, **Grim Reaper's Sprint**, **Mysterious Stranger**, **Miss Fortune**, and **Nerves Of Steel** are there if you want to focus more on V.A.T.S. **Rad Child** makes up for your limited healing options at the cost of a few S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points, which I think is well worth it. **Travel Light** is important for a melee build and makes exploration less of a pain. **Stong Back** works well with the Hoarder perk. **Super Slam** is a must-have for any melee build, especially when the Katana's attack speed is so high when combined with **Slayer**. The same can be said for **Piercing Strike**. Finally, **Finesse** and **Better Criticals** complement the high crit chance of the Katana, and with 10 Luck, critical hits become your bread and butter.
* DLC perks to consider are Light Touch, Old World Gourmet, Sneering Imperialist, Atomic, Implant GRX, Burden To Bear, and Ain't Like That Now. Since this build uses light armor, **Light Touch** increases the Katana's already high crit chance and your survivability against tougher enemies. **Old World Gourmet** is vital as it increases the effectiveness of junk food by 50%. **Sneering Imperalist** is a good roleplay perk considering this is a Legion build and that some neckbeards have... interesting opinions. **Atomic** meshes well with Rad Child and makes V.A.T.S. more reliable. **Implant GRX** allows you to go ultra instinct and slash up your foes in slowed time like a true anime protagonist. **Burden To Bear** meshes well with Hoarder. Finally, **Ain't Like That Now** increases the Katana's already high attack speed and your AP regeneration.
* Special perks to consider are **Abominable**, **Animal Control**, **Bug Stomper**, **Friendly Help**, **Machine Head**, **Melee Hacker**, **Tough Guy**, **Implant C-13**, **Implant Y-7**, **Sub-Dermal Armor**, **Monocyte Breeder**, **Sierra Madre Martini**, **Elijah's Ramblings**, **Reinforced Spine**, **DNAgent**, **DNavenger**, **The Bear-Slayer,** and **Lonesome Road**.

&#x200B;

**WEAPON**

* The only weapon this build uses is a **Katana**. It IS the pinnacle of Japanese craftsmanship after all. While it only does 22 damage, it makes up for it with its high crit chance of x2, high attack speed of 3.2 attacks per second, and double damage to limbs. It only weighs 3 pounds and uses 21 AP, and it has a special attack in V.A.T.S. that does 250% more damage at the cost of 19 extra Action Points, requiring a Melee Skill of 50 to perform. It has a low Strength requirement of 4, but a high Melee skill requirement of 75. It can be bought from Mick, Gloria Van Graff, or Cliff Briscoe. If all three of them are dead, it can bought from Vendortron.
* The **Balanced Grip** modification increases the attack speed of the Katana by 20%. Combine this with Rushing Water, Slayer, Ain't Like That Now, and Melee Hacker, and it can attack up to 6 times per second. It can be bought from Vendortron, Gloria, Chet, or Cliff.
* The **Authentic Blade** modification increases the damage of the Katana by 5, going from 22 to 27. It can be bought from Vendortron, Alexander, Mick, Cliff, or Gloria.
* The **Protective Sheath** modification increases the durability of the Katana from 995 to 1495 attacks before it breaks. It can be bought from Cliff, Vendortron, Mick, Gloria, or Chet.

&#x200B;

**APPAREL**

* For body armor, go with the **Bounty Hunter's Duster**. It provides 6 Damage Threshold, which is the highest for clothing besides Dr. Mobius' Scrubs. It only weighs 3 pounds, meaning it won't slow you down, and works with the Travel Light and Light Touch perks. It gives a bonus of +5 Guns (*which is worthless on a melee build*) and +1 Charisma (*which is less worthless since it lets you barter a bit easier*). It also fits the theme of the build, since neckbeards are frequently seen with trenchcoats. It can be found on Caleb McCaffery, Red Lucy, and Beatrix Russell.
* If that doesn't strike your fancy, there's always the generic **Trenchcoat**. It cannot be legitimately equipped in the base game, meaning you'll have to use mods. It provides a Damage Resistance of 5, which is separate from Damage Threshold. It weighs the same as the Bounty Hunter's Duster at 3 pounds. It can be found on Jay Barnes at the Ultra-Luxe. The **Sherrif's Duster** and **Regulator's Duster** are also options, although they provide no Damage Threshold.
* For your late-game body armor, go with either **Ulysses' Duster** or the **Courier Duster**. Uylsses' Duster also weighs 3 pounds but has a much better Damage Threshold of 13. It still provides +1 Charisma, but also increases your critical chance by 5%, which works well with the Katana's already high crit chance. The Courier Duster will always be the ""*Fighting Chance*"" variant since this is a Legion-aligned character. It has the same 13 Damage Threshold and 3 weight as Uylsses' Duster, but also increases your Strength by 1 (*useful for a melee build, and meshes with Hoarder*) and gives +15 Action Points (*effectively reduces the AP cost of Unlabored Flawlessness to 4*).
* As for your trusty (*and totally awesome*) fedora, there are several options, although they all have the same durability, weight, and +1 Perception Boost. There's the **Pre-War Hat**, **Vance's Lucky Hat**, the **Stylish Gambler Hat**, the **Fancy Gambler Hat**, and the **Dapper Gambler Hat**. There's also the **Suave Gambler Hat** and the generic **Fedora**, although the former is only obtainable with Wild Wasteland and the latter cannot be equipped similarly to the generic Trenchcoat. The generic Fedora also has no stat bonus. Any of the gambler hats can be found in the casinos, either worn by others or offered as a prize for winning big. The Pre-War Hat can be found in the El Rey Motel, while Vance's Lucky Hat can be found on Sammy Wins in the Wins Hideout.
* For your eyewear, go with **Dr. Klein's Glasses**. They provide a Damage Threshold of 1, increase your Intelligence by 1 (*useful if it gets decreased*), and give +5 Repair (*useful since repair is more of a secondary skill for this build*). With the Four Eyes perk, they also provide +2 Perception. Before you get them, wear **Eyeglasses**, which can be found in the El Rey Motel.

&#x200B;

**CONSUMABLES**

* Food you can consume is BlamCo Mac & Cheese, Bubblegum, Caravan Lunches, Cram, Dandy Boy Apples, Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, Gum Drops, InstaMash, Irradiated Mac & Cheese, Irradiated Cram, Irradiated Dandy Boy Apples, Irradiated Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, Irradiated InstaMash, Irradiated Pork N' Beans, Irradiated Potato Crisps, Irradiated Salisbury Steak, Irradiated Sugar Bombs, Irradiated YumYum Deviled Eggs, Junk Food, MRE, Mushroom Cloud, Noodles (*because ramen is from Japan, so it's awesome*), Pork N' Beans, Potato Crisps, Salisbury Steak, Sugar Bombs, Trail Mix, Wasteland Omelets, and YumYum Deviled Eggs.
* Drinks you can consume are Atomic Cocktails, Ice-Cold Nuka Cola, Irradiated Sunset Sarsaparilla, Nuka-Cola, Nuka-Cola Quantum, Nuka-Cola Quartz, Nuka-Cola Victory, Rum & Nuka, Sierra Madre Martinis, and Sunset Sarsparilla. If you're playing on Hardcore Mode, you'll have to drink from sources of water in the world, such as lakes, water fountains, and toilets.
* All aid items that don't require you to ingest them are fair game. These include **skill books**, **skill magazines**, **Stealth Boys**, **Weapon Repair Kits**, and **Snakebite Tourniquites**. **Poisons** can also be applied to your katana to boost your DPS massively.

* **Intelligence** should be set to **6**. Useful for the bonus to Science and Repair, as well as the extra skill points per level. It allows you to get Retention, Swift Learner, Comprehension, Educated, Entomologist, Nerd Rage, Voracious Reader, and Lessons Learned.
* **Agility** should be set to **7**. The AP bonus lets you use four regular attacks in V.A.T.S. It allows you to get Quick Draw, Action Boy, Slayer, and Nerves Of Steel.
* **Luck** should be set to **8** and raised to **10** using Intense Training and the Probability Calculator. Important due to the Katana's high crit multiplier, also makes gambling profitable. It allows you to get Miss Fortune, Mysterious Stranger, and Better Criticals.

&#x200B;

**SKILLS**

* I recommend tagging **Melee Weapons**, **Science**, and **Survival**. Lockpick and Repair are also acceptable tag skills. Unarmed should not be tagged because it is only useful for two perks down the road, and Sneak should only be tagged if that's your playstyle.
* **Lockpick** is a pretty standard skill for any playstyle, and it's a good compliment to Science. I wouldn't spend too many points on it, though.
* **Melee Weapons** is obviously an important skill for increasing your damage. At 50, you unlock the special attack ""*Unlabored Flawlessness*"", which does 250% more damage at the cost of 19 extra AP. You can also perform it by power attacking while moving forward.
* While this build doesn't rely on **Sneak**, it's possible to add it to your playstyle. Your armor will be light enough to make sneaking viable, and your weapon will swing fast enough that you can follow up with a series of blows after the initial sneak critical.
* Since the Katana is a unique weapon, **Repair** is a necessary investment. You can either keep it low and rely on vendors, or raise it and use the Jury Rigging perk.
* **Science** is more of a roleplay skill, as neckbeards spend most of their time on the computer. Still, it has a lot of uses in quests, as well as for gaining extra resources.
* Since this build can only consume junk food, **Survival** is going to be crucial, especially in Hardcore mode. It's also good for making poisons to give you an edge in combat.
* **Unarmed** is only useful for Piercing Strike and Slayer, so don't raise it past 90. If there's something more important to increase, increase it before Unarmed.

&#x200B;

**TRAITS**

* To fit with the overall nerdy theme of the build, choose **Four Eyes**. It reduces Perception by 1 but increases it by 2 while wearing any kind of glasses. Decent for seeing enemies from farther away and gaining some extra Lockpicking points, but mostly for roleplay.
* Another trait that works well for roleplay is **Hoarder** since neckbeards are known to collect and hoard junk. It increases your carry weight by 25 but reduces all your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats by 1 when you are carrying less than 160 pounds. Useful for carrying extra food and drink.
* Other useful traits are **Hot Blooded** (*meshes with Nerd Rage*), **Skilled**, **Built To Destroy** (*works with the katana's already high crit chance*), **Kamikaze**, and **Wild Wasteland**.

&#x200B;

**PERKS**

* Regular perks to consider are Hunter, Retention, Comprehension, Educated, Entomologist, Rad Child, Travel Light, Bloody Mess, Toughness, Stonewall, Strong Back, Super Slam, Finesse, Math Wrath, Miss Fortune, Mysterious Stranger, Nerd Rage, Life Giver, Piercing Strike, Adamantium Skeleton, Purifier, Action Boy, Better Criticals, Computer Whiz, Grim Reaper's Sprint, Slayer, and Nerves Of Steel. **Nerd Rage**, **Math Wrath**, and **Computer Whiz** are mostly for roleplaying, although the +15 DT while at low health can get you out of a tough situation. **Toughness**, **Stonewall**, **Life Giver**, and **Adamantium Skeleton** make up for your relatively low armor early game while ensuring you're a complete tank late game. **Bloody Mess**, **Hunter**, **Entomologist**, and **Purifier** ensure you deal a respectable amount of damage to all types of enemies, while also making people explode into gore like a true edgelord. **Retention** and **Comprehension** allow you to embrace your inner comic-book nerd. **Action Boy**, **Grim Reaper's Sprint**, **Mysterious Stranger**, **Miss Fortune**, and **Nerves Of Steel** are there if you want to focus more on V.A.T.S. **Rad Child** makes up for your limited healing options at the cost of a few S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points, which I think is well worth it. **Travel Light** is important for a melee build and makes exploration less of a pain. **Stong Back** works well with the Hoarder perk. **Super Slam** is a must-have for any melee build, especially when the Katana's attack speed is so high when combined with **Slayer**. The same can be said for **Piercing Strike**. Finally, **Finesse** and **Better Criticals** complement the high crit chance of the Katana, and with 10 Luck, critical hits become your bread and butter.
* DLC perks to consider are Light Touch, Old World Gourmet, Sneering Imperialist, Atomic, Implant GRX, Burden To Bear, and Ain't Like That Now. Since this build uses light armor, **Light Touch** increases the Katana's already high crit chance and your survivability against tougher enemies. **Old World Gourmet** is vital as it increases the effectiveness of junk food by 50%. **Sneering Imperalist** is a good roleplay perk considering this is a Legion build and that some neckbeards have... interesting opinions. **Atomic** meshes well with Rad Child and makes V.A.T.S. more reliable. **Implant GRX** allows you to go ultra instinct and slash up your foes in slowed time like a true anime protagonist. **Burden To Bear** meshes well with Hoarder. Finally, **Ain't Like That Now** increases the Katana's already high attack speed and your AP regeneration.
* Special perks to consider are **Abominable**, **Animal Control**, **Bug Stomper**, **Friendly Help**, **Machine Head**, **Melee Hacker**, **Tough Guy**, **Implant C-13**, **Implant Y-7**, **Sub-Dermal Armor**, **Monocyte Breeder**, **Sierra Madre Martini**, **Elijah's Ramblings**, **Reinforced Spine**, **DNAgent**, **DNavenger**, **The Bear-Slayer,** and **Lonesome Road**.

&#x200B;

**WEAPON**

* The only weapon this build uses is a **Katana**. It IS the pinnacle of Japanese craftsmanship after all. While it only does 22 damage, it makes up for it with its high crit chance of x2, high attack speed of 3.2 attacks per second, and double damage to limbs. It only weighs 3 pounds and uses 21 AP, and it has a special attack in V.A.T.S. that does 250% more damage at the cost of 19 extra Action Points, requiring a Melee Skill of 50 to perform. It has a low Strength requirement of 4, but a high Melee skill requirement of 75. It can be bought from Mick, Gloria Van Graff, or Cliff Briscoe. If all three of them are dead, it can bought from Vendortron.
* The **Balanced Grip** modification increases the attack speed of the Katana by 20%. Combine this with Rushing Water, Slayer, Ain't Like That Now, and Melee Hacker, and it can attack up to 6 times per second. It can be bought from Vendortron, Gloria, Chet, or Cliff.
* The **Authentic Blade** modification increases the damage of the Katana by 5, going from 22 to 27. It can be bought from Vendortron, Alexander, Mick, Cliff, or Gloria.
* The **Protective Sheath** modification increases the durability of the Katana from 995 to 1495 attacks before it breaks. It can be bought from Cliff, Vendortron, Mick, Gloria, or Chet.

&#x200B;

**APPAREL**

* For body armor, go with the **Bounty Hunter's Duster**. It provides 6 Damage Threshold, which is the highest for clothing besides Dr. Mobius' Scrubs. It only weighs 3 pounds, meaning it won't slow you down, and works with the Travel Light and Light Touch perks. It gives a bonus of +5 Guns (*which is worthless on a melee build*) and +1 Charisma (*which is less worthless since it lets you barter a bit easier*). It also fits the theme of the build, since neckbeards are frequently seen with trenchcoats. It can be found on Caleb McCaffery, Red Lucy, and Beatrix Russell.
* If that doesn't strike your fancy, there's always the generic **Trenchcoat**. It cannot be legitimately equipped in the base game, meaning you'll have to use mods. It provides a Damage Resistance of 5, which is separate from Damage Threshold. It weighs the same as the Bounty Hunter's Duster at 3 pounds. It can be found on Jay Barnes at the Ultra-Luxe. The **Sherrif's Duster** and **Regulator's Duster** are also options, although they provide no Damage Threshold.
* For your late-game body armor, go with either **Ulysses' Duster** or the **Courier Duster**. Uylsses' Duster also weighs 3 pounds but has a much better Damage Threshold of 13. It still provides +1 Charisma, but also increases your critical chance by 5%, which works well with the Katana's already high crit chance. The Courier Duster will always be the ""*Fighting Chance*"" variant since this is a Legion-aligned character. It has the same 13 Damage Threshold and 3 weight as Uylsses' Duster, but also increases your Strength by 1 (*useful for a melee build, and meshes with Hoarder*) and gives +15 Action Points (*effectively reduces the AP cost of Unlabored Flawlessness to 4*).
* As for your trusty (*and totally awesome*) fedora, there are several options, although they all have the same durability, weight, and +1 Perception Boost. There's the **Pre-War Hat**, **Vance's Lucky Hat**, the **Stylish Gambler Hat**, the **Fancy Gambler Hat**, and the **Dapper Gambler Hat**. There's also the **Suave Gambler Hat** and the generic **Fedora**, although the former is only obtainable with Wild Wasteland and the latter cannot be equipped similarly to the generic Trenchcoat. The generic Fedora also has no stat bonus. Any of the gambler hats can be found in the casinos, either worn by others or offered as a prize for winning big. The Pre-War Hat can be found in the El Rey Motel, while Vance's Lucky Hat can be found on Sammy Wins in the Wins Hideout.
* For your eyewear, go with **Dr. Klein's Glasses**. They provide a Damage Threshold of 1, increase your Intelligence by 1 (*useful if it gets decreased*), and give +5 Repair (*useful since repair is more of a secondary skill for this build*). With the Four Eyes perk, they also provide +2 Perception. Before you get them, wear **Eyeglasses**, which can be found in the El Rey Motel.

&#x200B;

**CONSUMABLES**

* Food you can consume is BlamCo Mac & Cheese, Bubblegum, Caravan Lunches, Cram, Dandy Boy Apples, Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, Gum Drops, InstaMash, Irradiated Mac & Cheese, Irradiated Cram, Irradiated Dandy Boy Apples, Irradiated Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, Irradiated InstaMash, Irradiated Pork N' Beans, Irradiated Potato Crisps, Irradiated Salisbury Steak, Irradiated Sugar Bombs, Irradiated YumYum Deviled Eggs, Junk Food, MRE, Mushroom Cloud, Noodles (*because ramen is from Japan, so it's awesome*), Pork N' Beans, Potato Crisps, Salisbury Steak, Sugar Bombs, Trail Mix, Wasteland Omelets, and YumYum Deviled Eggs.
* Drinks you can consume are Atomic Cocktails, Ice-Cold Nuka Cola, Irradiated Sunset Sarsaparilla, Nuka-Cola, Nuka-Cola Quantum, Nuka-Cola Quartz, Nuka-Cola Victory, Rum & Nuka, Sierra Madre Martinis, and Sunset Sarsparilla. If you're playing on Hardcore Mode, you'll have to drink from sources of water in the world, such as lakes, water fountains, and toilets.
* All aid items that don't require you to ingest them are fair game. These include **skill books**, **skill magazines**, **Stealth Boys**, **Weapon Repair Kits**, and **Snakebite Tourniquites**. **Poisons** can also be applied to your katana to boost your DPS massively.

Detailed and takes everything into consideration memes or not. Might have to give this a try lmaoo', 'If it’s a neckbeard wouldn’t it be super unfit and one minded']"
"""Edge Deathknell"", The Neckbearded Ronin (PER, END, INT, LCK, MELEE, SCIENCE, SURVIVAL)","[Here's a video where I put a more challenging version of this build to use.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kTpZAEEXz4)

&#x200B;

**NAME, APPEARANCE, AND ROLEPLAY**

* I went into this build with a specific character in mind, so I concocted the name ""*Edge Deathknell*"", which I thought encapsulated the ""*overly edgy oc*"" vibe I was going for. You can name him anything you want, however. Speaking of which, this build makes the most sense playing as a man, but if you want to play this build as a woman, that's fine too.
* For my appearance, I went with pale skin to simulate a lack of sunlight, long unkempt hair, stubble, and a weak chin/jaw. As long as your character looks like the opposite of a badass, you're good. Unfortunately, there are no weight options to get the authentic experience.
* In general, try to always take the lazy way out and perform actions that benefit you at the expense of others. Always hack into any terminals you can, and take every chance you can get to flaunt your intelligence. Make sure to fail all the speech checks you can. Side with the Legion for the main story, and do their sidequests, wiping out all the NCR locations you find (*eventually*). Vehemently reject anything religious, because in this moment, you are euphoric.
* This build isn't really made with companions in mind, but if you want to use them, ED-E, Rex, Lily, and Raul are all decent options.

&#x200B;

**S.P.E.C.I.A.L. STATS**

* **Strength** should be set to **4** and raised to **6** using Intense Training and the Hypertrophy Accelerator. Not only will this meet the Strength requirement of the Katana right away, but it also gives extra carry weight (*to go with Hoarder*), melee damage, and Melee Weapons skill. It allows you to get Burden To Bear, Stonewall, Strong Back, and Super Slam.
* **Perception** should be set to **6**. This gives you some extra points in Lockpick and makes your compass more reliable. It allows you to get Better Criticals.
* **Endurance** should be set to **8** and raised to **10** using Intense Training and the Nocioception Regulator. This adds points to Unarmed (*for Piercing Strike and Slayer*) and Survival, as well as increasing your health, which is important for a melee build. With 10 Endurance, you can get implants to your heart's content. It allows you to get Toughness, Stonewall, Strong Back, Life Giver, Solar Powered, Old World Gourmet, Atomic, Implant GRX, and Burden To Bear.
* **Charisma** should be set to **1**. Charisma is a dump stat 90% of the time, more so since this build doesn't rely on companions, speech, or bartering, so the points are better spent elsewhere. It also makes sense for roleplay, as neckbeards aren't known for their charm.
* **Intelligence** should be set to **6**. Useful for the bonus to Science and Repair, as well as the extra skill points per level. It allows you to get Retention, Swift Learner, Comprehension, Educated, Entomologist, Nerd Rage, Voracious Reader, and Lessons Learned.
* **Agility** should be set to **7**. The AP bonus lets you use four regular attacks in V.A.T.S. It allows you to get Quick Draw, Action Boy, Slayer, and Nerves Of Steel.
* **Luck** should be set to **8** and raised to **10** using Intense Training and the Probability Calculator. Important due to the Katana's high crit multiplier, also makes gambling profitable. It allows you to get Miss Fortune, Mysterious Stranger, and Better Criticals.

From KAC website :

5.56mm M4QD NT-4 MAMS Muzzle Brake  
PN:32316  
The KAC 5.56 MAMS (Multi-Axis Muzzle Stability) Brake has been engineered to increase controllability, to significantly reduce felt recoil, and to help mitigate a rifle’s flash signature as compared to traditional muzzle brake designs. The MAMS is a neutral bias brake that combats both muzzle rise and drift upon firing. Depending on the gun’s barrel length, it can reduce felt recoil in a 5.56 x 45mm gun by as much as 67 percent. The 5.56 M4QD NT-4 MAMS is compatible with KAC’s QDSS-NT4 5.56mm sound suppressor, and comes complete with a 7-piece shim kit and installation instructions.

Need your help guys,"Long time lurker who loves reading this sun. We have a 4 year old who, while thriving in many ways, also has very little impulse control, much like many other boys his age. While he’s challenging, I’m up for the challenge and to help to guide him on becoming a young man. But I must admit, since he’s turned 4, he’s hit another level of frustration as he’s clearly looking for the boundaries. This morning, his daycare teacher approached me and said that he had made some troubling remarks to other children in class which mostly involve finding a toy and pretending it’s a gun and/or weapon and making threatening remarks including “I’m gonna hit you” or “I’m gonna kill you”. I don’t believe he means the latter nor do I believe he even understands the magnitude of what he’s said. I’ve never heard him say this at home and we don’t watch violent tv with the kids present.  We even recently stopped with Ninja turtles because he just kept harassing his little brother.  I am not sure where he picked this one up, but alas, here we are. 

So, dads, how do I appropriately explain to him that this is inappropriate language and how should I begin to have the discussion as to the magnitude of the situation?  For others that may have been thru something similar, including frustrating toddler outbursts, I’m all ears. Thank you. ",1b0okwx,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1b0okwx/need_your_help_guys/,"['I agree that it\'s inappropriate language but at this age I don\'t think it needs to be made into a huge deal.\xa0\n\n\n""Those words are not kind, we don\'t say that to people"". And just repeat it constantly.\xa0', 'I would use the methods in the free online Yale ABCs of Child Rearing course at Coursera. These are the most effective methods according to numerous randomized controlled trials.\n\nIs he physically or verbally harassing his brother?\n\nNot all behaviors are picked up somewhere. Sometimes it just something random that is inadvertently reinforced and often the reinforcement is adult attention.']"
Stats of all order members: All members,"Ordered from who has the most Stat total not weakest to strongest.

**Kanaguri 7.16**: Kanaguri The Filmmaker, he’s a capable fighters able to Fight with a a more serious Sakamoto and managed to kill Satoda an order candidate (Although she was in her old age and has not fought seriously in years.) He has a very high battle IQ, being able to fight in room full of lasers and being able to trick Sakamoto using his make up (although he didn’t work for long it got him a clean hit.) 

His main weakness being his strength he never managed over power current Sakamoto who is weaker than current Nagumo.

**X Facters**

**Unshaken camera:** When he holds his camera, he will not moved or taken off the shot.

**Stage light:** A stage light that works as a laser.



**Osaragi 7.26**: Osaragi The trainee of the order. she isn’t as strong as Gaku, even though they have the same number. She is in the same tier because she’s closer to eight 8 then she is 7 she is a 7.8-7.7

The rest of her stats is just 7 other than speed is which is 8 she is a bit standard compared to the other order members (well she is a trainee), Yorsamura didn’t see her as anything but a little girl when she slammed him through multiple walls (she tried to kill him with her first attack.) so he can react to her off guard and she wasn’t skilled enough to take advantage of her element of surprise, which she has X Factor specializing in,

**X Factors**

**Spinning death** Her weapon has the largest range out of any hand held weapon in the series.

**Cleaning Out Bugs** No killing intent most characters use killing intent as a way to sense a targets Movements she has none so much so even though a mind reader has trouble understanding her thoughts not because she’s hiding them because they don’t match how she’s feeling.

**Wild beast** The way she fights breaks the rules of killing, as her choices don’t make sense to practiced fighters. The same geisha that managed to predict and dodge Yotsomura finds her difficult to understand.



**Kamihate 7.33**: (**I made a couple mistakes with a stat block but I don’t want to have to redo the post to fix it, both his defense and durability is at 5, combat skill should only be at a 10, funny enough the total doesn’t change**)

Kamihate the greatest sniper in the JAA and the God of the environment. He has the ability to make use of the environment effortlessly with just a single bullet shooting pass any obstacle whether you’re in a building in a crowd or a moving car with civilians there is nowhere where he can’t get a headshot. He’s very quick on his feet able to change positions after each shot, leaping from building to building.

Though he is probably the weakest in close quarters combat as he only focuses on sniping and nothing more.

X Factor

**Immense range** he can land a shot up to 8 km away

**Godly eyesight** he can see and understand things from very far away and hard to see places.

**The so-called God of the environment** able to manipulate the environment to kill a target.

 (Though his environmental manipulation is impressive he can’t do it as well as Sakamoto because:  It’s way easier to manipulate the environment with your hands then a bullet as he can’t grab or hold anything, he doesn’t use any other weapons, he doesn’t have the stats to make use of it and he’s plainly isn’t as creative. Though he has one thing over him and that is his range he can control the environment over a larger range)



**Yotsumura 7.5**: The co-creator of the order and it’s former number two, he has excellent combat skill and Battle IQ, proven by the fight with Shishiba as he could fight in total darkness he also figured out how Shishiba countered his strategy. Additionally even in his old age, he was able to match Shishiba for the entire match, not losing any ground and not get hurt until the final moments of the fight. He has no X factors or specialties

His main weakness would be endurance as he was taken out in one hit, I am assuming it’s because of his old age.



**Kindaka 7.58 or 7.66**: Kindaka the creator of the order and it’s former number one, he’s the fastest in the order even out of his prime. Is the other main state his defense he tanked an off guard attack from both Sakamoto and Nagumo, plus he managed to take an off guard full power attack from Sakamoto without being able to defend himself at all and afterwords Sakamoto is wondering how he still alive.

His Battle IQ Against the squad was pretty good he feels experienced he sees through Nagumo’s lies immediately, instantly understands Yuto’s abilities and skills and told **SAKAMOTO** he’s not using the environment enough. But then he sits down and thinks too much I’m sure he’s doing this because he’s testing them and he doesn’t believe they can kill him. His strength and endurance are low, (endurance is mainly because of his age) he threw his back out and that stop him from fighting the rest of the ark, he didn’t do any real damage to Sakamoto’s group.

**X Factor**

**Godly reaction speed** he can’t control his body even while moving faster then most human beings can see, even stopping on a dime.



**Shishiba 7.8**: Shishiba The most simple member of the order. Just like his teacher he is more of a standard and simple fighter having no specialties or X factors, oddly enough because of that he doesn’t have any distinct weaknesses or holes in his game. He is skilled enough to run through a plethora of assassins and fighting in complete darkness. He’s also out smarted Yotsumura by using his hammers as a mirror.



**Nagumo 8**: Nagumo one of top two in the order, currently in the order he is the smartest and the most trickiest opponent you could possibly face. Although he doesn’t have the highest battle IQ, what he uses that IQ for is what makes him impressive, he focuses on stealth and surprise more than using the environment. He has no distinct weaknesses. Yes although he doest have the second highest stats in the order he makes up for it with his X Factors. (I’m assuming hill was considered in that statement)

**X Factors**

**Swiss army Blade:** He has constant changing weaponry that catches most enemies off guard. 

**Invisible Blade:** an invisible weapon that only works once per fight, once it’s used it’s most likely the end of the fight. (Honestly this thing is a Battle IQ check, if you get too focused on his plethora of weaponry OR you lose focus because you can’t keep track, you’re just gonna get killed)

**Perfect disguise:** he can transform himself or anyone else into a perfect replica of the person, using make up and making disguises on the spot.



**Hyo 8.16**: Hyo although he considered himself among the weakest in the order, he has one of the higher stats totals. He was previously the Physically strongest in the order (not including a certain someone), with his only weakness is being battle IQ.

The main reason it’s so low, is because he’s the only order member who has died due to assuming an opponent is dead. Additionally he could not protect people around him without getting killed himself. (honestly this is not a knock against him I think the only characters who could do this or the one with Battle IQ 8 and up) His speed stat could go on stage are higher if Kumanomi manages to keep up with Shishiba in her 1v1, but for now as It at a 7.

X Factors

**Lowtier regeneration:** he can recover from most damage, he is the only one stated to recover midfight from deadly wounds. Thou it takes time as it seems like he needs to stand still for a while, as each time he was a hit by the Rail gun he was taken out of the fight for a while.



**Takamura 9.5**: Takemura the bloody legend of the order and it’s current number one. He managed to out speed, out power and out skill Gaku, he managed to tank the explosion without needing any treatment. The only reason he’s not getting a nine is because, I don’t know if he was fully undamaged or could’ve properly fought afterwards, remember he was near the epicenter everyone else was a bit further away.

The only weakness he has is battle IQ he doesn’t use the environment, doesn’t trick the opponent, and even though he’s always blood lost it somehow Gaku got away where I am 90% confident Takamura should’ve take in his head instead of his arm, also fact that he did not confirm his kill leading him to get blown up and his targets to get away.

**X Factor**

**Site without site:** he has the ability to fight without using his eyes



**Sakamoto 9.5**: Sakamoto The loving father and husband, also he was the greatest assassin in the world. His main stats are his combat skill and battle IQ, he candy to block bullets, uses clothes as a parachute, can make an origami ninja star be lethal, use the environment as a weapon and much much more.

He also has great endurance, durability and strength. has had his stomach cut in a similar way to Gaku, and continued fighting without it seeming like a kill blow. A younger none prime Sakamoto got stabbed in the chest and stomach repeatedly, he showed no reaction and again it wasn’t treated as a leathal attack. Prime Sakamoto scales above both of these feats, so he gets a 9 or 10 for endurance. Fat Sakamoto not trying to kill was relative in speed to a Nerfed Gaku trying to kill, prime Sakamoto should be above gaku by the scaleing.

X Factor

**God of the battlefield:** he can use any and everything as a weapon, even the very battlefield he’s standing on is a weapon.

**Protector** When his friends or family are in danger he gets a grate strength and speed boost.",1b0o3nw,88,12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1b0o3nw,"['This is Pure art work\n\nKeep cooking.

30 [M4F] #Ohio/Online - Submissive Male Looking for Eventual FLR or Short Term,"Male sub here on the East side Of Cincinnati looking for dominant women or couples to submit to. I’m white 6’3 170lbs, long hair with a girthy cock :x Average build with other very little body hair 

I enjoy old horror movies and sci-fi. Currently have been binge watching the x-files. I like to get outside and hike, camp, fish when i have the time to. I’ve also been getting back into skateboarding. I play games on pc when there’s nothing else going on 

Favorite kinks are bondage, orgasm control/denial, and general power dynamics. Open to almost all kinks, we can chat about more. I’d love to give up all control and be used for your pleasure! I’ve always been a people pleaser in general and my last relationships. I love making my partners life easier however I can! I’m not the most experienced sexually, only had 2 partners that were both very vanilla.

My only real hard limits I’m aware of right now are illegal, permanent damage, knife/gun play, obvious public, and blackmail. Sounding is a soft limit, I’d like to try it though!

I would prefer to find something long term. Ideally a FLR TPE relationship but I’m open to something more casual too! Also looking for more friends into kink in general. I don’t have many others to discuss it with :x",1b0nw61,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1b0nw61/30_m4f_ohioonline_submissive_male_looking_for/,"[""Just a heads up: this post has been locked, as all posts on r/r4r are.

What we need out of the Next Ghost recon,"So im not gonna go into to much detail as most of my suggestions will come with explanations themselves so let's just get into it.

First is the setting, it's kinda key to some of my suggestions. I feel we need a return to combat in an active Warzone. Whether it is the ghost supporting a rebal group against a tyranical government, or deplying alongside Nato forces for a full scale conflict, the map should be a hotbed of conflict and dangers. With that type of setting, there should be some sort of territory mechanic where ghosts and thier allies can take bases and occupy/defend them against enemies attempting to retake them.

With the setting of an active warzone, there should be a combination of infantry, Aircraft, and ARMORED VEHICLES to fight against. And when I say armored vehicles I mean TANKS I wanna fight ACTUAL tanks again in a ghost recon game not fucking drones with mini guns. Along with that if I down an enemy jet with a stinger or disable a BTR with a AT rocket the crew should try to escape that vehicle if it's only disabled but not destroyed.

Bring back the focus on squad tactics and get rid of this stupid superhero skill trees we have had for the past couple games. There are still soldiers not Spartans in super armor. 

Let my choices have an effect on the damned game. Add factions that control territories, then let me CHOOSE who to ally with, then let me help them take territory/bases from the other factions and when I take a base let it have effects on the faction I took it from. Like taking a vehicle Depot should reduce that factions vehicle patrols in the area, or taking an ammo dump from the enemy should make the enemies not engage in full blown fire fights when engaged. My choices should effect the gsmeplay and how the world is around me.

I could list more but then this post would be gigantic so these are the top things I want in the next Ghost Recon. Along with the options for both First and Third person gameplay, with mechics specific for both, like leaning for first person and a cover to cover system for third person.",1b0neoc,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/1b0neoc/what_we_need_out_of_the_next_ghost_recon/,"['Agreed. Could also be used in conjunction with some kind of hearts and minds rating, ie if you are assisting a faction and liberate a village then people in that village could give you intel or join that faction making it harder for an enemy to retake the area. Also agree on the skill tree, instead maybe use it for the factions where you have to complete tasks for training them and make them more combat effective as opposed to buying something off the skill tree. Ghosts started as sf and sf do a lot of different tasks on deployment so variation like this would def add to immersion.', 'Pasting this for the 68349673463484628967396725th time, dont mind me\n\n\nThis is what I want in the next GR game on top of whatever world model Ubi decides to adopt (sandbox / open world whatever)\n* [Rescue OPS under highly volatile conditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k33udNwt4W8&t=1000s)\n* [Gunsmith with shooting range, bipods or the ability to test our modifications without starting a mission](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/14xq9ov/gunsmith_acr_comparison_grfs_v_grw_v_grb/)\n* [SWIFT cover mechanic or the ability to roll over obstacles or 2500 + smooth takedowns, intense firefight camera shaking animations](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/yqf1tm/game_mechanics_that_wildlands_and_breakpoint_are/)\n* [Cross Com Chatter](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/rr5vzw/when_me_and_my_bois_are_heavily_outnumbered_and/) Do you know what it feels like to have CROSS COM ON?\n* Any tactical game is incomplete without some breaching or action sequences.

Penguin Highway,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m1wa1f59sykc1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85c66e7cc59629699b4602bdbd23fc6629e726ed

A very peculiar anime that is not quite suitable for a mass audience. But those who will like it, like me, may well get such moral, intellectual and aesthetic pleasure from ""Penguin Highway"" which watching other animated movies will hardly bring. First of all, it should be noted that although this movie is about children, it is not at all for children and not even for most teenagers. Rather, it will resonate with young adults and mature people, especially with those who were or are fond of science fiction, and will immediately recognize the roots of “Penguin Highway” in Lem's “Solaris”, Lewis Carroll's “Alice in Wonderland” and Heinlein juveniles. Probably fans of Satoshi Kon's surrealistic narration will also like “Penguin Highway”, although the drawing and the general mood here are not close to him, but rather to the creations of Studio Ghibli. As if opening the “door into summer”, this anime, along the mysterious penguin highway, will take you to a childhood full of miracles and aspirations, plunge into the atmosphere of a summer adventure, a fairy tale and a warm ocean of sincere love, accompanying your journey with excellent symphonic music filled with allusions to Bach and Bizet.  


For all its magic, ""Penguin Highway"" is full of subtle psychological observations and sketches related to the everyday life: protagonist's (Aoyama) childish curiosity and openness of mind to the new, encouraged his father, Aoyama's little sister's awareness of mortality, his inescapable absorption by the vortex of love, when Aoyama sits enchanted by the face of the sleeping Lady, feeling joy and marveling every tiny detail which makes it perfect, his boyish interest in his beloved's breasts (which he even turned into a kind of ""psychological anchor"", as thinking about these Lady’s charms helps Aoyama cope with anger and irritation), Aoyama's stoicism and gradually acquired ability to understand others, immature manifestations of Hamamoto's jealousy and Suzuki's love. Such a combination of realism and psychologism with surrealism can lead to the false conclusion that the ""Penguin Highway"" is a representative of magical realism. But it is not so - this is hard science fiction, which, like Lem's ""Solaris"", raises the question of the limitations of rational knowledge and, like Tarkovsky's interpretation of ""Solaris"" and C.S. Lewis\` philosophical essay ""The Abolition of Man"", supplements it with the question of the ethical boundaries of scientific research and the significance of love and morality, their relations with rationality when confronted with the unknown.  


Perhaps the main asset of ""Penguin Highway"" is the wonderful characters, especially the couple of main characters. Aoyama, although a ten-year-old boy, is as far from your “ordinary schoolboy” or the stereotypical child in anime in general as possible. Our hero is a true follower of the philosophy of stoicism, like reincarnated Marcus Aurelius. He is confident, fearless, extremely intelligent, adamant and charismatic. His character is so vividly and boldly spelled out that the rest, even rather non-standard characters except maybe for his beloved Lady, noticeably fade against his background. Aoyama has strong logical mind, an irrepressible thirst for knowledge, a vivid imagination, a strong character and firm principles. He, as a real philosopher, is driven by love for truth and love for beauty, and also by love for the Other, which does not allow him to turn into a complete egoist. He is passionate about solving mysteries, although Aoyama's logical mind sometimes makes it difficult for him to understand the feelings of those around him. Thus he seems incomplete, lacking insight and empathy.  


On the example of the protagonist, the anime has a good moral message, including with regard to raising a boy who is not just a ""enthusiastic nerd"", like secondary character Uchida, but also quite a courageous, even fearless young man, who does not shy away from violence, if necessary, as well as a loyal friend and a principled person with an unshakable sense of dignity. He builds and orderly follows hierarchy of values, not wanting to compromise it in his pursuit for the ideal, putting all his love and reason into achieving it.  


To match Aoyama there is the aforementioned Lady (""onee-san"" in the original, which literally translates as ""older sister"" but in the context means Miss or Young Lady) - beautiful about 20-year-old girl with graceful hourglass figure, kind, cheerful and witty, who in her free from spending with Aoyama time, is engaged in fixing holes in teeth (she is dental assistant) and in the space-time continuum. Aoyama is utterly in love with her, deeply caring for the Lady, enjoying watching her face while also being passionate connoisseur of her magnificent bust. However, like Aoyama, she is also incomplete, being overly dreamy and carefree. The Lady often spends time with Aoyama, teasing him, chatting and training him to master the game of chess.  


There are also slightly more stereotypical secondary characters - Aoyama's friend, a timid nerd Uchida, the excellent student Hamamoto who is in love with Aoyama and jealous of the Lady, the hooligan Suzuki who is in love with Hamamoto and jealous of Aoyama, the wise father of Aoyama, Aoyama’s little sister - they all create beautiful backdrop, enriching and advancing the main narrative.  


The town in which Aoyama lives has already been studied by him, the surrounding world is logically ordered, and the plan for the future, in which Aoyama becomes a great man and marries the Lady, has been drawn up and is not subject to discussion. Interestingly, the beginning and end of the anime are accompanied by approximately the same, self-confident remarks by Aoyama which at first sound like empty boasting and yet perceived completely different afterwards.  


But then chaos bursts into the carefully built rational little world of Aoyama - in a town far from the ocean, Antarctic penguins appear from nowhere. Of course, this ridiculous event challenges the wunderkind's mind and worldview. He immediately rushed to hypothesize about the causes of the phenomenon - from lost pets or falling out of a zoo van, to mutated crows. However, events take on a completely irrational turn when it turns out that the penguins are created by the Aoyama's beloved Lady, and a giant sphere of oceanic water hanging in the air is found in a forest clearing outside the town. The Lady herself does not quite understand who she is, how she creates creatures and asks our little hero to solve this riddle. So Aoyama faces the real Mystery - at the same time his scientific and love interest, which can quench his thirst for knowledge and beauty.  


The novel (by Tomihiko Morimi) on which this anime is based as well as the anime itself have clear references to Stanislaw Lem's novel ""Solaris"" (Aoyama even mentions ""Stanislaw Syndrome"" at the dentist's) which has strict sci-fi narrative, questioning rational cognition. However the Penguin Highway novel was heavily inspired not only by the Lem's novel itself but by the Tarkovsky's interpretation of Solaris in his 1972 art film as well which is full of symbols and metaphors. “Penguin Highway” takes Tarkovsky's vision on the main problem (that the correct solution of the problem of relationship between the subject and the object of scientific research, the way to approach the Mystery, is to treat it not like a mere abstract object, but through empathy and love, applying high moral standards while doing so) and replaces Kris Kelvin (main character) who in the movie represents the right way to treat the Unknown but was tormented by guilt, with Aoyama - pure child with clear conscience. ""Penguin Highway"" basically deals with the same epistemological problem as ""Solaris"". This problem of limitation of rational cognition and ethical restrictions of dealing with the unknown is profoundly explained by Tarkovsky in his interview and by C.S. Lewis in ""The Abolition of Man"".  


Tarkovsky puts the main problem this way: ""The only thing that can be done is to try to take a critical look at the ways of our cognition: through the fight against stereotypes of thinking, with those blocks of logical stereotypes that often replace minutes of reflection for us. Facing something unknown will necessarily require strict moral discipline. That is why the father of our hero says that everything is very fragile there, meaning rather the inertia of human thinking, the way of human behavior in the face of this unknown: as yet unknown. And not for the purpose of preserving themselves, although this also matters, but for the sake of not injuring the unknown, which human thought touches for the first time"".  


C.S. Lewis deals with the same problem in the “The Abolition of Man”: “It is not the greatest of modern scientists who feel most sure that the object, stripped of its qualitative properties and reduced to mere quantity, is wholly real. Little scientists, and little unscientific followers of science, may think so. The great minds know very well that the object, so treated, is an artificial abstraction, that something of its reality has been lost… Many a mild-eyed scientist in pincenez, many a popular dramatist, many an amateur philosopher in our midst, means in the long run just the same as the Nazi rulers of Germany - Traditional values are to be ‘debunked’ and mankind to be cut out into some fresh shape at the will (which must, by hypothesis, be an arbitrary will) of some few lucky people in one lucky generation which has learned how to do it. The belief that we can invent ‘ideologies’ at pleasure, and the consequent treatment of mankind as mere υλη, specimens, preparations, begins to affect our very language… I suggest that from Science herself the cure might come… The regenerate science which I have in mind would not do even to minerals and vegetables what modern science threatens to do to man himself. When it explained it would not explain away. When it spoke of the parts it would remember the whole. While studying the “It” it would not lose what Martin Buber calls the “Thou”-situation”.  


One might think that a conflict cannot but arise when Aoyama falls in love with the Lady - the same phenomenon becomes both the subject of Aoyama's scientific interest and the subject of his love interest. Modern science had rejected many moral norms and is trying to remove the ""rigid fetters"" of any ethics, denying objective value and turning even man into ""nature"" - subject to dismemberment, study and modification. Sartorius in the “Solaris” argues that conducting experiments on “visitors”, including performing autopsy, is totally acceptable - he considers such behavior to be “humane” and in line with scientific approach he believes in. As Lewis describes this worldview: “we have been trying, like Lear, to have it both ways: to lay down our human prerogative and yet at the same time to retain it. It is impossible. either we are rational spirit obliged for ever to obey the absolute values, or else we are mere nature to be kneaded and cut into new shapes for the pleasures of masters who must, by hypothesis, have no motive but their own ‘natural’ impulses… A dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery. Without the dogma of objective value, no power is possible except tyranny, and no subordination except slavery”.  


Aoyama faces with what sooner or later any inquisitive and honest mind faces - beyond a certain limit, that is limit of rational cognition, beyond the ""end of the world"" lies something unanswered, something which can not be reduced to rationally comprehensible object, and only choice left is either to believe that this Mystery is nothing, chaos, which has no meaning and value, or there follows recognition of the existence of absolute values, axioms that cannot be proven, but on which the Universe and logic are based. He came to the point where, in the words of one of the heroes of ""Solaris"" by Soderbergh, ""there are no answers, only choices"". Aoyama's choice was the recognition of the existence of axioms - the Lady, by herself, is more valuable than trying to solve her Mystery at the expense of harming the Lady. She is not a soulless subject of study, an abstract chaos of the primordial ocean, “nature” which is to be explored and tamed. For Aoyama the Lady is a person, self-containing value, and love for her, which is also rationally incomprehensible, means much more for him than thirst for knowledge or recognition in the scientific world. For Aoyama the Lady, in Buber's words, is not ""It"", but ""Thou"". He doesn’t want her to be harmed. Feeling the threat that other scientists may deny the Lady her self-value and turn her into an abstract subject of scientific research destined to be heartlessly dissected (as it happened with ""visitors"" in ""Solaris""), Aoyama first tries to dissolve his small research circle, so that information about the abilities of the Lady may not become known to other scientists, and finally refuses to reveal the Mystery of the Lady to Hamamoto’s father. Aoyama sacrifices his scientific curiosity and his chance to become famous in order to save the Lady from scientific enquiry.  


There is an anecdote told by Aoyama early on in the movie in which he compares the Lady's breasts and his mother's breasts. As Aoyama mentions, Lady's breasts and his mother's breasts abstractly belong to the same category of objects, but in reality affect him completely differently. That's how problem of reductionist issue of rational cognition may be simply illustrated: objects of scientific study should not be treated as abstractions, but rather as quite specific phenomena, to each of which, despite the quantitative similarity, a special, qualitatively different attitude should be formed. Object, stripped of its qualitative properties and reduced to mere quantity, is not wholly real. Thus main messege of this anime lays in overcoming intellectual arrogance, overcoming reductionism, which paradoxically means returning of Aoyama (and with him the viewer) to childhood, when phenomena are perceived directly, as separate and integral, as values that have their own selves and are not subject to instrumentalization.  


Aoyama's love, openness of mind and honesty with himself allows him to calmly go where many confined scientific minds stumble - either due to self-deception, or weakness of mind, or even maybe due to outright thirst for power and wealth. ""The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. but they were twins. They were born of the same impulse... There is something which unites magic and applied science while separating both from the wisdom of earlier ages. For the wise men of old the cardinal problem had been how to conform the soul to reality, and the solution had been knowledge, self-discipline, and virtue. For magic and applied science alike the problem is how to subdue reality to the wishes of men: the solution is a technique; and both, in the practice of this technique, are ready to do things hitherto regarded as disgusting and impious... You will read in some critics that Faustus has a thirst for knowledge. In reality, he hardly mentions it. It is not truth he wants from the devils, but gold and guns and girls... In the same spirit Bacon condemns those who value knowledge as an end in itself: this, for him, is to use as a mistress for pleasure what ought to be a spouse for fruit. The true object is to extend Man’s power to the performance of all things possible. He rejects magic because it does not work; but his goal is that of the magician"".  


Aoyama is alien to such an approach - he does not seek to use knowledge in order to gain power over the Lady, to subjugate her, to use her for his own purposes against her will. In this sense, he is not a modern scientist, but rather a philosopher in the classical sense, a natural philosopher, or even a theologian. He strives to knowledge only in order to walk along the narrow, accessible only to a few, ""Penguin Highway"" to meet again with the one he loves - with the Lady, to return to the Mystery, beyond the ""end of the world"" - the limits of human rational cognition, where is ""God playing around"". So once selfless monks, exploring the world created by God in search of traces of God, laid the foundations of genuine science in Western European monasteries, which was only later profaned and made practical instead of formerly popular secular magic and alchemy, which were abandoned.  


Another layer of the ""Penguin Highway"" is the interaction between male and female, where the male logic of Aoyama is called upon to unravel and structure chaos - the “primal ocean” which represents feminine principle of the Lady, which is the Mystery, opposite to the light of Aoyama's Logos. After all, the Lady herself does not understand who she is, why she appeared and where she draws her strength from. Like the heroine of “Solaris” she doubts her humanity and reliability of her memories before her meeting with Aoyama - perhaps she is manifestation of the Ocean created out of Aoyama’s dreams. Although the Lady has the energy of the chaos, a huge potential for creation, she is not able to streamline and control it without Aoyama, who brings meaning, structuring the world and Lady's abilities.  


Tarkovsky said that ""Solaris, as it was, materializes the vilest thing that was in these people, as if it moves a mirror towards them, and they are forced to look at themselves... A man and the Ocean, roughly speaking, cannot understand each other for a single moment, because they have nothing in common. And we are talking about the fact that contact - if we can talk about contact - first of all arises here in the soul, in the spiritual sphere: for a man. But as they communicate, something else happens that Kris himself does not expect. From this ""scheme"" Harey - from communication with him - turns into human. She is animated as a result of this feeling of love and became real human being"".  


Indeed, even though Aoyama structured the chaotic nature of the Lady by his rationality (Logos) it is through Aoyama's love the Lady became real human being. Her imitation of Aoyama's strictly rational experimental approach to solving problems (by abstinence from food) leads her to creation of numerous Jabberwocky which ate penguins and thus enlarged the Ocean from which the Lady drew her energy. This ""rational"" yet selfish scientific approach of hers potentially may have lead to the catastrophe. However Aoyama's sheer love and worry for the Lady evoked reciprocal love in her. Love means so much for Aoyama that he even sacrifices his scientific curiosity and his chance to became famous in order to save the Lady from scientific enquiry. She in turn loves Aoyama so much that she sacrifices her presence in his world in order to protect it from destruction. Thus Aoyama's male rationality in interaction with Lady’s female chaos gave it structure and allowed her to understand herself, but it was Aoyama’s love for this alien being (the Lady) which aroused reciprocal love in her and led her to selfless act in order to save Aoyama (in a way, like Harey sacrificed herself in ""Solaris"" in order to save Kris). On the other hand, through love for the Lady, Aoyama is also ""humanizes"" in a way - he goes beyond the boundaries of his ego, overcomes the narrow limits of any egoism, even scientific, and puts Lady's well-being above his own good (when he gets sick, he worries about her more than about himself), learns to understand other people not only logically, but through empathy.  


Symbolically here both male and female became complete through their mutual love - the Lady learns about herself, of how to use her abilities and accepts her responsibility to repair the hole in the Universe, while Aoyama gains empathy and insight through his love for the Lady, realizing that rational analysis and theoretical hypothesis are not the same with reality, that abstract object is something different than particular phenomenon, that not all mysteries should or could be solved and that if they should, they must be treated carefully in order to avoid harm. He grew up through realization that answers he seeks for, including the answer to his love for the Lady, lie not in the field of rational cognition.  


The other characters of the anime reacts differently to the Ocean, which represents different approaches among humans to the Unknown - fear (Uchida), aggression (Suzuki), strictly abstract interest complicated by jealousy (Hamamoto), etc. But there is no dialogue between these different points of view like in the movie interpretations of “Solaris”. Aoyama does not seek to convince anyone of the humanity of the Lady, unlike Kris, who is trying to prove, first of all, to himself, the humanity of Harey. Aoyama, on the other hand, simply acts out of strong convictions. And the mood of “Penguin Highway” is completely different than that of “Solaris” - bright, similar to the sad joy of the last days of summer with the sound of “Summer Moved On” by a-ha.  


There are many psychological observations in this movie regarding childhood (first love, relationship with parents, openness of mind, dealing with bullies, awareness of mortality, etc.), but it would be a mistake to consider ""Penguin Highway"" as a coming of age story. Indeed there is no development of Aoyama's character - the anime opens and ends with the pretty much the same speech of the protagonist. In fact ""Penguin Highway"" represents idea which is opposite to coming of age. It is about returning to innocence, to child-like pure heart, open-mindeness and to the immediate perception of the world. The only scientist (Dr. Kris Kelvin) in the “Solaris” who managed to establish contact with the Ocean did it not through rational observation, but through empathy - he established emotional connection with Solaris through his deceased wife, recreated by Solaris. Yet as her death was his guilt (at least he blamed himself) this connection could not last long as both of them were tortured by Kris' guilt. So the only solution for Kris to reach Solaris was to return to his roots, return to his home and innocence - to childhood. Solaris materialized his dream by creating his old family house and his father on the Ocean's surface - it was clear reference to the ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"". Tarkovsky's movie begins and ends on Earth, in the protagonist's house.  


We can find reference to this in the anime, when the Lady tells Aoyama in his dream that ""she has always been on Earth"" as well as river which ends where it begins and words that ""everything ends and returns to where it started"". ""If you go far enough, you return to where you started"" says the Lady to Aoyama, stating that she is on Earth despite Aoyama's travel to another planet. While saying good bye to him later in the movie, she hints that he'll be able to solve her mystery after becoming astronaut and going to space - ""then I want you to come and find me"". This also alludes to Kris' returning to home from the space in order to reach his ideal, but in the same way this ""returning"" of Kris was symbolic as in reality he comes to replica of his home which was artificially recreated by Solaris as Kris at last become able to establish communication with the Ocean through empathy.  


Aoyama is virtually Kris which has returned to his childhood, with clear conscience, highly intelligent but still innocent. The Ocean (manifested in the Lady) and Aoyama also established connection not through rationality, but through empathy, through mutual love, which gave common ground to completely alien beings. For Aoyama the same ""returning to home"", returning to the Ocean by penguin highway (it is a path by which penguins go to and from the ocean), in other words reaching his ideal (the Lady), means to grow up ""good adult"" not just intellectually, but first of all morally, through realization of limitations of rational cognition. Thus Aoyama’s growing up lays through overcoming rational reductionism which in a way means returning to childhood when phenomena precepted immediately as particular and whole. The answer to the Mystery lies out of the reach of scientific approach in the rationally incomprehensible sphere of human spirit and only through devoted love and determined strive for the Lady Aoyama may be able to reunite with her - the Mystery.  


However, the complex epistemological message of the ""Penguin Highway"" will not at all prevent you from enjoying watching this anime without understanding its meaning at all. Many will enjoy the bright, beautifully drawn summer adventure, the feeling of childhood, enchanting music and the atmosphere of a fairy tale, the psychological observations, the relationship between children and parents, not to mention the unusual, humorous and loving relationship between Aoyama and the Lady (however, in order to perceive this unusual relationship, many may need to experience the same level of struggle with stereotypes of thinking and accept openness to the perception of the unknown, as scientists in their study of Solaris). Someone may perceive this anime as a children's fairy tale or a coming of age story, someone as magical realism, a surreal adventure or a first love story - all these will not interfere with enjoying this wonderful masterpiece. This movie is so unusual and magical that it easily became my favorite anime. ",1b0n4zp,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/InDepthAnimeReview/comments/1b0n4zp/penguin_highway/,[]

The post in question, ""Arethrurea,"" is of the ""Images & Video"" kind offered through this platform and website company called Reddit dot com, being hosted for me and for us in an abstract memory on the opened Internet, a so-called 'subreddit' or affinity community centered around dissidence from spectator roles & conceptual arbitration against dominator heritages of psychic control/repression.

This schism from the closing society is into the opening society, which is to say we are simply opening our eyes and awakening to the deadening eyelids of an enemy's territory. An enemy's, yes: for who is one's friend who takes one's mind for hostage, who steals one's myth & perverts it with false sciences?

Open a potato chip bag and fart hard into it: this is not your wakeup to the conference call committee. This is just a summary of the piece ""Arethrurea,"" on this subreddit dot com, which I made in a state of quarantine that happened well before the pandemic.

**This** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/societyoftheschism/comments/1az5fh2/arethrurea_a_graphical_user_innerspace_for_hidden/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **Is About Hard Truths**

Arethrurea has nine pages, each a JPEG image uploaded in sequence to produce what Chat GPT would probably called something like ""an abstract and disjointed narrative sequence"" comprising several phases. 

[Arethrurea pg. 1](https://preview.redd.it/t3xopdb8qykc1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a9195a439f4f497a2f9cde085ebb0f6488143ae)

The first phase introduces the protagonist character, a member of the anthropomorphic cockroach royalty, pictorially represented by superimposed snippets of copy-&-pasted images depicting the visage of the author, haggard and beheaded-seeming, glued on, as it were, top the somehow-cleaner-seeming stock image of a cockroach. Roc monologues on the existential point of view of such an absurd being as he, awakened to a perceptiveness on what amounts to a fool's history (the history of those desperate enough to be fooled, for those sated enough to fool them.) 

The second phase witnesses Roc conducting a spiritual or psychological exchange with a body of water near which he has just alighted. More is revealed here about the distant past of such a strange creature's history and world; shown are the abstract technical remains of an hominid culture, who now would be called posthumans, but who were then called ""the Idlemaen"" (I also have written on this theme one act of a five-act Shakespearean play, which for reasons of finance I have been unable to settle time for and renew to completion its frame.)

[Arethrurea, pg. 4](https://preview.redd.it/fx95njqnqykc1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7ab331c86fa09fe185c257d53d3f5619b36f777)

The Idlemaen 'seeded' the 'sods and soils' of the cockroach empire. This means that the entire planet is imbued with sentience in its very sediments, as though our descendants, proudly expiating our primeval shame as much-less-advanced and more-primitive predecessors, successfully emptied themselves (i.e. via ""[kenosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenosis#:~:text=The%20term%20kenosis%20comes%20from,to%20plerosis%2C%20fullness%20(Hippocrates))"") into the meteorological, biological, eschatological processes of fate on at least the planet Earth, and maybe far beyond as well. (Perhaps they just left and decided the best thing to do with the parent planet was to leave it in the most interesting state of permanent decay achievable with minimum maintenance requirement, and thus said, ""Let Earth be finally ruled by the lowest of beings."")

In the third phase of the sequence, Roc makes contact with a Thought or Entity taking shape in the consciousness underneath the surface of the water, where he has been pulled and briefly drowned. He meets the entity saying the name ""I AM"" over and over again, not responsive to the questioning of Roc on behalf of us idly scavenging the poetry of such unpleasant scenes.

[Arethrurea, pg. 5](https://preview.redd.it/caxtq9wjqykc1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01e060fc318b822111eba66dc468c1cc7dcecfc0)

The meeting with God, with the Idlemaen Source of Creation, this endlessly upgrading feedback device in the environment has been placed in the future by the past for the purposes of useless reproduction. It is obviously a thing held esteemed by its author, me, and it is shared here for no money and on purpose just to break out, not break through. 

Such wealth is there in the idea of future scenes that a host of hoarding homers have abandoned their very humanity in pursuit of us, in dogmatic conceit of trust. Landlorders, go home! Leave us to our own business, for we have not need of yours! This is argued to be an ethical slogan worth considering as an antecedent to posthuman virtue and ethics–the permission to be absolutely free while also fair. 

[Arethrurea, pg. 7](https://preview.redd.it/4pu43b5uqykc1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfecb28a02eda9214a0901557d431b254500440f)

In the fourth phase of the sequence, Roc awakes to the reassuring visage of another cockroach, expert in medicine, who asks after Roc's experience of pain and who, inexplicably and without context, offers Roc directions to his next destination, giving him a quest, seemingly, as though a friendly NPC or aide.

The last page in the slide show is an exhortation to the reader/viewer to offer commentary and argue whether the piece is any good, while apologizing for wasting the time of the viewer and promising they may recoup it by simply ""returning to your hurrying necessities."" 

[Arethrurea, last page.](https://preview.redd.it/21ejp6exqykc1.jpg?width=1176&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=850dbd97faa82a7a3eea0fdf36f4550415feda66)

**What does it all mean?**

I recommend to experience the piece as a trance or sedative-state vision. It is not assailing your presence and your station, but it is calling all, both Jamie Dimon and Elon Musk, as well as the rest of them, all one trillion and eighty seven of you people, to look ahead, not up, to look inside, not on: our hidden television has an impressive screen.

The future belongs to all of us who shall inherit the consequences of our past and present actions, who must bury, burn, or study us. We must borrow for them their bones and reapportion their insides and outsides. We must completely annihilate our shame and protect our furies. Aaron Bushnell of San Antonio Texas an Airman of the US Air Force immolated himself in front of the Israel Embassy in Washington D.C. today; the last words I heard of his in the video were ""Free Palestine!"" and he screamed like Joan of Arc probably did, maybe less. It was shorter than I think I expected, a minute supposedly before the secret service cops put out the fire with a second fire extinguisher for his flame. The whole time, Aaron, your colleague, some secret service cop, had his gun drawn on you, as though your weapon wasn't already drawn and discharged, as though the fire now fought you, and your hand had to handle a weapon. (You don't have shields anymore.) 

It means that I was shitting some tension into the text box and some of it found its way into your screen, like we users were of some common-sought communist toilet system, our milky way.

It means that a schism is just this very same sort of shitting. 

**Epilogue**  


>I feel this was shit out, like it was the outcome of a quite satisfying shitting.

I realize that my last two sentence areas were really vague and made a sudden transition to the analogy of shitting that I wanted to explain and for you to understand.

A schism is like a shitting more than it is like a milking or a shooting. It is like a shitting because it is a shedding of internalized forms, it is highly carnal, like it pertains the experience of desire with bodies, and it is highly mysterious; only those who have shitted as animals shit need apply for this position. 

A schism is shedding all pretense, is taking risks with agony and with shame, for the reason that one either exists in such a way as to contest and thwart the tragedy of one's living negation, or one's life is negated, becomes a negative expression of what shouldn't be.

Thus, shit out your spoilage! Your worthless, unsaleable utterances: stack them in the stained pits of your useless greed. Your homebody entrails, reattached to your wrist, hunt on words haunting onward  their century's myths.

Fairy Tale Spotlight: Casino Royale [1967 Film Review],"""Casino Royale"" is a James Bond 007 movie released in 1967. It is possibly the strangest Bond Film to ever be released and may possibly be one of the oddest films ever to be made period. Is it a good film? Is it bad? It's hard to say really. Even though the movie was a box office success, opinions on the film have been all over the place since its release.

&#x200B;

Although the movie is based on the book of the same name by Ian Flemming, the film itself does everything in its power to break up what it means to have a Bond film. It utterly destroys conventions in any way it can. For one, James Bond can barely stand being around women. Women make him nervous, and he tends to stutter around them a lot too. That said, he is still straight and even has a woman who he still feels loyal too who had since been murdered.

&#x200B;

The reason for this sudden change in character is attributed to the other movies which make him seem like a very silly, gadget-using, womanizer. But see... this movie is a comedy. The whole point is to make fun of itself, and it does that for the full run. But even as a comedy, this movie works very hard to sell what it is to an often baffled audience. It somehow comes across as sincerity.

&#x200B;

The music was another aspect of the film that nobody will expect. It often sounds like circus music even in places where it doesn't seem to belong. The quality is good, and some of the action scenes can feel more fun with the silly music somehow. It's hard to explain without being able to show it to you.

&#x200B;

The writing is all over the place and filled with stuff that strays from the main story. This happens often. There is also a level of convolution as well. Even though there is only one James Bond, the real Bond hires a bunch of agents and forces them to use the same moniker as him just to confuse the enemy. So nearly ever main character in the film will be known as James Bond by the end of it.

&#x200B;

Despite all the chaos in the writing, the presentation is shockingly good. There are a ton of celebrities, the set design is always first class, and the acting, such as it is, is spot on for what they are trying to do. The humor is all incredibly straight-faced and dry, which sometimes can lead to the confusion of if something was meant to be funny to begin with. If it is possible for humor to be dry then this movie is a desert.

&#x200B;

Much of the latter half of the movie gets extremely surreal and almost hypnotic in its presentation. There is this weird facility that trains double agents for both Russia and America. This whole section of the movie feels like a strange dream. The torture scene of Bond was replaced with an equally surreal scene where Le Chiffe uses a mind control device to torture one of Bond's many doubles, causing him to think he is going insane. ""Why do any of this?"" I asked. Because they wanted to and so they did.

&#x200B;

This movie is the product of a bunch of people having a silly idea, and then pumping as much money and effort into it as they could. What came of it was a movie more fascinating in that it exists than it existing as a comedy that's mildly funny. The movie, at least in my own opinion, is good because it fascinates the brain for the entire time you are watching it. But on its own merits as a film, it appears to be a bad movie.

&#x200B;

""Casino Royale"" might be chaos in its construction, but it also seems to have been very carefully made with love. It's a movie worth seeing, and I do recommend that you see it at least once. You may like it or hate it, but you'll have to admit that it is one of the most novel movies you will ever see in your life. And seriously if you watch it for anything, watch it for the group of henchwomen wielding Sterling submachine guns. That sight never gets old.

Synth Riders is great!,"I have it on Quest and, yes, it feels better with the controllers both for the tracking rate and also the haptic feedback.

HOWEVER, based on multiple reviews I thought that the experience would be bad on AVP and that's not the case AT ALL.

Hand tracking works totally fine and the gameplay feels solid! I enjoyed it.

Does it feel better with controllers? For sure... but after playing it I feel more optimistic with gaming in general with AVP.

Anything with guns or more complex controls will requiere controllers but simpler control schemes will work just fine.

Looking forward to Job/Vacation Simulator on AVP... I think those will be great.

&#x200B;",1b0mrrr,28,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1b0mrrr/synth_riders_is_great/,"['I would expect to hear a lot more about this game considering it seems like possibly the best game for the AVP so far in a category that is very popular in VR and very accessible. It’s also free with Apple Arcade.\n\nIt has all the elements to be a huge hit, but I barely hear about it so far. It’s weird.', 'Hmm, I have a different experience with synth riders due to the lag I can enjoy the game. I own it on synth riders on both the AVP and Q3, the controller tracks faster on Q3 than the hand on AVP for this game.', ""it's good, but the problem is, Beat Saber is better"", 'I gotta go back and try this one again. The tracking felt a bit loose the first time I played.', ""I noticed only lag when you're looking directly at your hands and moving them around briskly. The spheres lag behind a bit, however I didn't notice it while playing. It doesn't seem to affect gameplay."", 'Yeah I’m surprised as well, I really enjoy this.', 'I love this game, especially the music!', 'Daptap is even better and the best game on Vision Pro so far.', 'Yeah Synth Riders is a lot of the fun and the spatial part of it is really cool, also it’s higher fidelity than the other versions', 'It felt very laggy to me']"

Former Times Union journalist Rob Port died last week. He helped edit the Secrets of NXIVM series for the Times Union. He had some secrets himself.,"*Many thanks to* u/2Djinn *and* u/ProtectionKey2069 *for tips that were helpful to this.*

The journalist J. Robert ""Rob"" Port [died earlier this week at the age of 68](https://apnews.com/article/robert-port-obituary-ap-pulitzer-1556f680440fa52050c7654bb826b5c0). He was living in Lansing, Michigan, where he was undergoing cancer treatment.

In his career Port was a co-winner of a Pulitzer for reporting on U.S. atrocities committed in the Korean War. For this forum, however, he may be known for the accomplishments as well as the controversies tied to the *Times Union*'s 2012 investigative reporting series ""[Secrets of NXIVM](https://blog.timesunion.com/readandreact/1565/secrets-of-nxivm-the-untold-story-of-keith-raniere/)"", where he served as editor over the team of Jennifer Gish and Jim Odato.

Though *Forbes* aired the absurdities of NXIVM's personality cult to Keith Raniere in 2003, ""Secrets of NXIVM"" in 2012 was the first time many came forward for the truly scandalous stories about NXIVM and Raniere: his harem of women, his secret love-child (whom members were told was a foundling), and most infamously his pursuit of underage girls.

Odato, Gish, and Port's work had tangible results. One unknown to any of them at the time stands out: the exposure of the *Times Union* series persuaded cult it had to do some damage control, resulting in Daniela's release from her solitary confinement. 

# Curious Omissions Continue at the Times Union

Setting NXIVM's secret captive free may be as close as any journalistic outfit will ever get to the ideal of comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. That is far from the full story, however. And in some places, the lack of a story *is* the story. 

For instance: Port's death did not prompt the *Times Union* to write their own obituary. They ran an Associated Press version instead.

This adds to the *Times Union's* strange silent treatment towards the 2012 investigative series about NXIVM, as well as the staff who wrote it. In the past, the *Times Union* published [self-congratulatory videos about their decades-long coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z34rdfFgHM8) of NXIVM, only to be chided by [downstate tabloid rival *New York Daily News*](https://www.reddit.com/r/theNXIVMcase/comments/jjnvxq/a_media_accountabiility_moment_ny_daily_news/) about the lack of credit to Gish and Odato.

I believe a set of circumstances explains the Times Union's selective memory-holing of one of its most important stories. It does not speak well of Port.

# Sheriff Apple and the Snake in the Garden

The ""Secrets of NXIVM"" series was published in February 2012. Port's personal legal issues began the next month --without apparent nexus to NXIVM, but with the story soon to cross over into that territory.

In March 2012, Albany Sheriff Craig Apple [raided Green Garden Asian Spa](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/nyregion/albany-times-union-editor-says-police-targeted-his-wifes-spa.html). Like many such spas, Green Garden had the reputation as a house of ill-repute or (in more modern parlance a [rub-and-tug](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rub%20and%20tug)).  Arrested in the raid was one masseuse, an alleged prostitute. Port was not a client; he was, rather, the husband of the owner/proprietor.

Publicly, Port professed the innocence of his wife and the masseuse. Neither was criminally charged; only the masseuse was. Nonetheless, Port left the *Times Union* some time in 2013 under a cloud. 

It took until summer 2015 for the legal issues of the raid to boil over. That's when the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/nyregion/albany-times-union-editor-says-police-targeted-his-wifes-spa.html) and [*Albany Times Union*](https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/three-years-later-prostitution-case-is-thrown-out-6422927.php) noted that the case from the 2012 raid had fallen apart. Port would claim to the *Times* that the raids were ""a carefully planned plot to retaliate against me and my newspaper"" --not for its coverage of NXIVM, mind, but for his coverage of the vice squad of the Albany Sheriff.

But Port's denials may not have been entirely candid: the *Times* and *Times Union*'s articles trumpeting Port and his wife's exoneration omitted to mention that Port's wife was involved in *yet another* massage parlor --[one, as documented by the Times Union, raided in *January 2015*](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Sex-ring-busted-6020571.php)*,* as part of a county-wide crackdown against traffickers. 

Though Port and his wife were not prosecuted, they were implicated: two women were arrested in the raid for prostitution, and both were living in a house owned by Port's wife in Flushing, Queens. 

It is unclear what conclusion that case ever reached. 

# The Vanguard Strikes Back

While Port's issues had no apparent connection to NXIVM, ""Secrets of NXIVM"" led to an undeniable wave of retaliation against the *Times Union* and its sources by NXIVM's legal team, who were willing to put every resource into the effort.

Most notably, this included civil and criminal complaints of ""computer trespass"" --none of which would ever stand up in court-- against various journalists and foes of NXIVM. There were raids and suits and court cases galore, none of which accomplished the stated ends of punishing a supposed hacking.

Yet the sheer tidal wave of litigation had its consequences. Neither Joe O'Hara nor John Tighe ""hacked"" NXIVM, but only threw rhetorical stones at the cult from their own glass houses --O'Hara was involved in a non-NXIVM related fraud; Tighe had severe issues with hoarding child sexual abuse material. None of their crimes can be excused, but it is hard to argue that either have gotten into in as much trouble without NXIVM's pursuit.   

Other targets, like Toni Natalie and Jim Odato, were blameless but nevertheless were subjected to severe disruptions of their lives and livelihoods because of their vulnerabilities. Natalie, already targeted out of sheer spite by Raniere, [was raided and was continuously being sued](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2018/03/08/rochester-woman-battles-nxivm-keith-raniere/360847002/) until Raniere himself was finally arrested. And stemming from NXIVM's spurious accusations, Odato was basically [drummed out](https://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/11/journalist-on-leave-after-tangle-with-secretive-nxivm-group-003145/) of the *Times Union* and has suffered *damnatio memoriae* far worse than what commonly passes for ""cancel culture.""

# ""All a Smear Campaign""

Tying this all together, I am led to believe that Port was blemished by something far worse than marriage to an alleged madam. At best, Port may have been caught in a scheme where he gave NXIVM collateral-style blackmail material. At worst, Port may have betrayed those who put their trust in him and the *Times Union* with confidentiality.

**Exhibit 1: The (Missing?) Tape**

Listeners to the Times Union's *NXIVM on Trial* podcast may remember a very uncomfortable moment in [the episode with Nippy Ames and Sarah Edmondson](https://pod.link/1462352368/episode/2d87e3dc6927e735e12061e6d0b7187f) when she mentions this to the hosts Casey Seiler and Rob Gavin. Paraphrased heavily:

>I remember Clare Bronfman coming into a meeting \[. . .\] and saying she was so relieved. Basically she'd gone in to interview somebody, and they had somebody who was dying of cancer or something --does this sound familiar like a high up person at the *Times Union?*  
>  
>I remember her saying that she'd gone in with Marc Vicente \[and\] filmed him admitting on his deathbed that it was all untrue and was all a smear campaign, and this she was so happy because this was going to vindicate \[NXIVM\] and prove that we were under attack. Then later the footage was lost.

Edmondson's question is followed by nervous laughs from Seiler and Gavin. They shrug off answering and imply that Bronfman simply told Edmondson a tall tale. I was inclined to believe them at the time. But today, knowing the context, I don't think this is entirely fiction.

The ""high up person"" does sound like Rob Port --who, as noted in his obituary, was a longtime cancer patient. And last year --not long before her decision to flee Dossier Project, in fact-- [Nicki Clyne said she saw this video](https://archive.is/8RHfa), and [she explicitly named Port](https://archive.is/ebIDa) as the man in it.

None of the key facts are known for sure (yet). Did Port give a statement? Was it recorded? I can't tell. But the chilling effect of Port repudiating his own work could not be denied: it would have added to Gish and Odato's legal jeopardy. It would certainly account for how gun-shy the *Times Union* became from Odato's dismissal in 2014 until the *Frank Report* / *New York Times'*s scoops in 2017. 

Crucially, the period of 2014 until 2017 is when Keith Raniere's brilliant idea for DOS came about. If Port capitulated and put the *Times Union* in check, that would certainly have contributed to his sense that he was bulletproof.  

**Exhibit 2: The Lawyer**

A more tangible tie between Port and NXIVM seems to have gone unnoted except in a few places, but may have been the means of having him betray his sources and his colleagues. Reports on the massage parlor raids note that Port, his wife, and at least one woman arrested all shared one lawyer: Kevin Luibrand of Latham, NY.  

Luibrand has a long legal career, having been admitted to the bar in 1984, and so he may be well traveled. But one prior client of Luibrand stands out: [Executive Success Programs](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4521747/nxivm-corporation-v-the-ross-institute/). And that representation was in NXIVM's case against Rick Alan Ross, aimed at censoring Ross and other experts from criticizing NXIVM's training materials. 

Luibrand's work for NXIVM was, in fact, [covered by the *Times Union* itself](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Group-sues-its-critics-over-claims-it-is-a-cult-15640376.php) in 2003 --meaning it's unlikely Port or the Times Union staff were unaware of the conflict of interest. 

As to the extent of his work for NXIVM, Luibrand worked on injunctions against Ross early on, but ceased working for this suit in 2004. But it wasn't unremembered. A transcript from a deposition has [Keith Raniere mentioning Luibrand's work for the cult](https://culteducation.com/pdf/nxivm/FILED%202009-03-11_K.%20Raniere%20Deposition%20Transcript%20(Confidential).pdf), unbeckoned. Including, I should note, the use of taped confessions. 

This deposition was for the case against Ross in 2009, after it was removed from the Northern District of New York to the District of New Jersey. This version of the lawsuit was the same one for which Nancy Salzman was convicted on the charge of altering videotaped evidence. And it has had a bizarre afterlife, in no small part thanks to bickering between NXIVM's lawyers and their investigators. 

About investigations: how much of his notes did Port ever give Luibrand? And how much did Luibrand give Raniere?

# Time to Break Silence

This is where we end. I admit I do not have much except a very nagging suspicion about the late Port having possibly been turned, or at least coaxed into some very regrettable decisions. It is difficult to grapple with. 

But having this pulpit (small, albeit with great search engine optimization), I would like to ask some difficult questions for the living --namely, the staff at *Times Union* and the ex-NXIVM community.

What was the Times Union's knowledge of Port's connections to the spas and the circumstances of his separation from the Times Union in 2013? Did he truly jump, or was he pushed --and was it for good cause?

Did the Times Union knew about Port retaining someone with substantial ties (and duties of representation) to NXIVM, and were confidential sources who confided in Port ever warned of this?

Then there is the NXIVM survivor community, specifically Mark Vicente (and any others with knowledge): what is to make about the alleged deathbed confession of Port? Did he, in fact, ever say that his own work was all a smear campaign? And if so, what was the context of such a statement?",1b0mijq,12,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/theNXIVMcase/comments/1b0mijq/former_times_union_journalist_rob_port_died_last/,"['""Edmondson\'s question is followed by nervous laughs from Seiler and Gavin.

She doesn\'t even claim that she saw it. she claims that somebody told her they saw it. Frankly it has the ridiculous and fantastical ring of the exact sort of thing NXIVMs would be told about so-called suppressives that they would repeat and I wouldn\'t be surprised if you asked Nikki Clyne today she would also say she had heard it from somebody else.  \nBut the bigger question is what does all of it mean?']"

**Bright City - The War**

Been ten days since Big Cheddar died. Ten days since half the city crawled out of glitched sleep tubes. All dry and half dead. Woke to a city leveled. And a war that was out of drones and looking for bodies.

Kyle had gone to sleep as a low level enforcer for Crypto Bro. Which was a pretty dicey position

after the Tournament Riot. The Cheddardrome and the Immobile Market were both out for blood. Mostly each other’s, but they didn’t like Crypto Bro either.

He’d got in a tube, hoping things would blow over while he slept. But when he woke, half dead in a ruined city, he’d been handed a gun and a bottle of water. Never told what side he was on - just the mission. Champion-bots had turned the arena into a post-apocalyptic pizza empire. They must be destroyed. Apparently.

Kyle had never liked Champion, and wasn’t against his destruction, but he wasn’t keen to be a part of the operation. Especially now that there were hundreds of Champion-bots. Unfortunately, his desires were not deemed mission critical. He fought, because the punishment for cowardice was death. What kind of world kills you for wanting to live? Two for flinching run amok.

Sometimes they rushed the walls of Pizza Empire. Sometimes they ambushed Champions out on cheese runs. They lost either way. Chucking soldiers into graves. The odd Champion got shredded, but it was never worth it. Kyle survived by luck, and by keeping an eye on his commanding officer. Soon as he got fragged, it was safe to run.

Days turned into weeks. Miserable, starving, terrified, and shell shocked. It was all so futile. Fucking Champions would sometimes charge through their derelict camps, killing no one, just to leave a few pizzas. Who does that? Fucking psychological warfare. They smelt so good.

Of course they couldn’t be eaten. Had to be poisoned, or something. Mind control. The

officers shot anyone who touched them. Confiscated. Burned, they said. Or were the officers having pizza parties? There were rumors. Some g

uys had eaten the pizza. It was fine. Smelled so good. Why not eat it? Prolly fight better full of baked cheese.

Or was the box the problem? LAY DOWN YOUR GUNS. JOIN US. That’s what the boxes said. Officers couldn’t hide that. But they reframed it. Of course they want you to lay down your guns. Easier to kill you. Think there’s enough pizza for everyone? Their take was depressingly rational.

Kyle is very tired. His body, of course, but also his emotions. How long can you be terrified? Today’s officer gets fragged, but Kyle does not run. Where would he go? The Champion looms over him. Kyle lays his gun to ground. He’s not looking to switch sides. He’s done. Past that.

Except the Champion also walks past. Leaves Kyle behind. Doesn’t even take his gun. Kyle sobs. What now, what now, what now? Can’t go forward, can’t go back, why won’t this end?

That’s when the Valkyrie found him. The chrome goddess lifted him from the battlefield. Carried him through the walls he’d assaulted so many times. Through the lines at last. Rest easy, son. For you, the fight is done.

There’s no violence in the Pizza Empire. And there is enough pizza for everyone. You can eat it all day. There’s some yelling and crying, which freaks Kyle out - especially when he’s the one doing it - but nothing ever comes of it. No one wants anything from him. He’s allowed to eat pizza and be a mess.

He makes some friends. Takes a lover. She’s all fucked up too. They fix each other. Not really. But they like each other. And neither yells when the other cries.

One day, he realizes that he’s safe. How odd.

Kyle has everything he’s ever wanted. He’s happy. But… Dunno… Shouldn’t he be happier? Is there something wrong with him?

The Valkyrie returns. “There’s people trying to get to the Empire. Kinda. They’re too scared to make the trip. Somebody has to go get them.”

Fuck.

Kyle chews on this. Tells his lover. Someone got them when they were scared. Is it their turn to be Valkyries? Fuckity-fuck. They volunteer. Back to war. Or maybe not. They’re directed to the top level of the city structure. There’s a sneaky way to accomplish the mission. Apparently.

The top level of the Pizza Empire is a huge warehouse full of drones, bots, guns, and sleep tubes. Oh no. They’re introduced to the man in charge of the operation. A slim fellow with villainous facial hair, called Xan.

Oh no no no no.

“Hey dude! Do I know you? Doesn’t matter. Got people to save. Hop in a sleep tube. We’ll get mission ready on the other side.”

Kyle’s lover hops in a tube, but he hesitates. “Last time I crawled out of a sleep tube I was almost dead.”

Xan nods. Gives solemn finger guns. “That sucks. But this is a professional fucking operation. We’re here to save lives.”

Kyle nods. Gets in a tube.

\--------

He wakes. Coughs. Feels awful. Sore. Tired. Little, frail, and old. Oh Jesus. Not again.

Kyle struggles with a cocoon of greasy sheets in a dark and dingy room. A slim villainous woman watches as he slowly fails to get out of bed.

“Hi, I’m Xan.”

“You said I wouldn’t wake up nearly dead.”

“Yeah, I lied.”

“So there aren't people who need my help?”

“There’s fuck tons of people who need help. I only lie to make things sound better. If I say everything’s fucked, it’s probably double super fucked.” She pauses. Nods. “So yeah, let’s get you fixed up, then get to work.”

Ranked incentive rewards are a temporary solution,"I’ve been hearing a lot of talk from the community about their dissatisfaction with ranked and its incentives. Many are struggling to stay motivated but the lack of motivation to play the game goes well beyond not receiving a new gun buddy or gun skin. From no-comm lobbies to throwers to minimal effort from teammates, all of these things have negatively impacted the ranked experience. I personally believe these rewards won’t have a lasting impact on the community. And although  VALORANT may be lacking in content and can improve in many different areas (report system, ranked, special events, replay system etc,) the “solution” I find myself constantly coming back to is this; Improving the ranked system begins with you. I don’t see this “meta” of ranked ever improving without the community making a conscious effort to change it. We are a reflection of our environment so the more we normalize not caring the more people will seize to care. We have to lead by example and influence people to maintain the integrity of competition. Your actions have impact and you can set the tone for every lobby you get into. 

Don’t get me wrong, this method does not guarantee anything. You can have the best intentions and yet it probably won’t change much in the moment. Thats okay. Change takes time. There’s very few things you have control over in VALORANT. You may not control whether you win or lose every game or what teammates you end up with but you can at least control the amount of effort YOU bring to each game. Your effort is serving a greater purpose down the line. It’s great that people want change and are unhappy with the current state of things. It means they care! We care. Next time you queue ranked I implore you to think about how you can make the experience better for everyone and most importantly remember to have fun. Don’t take yourself or others too seriously!

"Out of Cruel Space Side Story: Of Dog, Volpir, and Man - Bk 5 Ch 63","Jerry

Jerry steps away from the holo table. They'd moved to another location than their old digs, expecting that they'd get attacked by the bad girls and their friends after the raid, but even in the 'safe' confines of Old One Eye and her relatively secure hangar, Jerry was concerned. Very concerned. His eyes are locked on the map of the station, the red marks scattered around the map all concerning... but the last one. The one Diana had placed. The one at the data center... It was really bothering him.

""Ghorza.""

""Yeah, babe?""

""You, the Princess and Zraloc handle the majority of the girls. You know the plan, get out there, coordinate with local security forces and our people and take out the trash.""

""And where will you be?"" Ghorza arches an eyebrow, smirking just a little. She knew. She still wanted him to say it.

""I'm going to take Neysihen, Purisha, Dar'Vok, Nadiri and Makula and we're going to scope out that data center. Best case scenario everything is fine and we move on... but something's bothering me and I'm going to trust my gut on this one. Diana, still on the line?""

""Of course.""

""Get yourself into the station's ops center. You can help coordinate our people with the church's security force... and protect the Mother Superior and the Canonness. I can't imagine the terrorists aren't going to take a swipe at them.""

""On it hubby. You can count on me.""

Diana signs off with a casual salute and Jerry looks around, checking the status of his troops by eye. Friends. Family. It was a very different kind of military force out here... and losses, already bad back home when you didn't have such special ties with your best troopers were nightmarish, but everyone looked good. Looked ready.

Even Makula, her arm mostly healed up with a little axiom based help from Cascka seems far more confident than Jerry had seen her before. Apparently the young Cannidor woman had come through her first combat test in good spirits. Ready for more. All of the younger girls seemed ready... and Jerry could only take a moment to pray that he'd get to continue to watch over them as they developed into the next generation of warriors and leaders.

Ghorza gets his attention with a look of concern in her eyes.

""You're not taking any power armor with you.""

""If I'm wrong we won't need it, if I'm right we're bringing more bodies and we'll be hitting them from stealth anyway so we should have an advantage. We'll also call for back up first thing.""

""I'd still feel better if you waited for your suit to be prepped.""

Jerry shakes his head. ""My armor was one of the first ones put in storage. They haven't even pulled it out yet and Cora needs to lift to help Tyler, Cassie and this synth girl who's helping them deal with those fighters. I'm plenty durable in my hard suit and we've got plenty of weapons between us to make things happen.""

Ghorza sighs, then smiles at her husband. ""I had to try at least, but you've answered my concerns... but you better come home to us, or Syl's gonna kill me, then bring us both back to life so she can kill us again.""

Jerry leans in and kisses Ghorza, hard and deep, leaving a woozy smile on her face before she gets her game face back on.

""We just have to be better than the enemies, and we're all very good at what we do, right ladies?.""

A roar of approval followed by another quick ready check and Jerry makes the hand signal to move out.

""Alright, let's step off. Remember. Fast, hard. Communicate with local security forces. We're all working together and the security forces know about us, so if you take an air car you'll be automatically let through checkpoints so long as you signal with the appropriate IFF code. Those codes are either in your communicators or implants. Don't let up and don't stop. Once a site is secure, check if anyone needs help, or move to the next objective that doesn't have one our teams tasked to it yet. There's billions of lives riding on us, to include our own friends and family on the Tear herself. Failure is not an option.""

Vera steps forward, grinning. ""You forget sir. We're Paladin company... and friends. Failure is something that happens to other people.""

Jerry nods. ""Then let's show the galaxy just who we are and how we do business!""

The cheer in response is quieter and more restrained than when he was taking the battalion out on an orbital assault like back in the Alaqin system. Everyone already has their game faces on and is clearly ready to rock and roll. Jerry would just have to pray they didn't need it.

There's a mad scramble as various groups race off Old One Eye and head towards their assignments, with Jerry's motley crew of young women and a particularly active shadow on the wall being last off the ramp. Almost immediately the ramp seals behind them and Old One Eye's engines start up, leaving Jerry and the girls scrambling to clear the hangar.

With the door sealed and Old One Eye off to show some bad girls that cargo ships can dog fight too, Jerry is organizing his team, initializing their comm channels and tagging in his favorite support hacker.

""Babydoll, you on the net?""

""You betcha, skipper!""

""Good, keep an ear out for this frequency. If my gut is right I think we're going to need computer support badly.""

""No problem, I even have clearance codes for the station's systems now! Legit ones even! The church's electronic warfare girls have been super helpful. I'll be here when you need me!""

""Appreciated as always, Babydoll. Keep up the good work.""

""Aye aye, skipper!""

They head through the Grand Bazaar towards the nearest transit hub that would get them to pillar two at a fast pace, keeping to cover to avoid leaving themselves open to ambush. Neysihen and Purisha were out in front, scouting for the team in theory even though they were maintaining a relatively close interval. In these kinds of tight quarters getting too spread out could be just as bad as bunching up.

Dar'Vok was to his immediate right, looking around vigilantly, less in the name of attacking an ambusher, and more to ensure she had time to step between Jerry and the threat. Nadiri was in his shadow, and Makula was bringing up the rear, with a replenished load of ammo for the massive 40mm shotgun she'd borrowed from Zraloc and a clear will to use what was obviously her favorite new toy.

Still, something was wrong. Something was bothering him as they move into one of the more open areas near the transit hub. He could feel eyes on him even when there wasn't anything around... just that slightly paranoid sensation that indicates the human adrenal system's ramping up and getting you ready for a fight. A fight that had to be coming. They knew who they were after all. It was all out in the open at this point... so where would the strike come from?

There's a sudden flutter of orange behind Neysihen's head as she looks over to check something Purisha had spotted and Jerry surges forward in the literal blink of an eye, his short rifle dropping to hang on its sling even as he’s yanking Neysihen out of the line of a laser shot by her collar.

The slow motion tableau seems to crawl, everything hanging in the air as he brings his field pistol up and donates a high velocity 7.5 FK round directly to the terrorist's center of mass. The first round isn't enough to drop the ant-like Drin, but a second round center of mass and a third axiom charged round to the head finishes the job, a slight modification of the classic 'Mozambique' or 'Failure to Stop' drill that Jerry had practiced more often than he'd worked on his handwriting in school as a boy.

Two to the chest, one to the head. Or as the younger Marines had liked to joke, two to the chest, face gets the rest.

Still, the first laser shot touches off a fast ambush, with terrorists melting out of well concealed positions with a variety of weapons. Mostly galactic but Jerry hears the familiar sound of a Kalashnakov rifle firing in his general direction as a round goes whipping past his head to bury itself in the ground.

""Contact! All sides! Assault through!""

When surrounded on mostly all sides, the best option was to fall back or push through. Falling back wasn't an option, the objective was in front of them, so they surge forward, with Makula roaring a battle cry as she hand loads a slug into her massive shotgun and erases one of the AK gunners' torso.

""Hah! I’m really starting to see why the girls call these things shotfuns! This is great!""

""Move faster, enjoy later!""

Snaps Dar'Vok, even as she tracks with her GM-6 Lynx sniper rifle and donates a massive .50 BMG round with similar effects on target. Her tail was thrashing and her eyes were burning. Dar'Vok was... irritated if Jerry could tell anything from the axiom. Another .50 BMG round hammers home, followed by a third as Dar'Vok displays a talent for shooting accurately on the move.

Apparently someone had been practicing quite a bit since she had earned her cloak.

Neysihen and Purisha are back in the zone, communicating silently as they work together to bring down targets in every direction at once. They'd selected MP-7 submachine guns to supplement their pistols and MDRX rifles and were using the Earth spec ops favorite with aplomb, donating three round bursts to targets as they duck and weave in and out of cover.

One particularly large target receives three rounds from Purisha, then another three from Neysihen in the literal blink of the eye... and as far as Jerry can see as they rush past their shots would have all landed in the x ring if they'd been shooting at a paper target.

Even as his pistol gets stuffed into its holster and he retrieves his rifle and begins to engage on his own with its powerful .300 BLK ammunition, he feels a very warm sense of paternal pride as he watches Dar'Vok, Neyishen and Purisha work. They were daughters... of a sort, and he and his people had raised some exceptionally lethal young women in these three. He'd sensed the raw potential in all three of them, and was now seeing the fruits of that intuition and faith in their capabilities play out in front of them.

""You know, I thought traveling literally a billion light years from Earth would mean I wouldn't be getting shot at by religious fanatics or political extremists with AK-47s any more!"" Jerry gripes, even as he donates a volley of controlled shots to a pair of cultists who were working a crew served laser repeater.

""Sir, wasn't it you who told me that the most common elements in the galaxy were hydrogen, stupidity and AK-47 pattern rifles?"" Asks Purisha, an impish grin on her face.

""No turning my own words against me, Lance Corporal. You can start that when you make Gunnery Sergeant! Check right!""

Purisha's already on it though even as Jerry sees the sudden motion of another orange clad bad girl stepping out of alcove and lobbing a grenade. She drinks in axiom smoothly, accelerating almost faster than her MP-7 can cycle as she shoots first the grenade right out of the air, and then the surprised grenadier.

""Hah! Holy shit! Did you guys see that!?""

Purisha, pleased with herself, doesn't break stride for a second still advancing, still tight on her gun.

""We saw it, hope you recorded that with your optical implants."" Neysihen says.

""Oh I got it. I want that shot to play on my headstone! Or at least go in the extras of the next Bridger family combat footage release.""

Jerry looks around as they hit a solid spot with good cover and catches his breath, scanning quickly to get a good read on the terrain. As he looks in the distance he spots a few splashes of bright red laser fire further away than he'd expected... behind cover. Almost like there'd been a light fight over there.

""Nadiri... you good?""

The shadowy alien steps out of darkness, a rare example of Nadiri fully revealing herself.

""Oh I'm fine, while you all have been having fun driving straight up the middle I've been picking off ambushers and the like on our flanks. We should have a fairly clear shot to the transit hub. The security forces have a strong fortified position there, and I think there's a few Undaunted Marines with them.""

""Well then let's get over to our friends on the double ladies, we can't get bogged down playing with the appetizers. We might not have enough ammunition to share with the main course.""

Makula chuckles, a low throaty sound. ""That'd be too bad. Guess we'd just have to beat'em to death with our bare hands... ooh. Could be a fun way to get a snack.""

The big toothy Cannidor smile on Makula's face gets a laugh from the rest of the team, confusing Makula a second.

""What? I'm a bit peckish. Fighting always makes me hungry.""

Jerry smacks the young woman on the pauldron. ""Well let's get this job done so we can see about scrounging something to eat. Come on, we can rest when we're taking the transit hub over to the Second Pillar!""

**Story:**

Everything starts interestingly enough, a post-apocalyptic world, with an army of birds that goes for domination of whatever has been left of the world, brutally oppressing everyone who stands on their way. You live in a small commune of tribal (canine) bikers and when the birds brutally kill your daughter’s best friend, it’s time to take arms again and bring death to all responsible.

The story is serviceable and at some points I felt engaged enough, but it lacks focus. The ending is disappointing, but that’s not my main gripe with it. It is a very specific trait of your character, a curse which allows you to be immortal which is the main driver of the story and… it is unbelievably dumb. I rolled with it and while I can’t say I was disappointed exactly, it did feel rather weak and wasn't helped by the other parts of the game. **3/5**



**Atmosphere:**

Post-apocalyptic hellhole. You’ve seen it in the past, you have an idea of what to expect. This is easily one of the weakest parts of the game, because the parts don’t make a proper whole.

In short, it’s a lack of contrast: everything is grimdark to the extent that it becomes grimderp. There is almost no variation of how bleak the world is, the lack of any hope, the (mostly) futility of your actions, even with the music, which ends up being a bit too much.

Characters are in their majority unredeemable pricks, annoying and unrelatable, including your player character. I know “this is hard times”, but there have been examples on how to make a story’s atmosphere better and this falls flat. The **only** saving grace in regards to atmosphere is the graphics, which are very well made and portray the world well enough. **2/5**



**Graphics:**

I can think of few games that do graphics better, but that wouldn't be fair to the beautifully desolate hand-made pieces of art. The game gets an extra point of how they manage to convey the world. **5/5**



**Sound:**

Sound effects are basic, nothing more to add to that. I would rate this lower, but the music is quite well made, even though it becomes “too much” (the lack of contrast I mentioned), making the whole “desolation” feeling feel more forced. **4/5**



**Gameplay, general:**

This is a very unusual metroidvania, in that for the most part you control a bike. If you remember those Flash games where you had to go over obstacles balancing your bike, it’s that, but with guns. It’s a bit daunting at first, but you get used to it relatively quickly.

I was disappointed by most guns, finding myself using the pistol for the most part (and the shotgun only when it was needed). There are a slight auto-aiming and a landing-on-your-head-lenience options which reduced my frustrations with repeatability of certain sections which made exploration easier.

Combat is a bit annoying in the beginning, but you get used to shoot first and ask questions later, saving your bacon many many times. There is however a VERY negative aspect about combat, in that when the camera zooms out by a lot or when you are covered by gore (which happens very often), you have no idea if you are going to land on your head or not. I alleviated this mid-way after losing to a boss one too many times, by enabling the grace period option.

Side-quests are for the most part useless since you get a few resources which you can easily gather yourself. I was expecting a bit more character development through these side quests (or at least, more substantial bonuses), but you can easily skip most of them. **3/5**



**Gameplay, exploration:**

I’m rating this low, because exploration is frustrating. There is a good number of checkpoints, but fast-travel points are few and far in between and every time you die or change levels, all enemies respawn. As you progress through the story, enemies become more and more frequent at specific points making traversal annoying, with no real sense of accomplishment when you get through, just a chore to get to where you are trying to go.

More frustratingly, some of these side-quests are essentially fetch quests and you have no idea what or where exactly is what you are looking for. I had to use a guide for some of them, because it’s so very easy to dismiss something as background graphics.

Still, there are a few points where you get rewarded with components to meaningful upgrades, but you wouldn’t know where to look if you didn’t decide to just bike around. Which I don’t mind doing, if only the traversal wasn’t so annoying. **2/5**



**Gameplay, platforming:**

Platforming in the game is decent although different than in most metroidvanias. All levels are designed for you to roll around with your bike, but certain leaps and manoeuvres can be difficult to pull off, especially with enemies around, leading to your death and having to go through a bunch of baddies again. The camera is also often acting against you by not zooming in and out appropriately, which can easily lead to you getting shot or… well, landing on your head. **3/5**



**Closing comments & overall:**

**2 out of 5**. I went into this game a bit apprehensive, due to the biking mechanic, but thankfully that wasn’t my biggest gripe with it. As I started kinda liking it, I also started to notice all the itsy bitsy things that bothered me. I found the story weak, the atmosphere pathetically *narm*, the characters unrelatable and the gameplay merely a bit better than average.

At about 20 bucks, this is more expensive than I’d have liked. I felt a lot of dissonance in the game’s elements and I after I finished it, I can’t say that I enjoyed as I would have liked.

Often, I felt punished for exploring too much too early. For example, I would come across a boss door, find nothing there, assume I finished exploring it and move on. Later, talking to an NPC makes the boss doors active and enterable - but since I already explored that section and found nothing, didn't realize I needed to go back. I feel the game should have been framed so that you meet that quest NPC first or at least make the boss door more noticeable - the important things blended in too much with the background like you pointed out.

Fanfic: The Phantom Thieves in Jabba's Palace (Part III),"Jabba's Palace was massive, spacious, and labyrinthian. A lesser being could easily get lost in the myriad of criss-crossing tunnels that composed the deep, dark depths of his fortress, not unlike the Metaverse itself. As such, it took the pair of guards quite a while to drag up the squirming form of Haru Okumura. In that time, an iron cage had been hoisted over Jabba's dais, providing its new occupant, Futaba Sakura, a 'glorious' view of her new home. Futaba was kept totally naked, her nimble fingers clutching the bars of her prison, her terrified face looking between them. The only piece of clothing she was allowed were her glasses, which Jabba found alluring.   


As such, Futaba had a bird's eyes view of the mob scene when Haru was dragged in, still wrapping in the arms of the burly Gamorrean guard. Futaba pressed her cheeks against the bars, her heart going out to her friend. ""Haru!"" She called, as loud as she could to be heard over the squealing, lecherous crowd of aliens. ""Haru, are you alright?!""  


Haru, wrapped firmly in the Gamorrean's arms, didn't hear Futaba at first. She cringed in terror as the crowd of aliens looming around her, the guards walking through the horde of alien creatures. Monsters of all shapes and sizes, each more hideous than the last, taunting him, a few bolding ones even lunging out to grab at her, only to be swatted or threatened back by the Gamorreans. Haru wilted in terror, shaking in the arms of her captor. Her heard perked up as they reached the edge of the dance floor, following Futaba's cries until she found her friend suspended in her cage above.  


""Futaba!"" Haru blushed deeply at the sight of her friend utterly naked. What had they done to her?! ""Are YOU alright?!""  


Futaba wilted in her cage and wrapped her arms around her petite breasts, covering herself as best she could. ""N-no. I'm not...b-but I'm glad to see you're okay...where are Ann and Makoto-""  


""SILENCE!"" Jabba boomed, his baritone voice as usual quieting the ruckus of his throne room. Futaba scampered away from the bars with a terrified 'eep!', crawling to the middle of her suspended prison, making it rock back and forth slightly from her movement. Haru looked to Jabba himself and her eyes widened behind her mask, gasping at the sight of the hideous slug lounging on his throne. She was forced forward to the edge of his dais. Her arms were forced behind her back, gripping tightly in the greedy finger fingers of the pig-man, the oafish brute taking a moment to sniff her curly hair. The lecherous horde of monsters employed by the revolting, vile Hutt gathered around eagerly. They were in for a treat today, one new pet to the master was not uncommon but TWO? Now this would be a show to see!  


""Who...what are you?"" Haru stumbled, staring at Jabba the Hutt with horrified fascination. ""Are you...a Shadow?"" She looked around, searching for any signs this was a Palace but although it had a horrid design comparable to those, this place seemed all too natural to be a manifestation of a person's dark dreams.   


Jabba chuckled deeply, deliberately not answering Haru for a few, agonizing moments. He took a moment to admire her, enjoying her cute features and the way her buxom breasts clearly strained her conservative costume. He drooled lecherously, already fantasizing about what lay beneath. Futaba watched in terrified silence from her cage, peering out over the sight, only the whites of her eyes visible behind her big round glasses as she kept the rest of her naked body out of sight.  


Jabba then wave a hand at his guards. They knew what his gesture meant. One guard drew a vibro knife. Haru screamed in terror and swung a powerful roundhouse kick at the guard. It caught him in the groin but the Gamorrean just gave a grunt of annoyance, not even seeming to feel the blow. He strode over the squirming girl, Haru shrieking out ""No...no...PLEASE-"" as she saw the knife coming closer. Futaba covered her mouth in horror, were these monsters going to KILL her?  


But this was not the case. The guard sliced open Haru's top instead. Her large, creamy tits bounced free, Haru instantly going silent, her cheeks turning an ashamed shade of pink to match her clothes. The guards stepped aside, Jabba drooling deeply over the sight of Haru's buxom breasts. Haru shuddered as she saw the unmistakable look of lust, visible even on Jabba's only semi-human facial features, glaring at her with rank intent. There was no mistaking it, this creature DESIRED her. The thought revolted her immediately and the disgust was immediately apparent on her face, which enticed Jabba even further. His mighty tail wiggled in deep desire among the cushions on his throne as Jabba bellowed, waving his corpulent, fat arms at himself, ""Bring her here.""  


The exact words of what he said weren't grasped by the girls but the intent behind them was as he waved at himself. Haru did not want to get close to that creature and tried to stomp on the guard's feet, dig in her heels, anything. She even tried headbutting the Gamorrean's snout. But all her efforts were fruitless and she was trashed, kicking and thrashing, to Jabba's dais. Futaba shook the bars of her cage, rattling them as she bravely cried out: ""Leave her alone!"" Her yells were ignored, a mere annoyance as scoundrels of all shapes and sizes jeered at Haru as she was forced to her knees before Jabba.  


Haru stared up at the huge, slimy, bloated Hutt with wide, fearful eyes. Jabba leered down at her, the power he held over this intruder and her friend swelling him with arousal. His slimy tail crawled forward, its girthy form shoving itself right in Haru's face. It wiggled, slapping against the side of her soft cheek, making Haru let out a cry of disgust. She twisted her head sideways to avoid its repugnant touch, as the thing pulsated inches from her lovely lips.  


Jabba switched to Basic, finally addressing the girl in her own language. ""Suck it,"" Jabba demanded, his booming voice sending shivers down Haru's spine. She gasped in horror, eyes flicking to the wiggling tail. It didn't just LOOK phallic, it was a sex organ. ""Now!""  


""N-never!"" Haru growled, baring her teeth with ample defiance. She spat on the tip of Jabba's tail, making her absolute contempt for the Hutt and his perverted order clear. ""I will never do th-""  


""Fine,"" Jabba interrupted smugly, his booming voice drowning out Haru's fiesty protests. He waved one hand and the sound of blasters echoed through the warm, a squad of Weequay aiming their blaster rifles up at Futaba's helpless, dangling form. Futaba looked out of the cage in terror, head flicking from side to side. She gripped the bars, gasping as she saw the guns aimed at her. ""Then I shall find my entertainment another way. Guards! On my mark!""  


""WAIT!"" Haru squealed, straining against the arms of her captor. Her squirming caused her buxom breasts to knock together, drawing Jabba's attention back to his prey. He smirked, at least as best a Hutt could, and waved his hand for his men to lower their blasters. ""I'll...I'll do as you say. Just don't hurt her.""  


""Haru, no!"" Futaba cried out, not wanting her friend to suffer for her sake. But Haru ignored her and forced herself forward, lips right next to the edge of Jabba's phallic tail. She reluctantly opened her lips, ready to give attention to Jabba's appendage. Haru had never done anything like this before, her conservative, sheltered background would have never allowed it. She tried to apply what she had learned through discussion with the other girls in private but before she had the chance, the vile tail shot forward. Jabba reminded her who was in control as his tail penetrated her mouth, stuffing the poor girl's lips with his vile appendage.   


A startled ""MMPH!"" escaped Haru's mouth as Jabba's tail thrusted inside. The court howled with laughter, Haru's cheeks swelling to just contain the wiggling thing. She coughed and sputtered, Futaba groaning with horror. She couldn't bare to watch and covered her eyes, averting it from the horror below. Jabba began to thrust down Haru's throat, filling her mouth with the sheer length and size of his gross tail. It felt rubbery and slimy, noxious substances leaking down Haru's throat. She was forced to breath through her nose, gurgling and wretching as the tail pulsated down her throat. The wet slaps of the tail's length smashing against her mouth echoed through the throne room, Haru's head rocking from the sheer greed and violence of Jabba's debased act. The only coherent thought was that she had to bear it and resisted, against all her natural instincts, to bite down on his throbbing length.  


At last, Jabba's tail mercifully slithered free of her mouth. The poor girl wrenched and gagged, coughing for air, spitting up flaks of slime. Jabba groaned deeply, Haru's mouth not being especially skilled but the act of ravaging it had felt very good indeed. He waved at the guards and boomed to them,  


""This little one will do nicely for my throne...take her to the harem to be PREPARED. Ho ho ho!""  


Haru shrieked as she was yanked up and much like Futaba before her, carried away. She stretched her arm out to Futaba, making a feeble effort to reached for her cage friend despite the impossible space between them. ""Futaba!"" Haru wailed before she disappeared into the shadows, forcing away to parts unknown for now.  


""You monster, you bastard!"" Futaba spat down at Jabba, gathering up her courage. ""How dare you do that to her!!!!""  


Jabba just laughed and reached into his bowl, snagging another paddy frog. ""Flattery,"" He boomed as he threw the squealing animal down his gullet. ""Will get you NOWHERE my dear...ho ho ho!""",1b0kyrd,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/slaveleiaandjabba/comments/1b0kyrd/fanfic_the_phantom_thieves_in_jabbas_palace_part/,[]
I'm writing a whole saga about my character's life (part 1),"The Rise of Farquar (Ages 1-18)

Born into royalty, Farquar Pineada was a child of immense privilege in a nation crippled by poverty. Poverty which resulted, at times, in children starving in the streets. The elderly, perishing in their beds, alone. And worse. Crime was consistently rampant, the death toll particularly heavy in those areas members of the elite were either all but unaware of or all too eager to forget about. Farquar was no exception. 

An unruly, troublesome child, Farquar Pineada saw his royal status as an indicator of his worth as a human being. An authority, far above that of his lessers. Farquar was a menace from the very beginning. 

A habitual bully, Farquar would target other students and teachers alike. He would pick out the classmates whom he deemed the weakest, and then, he'd attack. The mean-spirited pranks and outright insults were a near daily occurrence. Most people around him despised Farquar, but whether through fear or a desire to get on his ever-temperamental ‘good side’, nobody ever stood up to him. 

That was, until one quiet, particularly shy student who was always told so adamantly by his parents to report people like Farquar no matter what, the school faculty couldn't as easily ignore the bully's horrid actions anymore. Despite the principal's involvement and Farquar's overt smugness in the torment of his latest victim, even going so far as to openly dare the man to do something about it, there wasn't much the principal could do. Placing Farquar on suspension or inflicting any sort of detention-based punishment might interfere with his studies. A result the ruling monarchs would certainly take issue with. So, the anxious man did all he thought he could to try and resolve the issue, for the school’s sake, and curb young Farquar's worrying delinquent behaviour. With a trembling hand, he began to tap the keys, dialing the number listed on the boy's contact details. It was the number of the Queen herself. 

Farquar was incensed. As soon as his father had finished roaring at him and he was done uttering his insincere apologies, he had stormed back to the quiet safety of his palatial bedroom as he sat there, back against the door. Seething. He desperately wanted revenge on the peasant who had the gall to get him into trouble with his parents, and he began to put a plan into place to snuff out the rat for good. He would never let anybody tell him what to do like that again. Ever. By the time he was done, he would make sure the whole world knew it, too. 

By age fifteen, Farquar was a hardened troublemaker. King of the jocks despite his lacking athleticism, he felt utterly invincible. After trying and failing to talk his gang of yes men into helping him go through with the crime all the way, Farquar decided that he would have to take things into his own hands. After one last perfect sunny day on the town with his girlfriend as they did the usual anarchistic rounds of pulling fire alarms, smashing out windows, and hitting passing cars with rocks, Farquar looked her in the eyes and said goodbye to her for what he knew very well might be the last time. He had known her since he was seven, and it almost felt genuine when he muttered ‘I love you’ as he walked away from her.

The next day, at school, Farquar was ready. He was prepared to take a life, and the feeling thrilled him. In the crowded cafeteria, the jocks surrounded the boy who’d snitched before grabbing him under the legs and beneath the arms as he screamed out for help. The whole place erupted with the collective ridiculing laughter of close to a hundred teenagers as the boy was dunked head-first into a full garbage can overflowing with rotting food and used napkins. He shrieked out in humiliation and rage when the can fell over along with him as it hit the floor producing an almighty clatter as the jocks began to back off, joining in with laughter of their own before finally leaving him be.

The boy returned to his place at the table alone as he tried to stifle his tears, many students still snickering at him audibly. He picked up the cup from in front of him as he buried his head in shame, drinking deeply to soothe his frayed nerves. He barely had time to register the change in taste before his stomach began to ache.

From across the cafeteria, Farquar watched intently as the teachers ran over to the thing crumpled up on the floor. After several long, agonising minutes, the groans finally stopped. The boy was dead. Farquar was a killer. With a satisfied smirk he left out the door behind him and walked down the hallway, content to skip the rest of the school day to wait and see what just might happen. Nothing, he presumed. Afterall, he was royalty. A god among sheep.

By the end of the year, the killer was serving life. Held in a juvenile detention center until he was old enough to be transferred to a maximum security facility. Despite his confinement, his bloated sense of superiority never faltered as Farquar openly proclaimed it to any and all who would listen. Despite their contempt for the prince, just like before none dared call him out on the incessant irritating comments he’d make regarding his grandeur. Before long, he already had an assault and an escape attempt under his belt.

For a very brief time at age seventeen, Farquar managed to slip away past the guards as he hit the streets once again. Immediately he returned home to the castle where he expected his parents to arrange safe travel for him out of the country until such a time as he was to ascend the throne, however with a look of fear in his mother’s eyes the teen was enraged as he turned to see the guards heading their way. Dispassionately they seized Farquar as he flailed under the grip of the men dragging him off as he promised with a menacing glare that this would not be the last time he and the monarch would meet, and that when they did, the nation would belong to him and him alone. Back in his cell, Farquar sat, meditating on his plans. Plans of which were already beginning to play out… Plans that would see all who betrayed him dead and gone and forgotten, replaced by leadership that would be strong and that would ensure the prosperity of the kingdom he was soon to control for himself.


(Ages 19-20)
The guard took the thick envelope from Farquar’s outstretched hand, surreptitiously flicking through the stack of bills inside before offering a small nod in response as he turned and walked back down the wing. Farquar grinned. He was untouchable. Prison life had been a breeze for the now eighteen-year-old royal. Despite his parents’ reluctance to answer the letters he’d send they still granted him access to their immense wealth which Farquar had used to ensure his power over the prison. Supermax was hardly free, and it made juvie look like a daycare center in comparison. But for what it was worth, his fortune all but gave him run of the place. A failed appeal had left a sour taste in Farquar’s mouth, and the guard’s refusal to even entertain the idea of allowing him access to conjugal visits made him furious. One guard even laughed, remarking how ‘He’d be waiting a long time for that’. This was a slight that could not be ignored.

Distributing small denominations of bills to a select violent few, Farquar incited a riot that would see nearly fifty people injured. Some quite seriously. After the carnage had died down and the dust had settled the following day, Farquar utilised his wealth once again as well as his notoriety as a scrupulous killer in acquiring the protection of organised crime within the prison walls. He feared the guards might not honor their arrangement following the multiple injuries sustained by the staff. But, more than that, he didn’t care much for their help, anyway. With all that wealth at his disposal, he could get whatever he wanted from the right people.

Four years into his sentence, Farquar felt renewed. The growing sadness he’d felt might consume him entirely had lifted. It was almost time. He wrote a letter to his girlfriend, Nayla, who had remained faithful despite the time that had passed. She was all he had left, and she knew that. She felt like she would be abandoning him if she left. By the time she received that letter, she’d know what was about to happen. After a brief meditation in the darkness of his cramped cell, Farquar sprang into action. In the chaos of another riot in the yard, Farquar dressed himself quickly in the guard uniform smuggled to him earlier that day before making his way casually along the drab concrete hallway towards the front door. As he passed by a guard in a chair peering over his sunglasses at a newspaper, Farquar became very conscious of the gun on his belt weighing him down as he moved. He wondered if he would be able to reach for it before the guard could go for his own, but he didn’t look up. Farquar was free at last.

Nayla took the money from Farquar as he pressed it into her chest and she let him inside. She hardly recognised him with his new look, not to mention how the years inside had already aged him beyond his youth. She told him that she loved him as she wept, and the two embraced. That night, a child was conceived. 

Prowling the streets, Farquar spotted a car with the window halfway down. He took the opportunity, and within minutes he had sped off into the night as the radio blared to his delight, the risk having paid off. One wrong move, and he’d be in a cage again. He knew he might not get another chance. Neon lights shone in the distance before him, girl’s laughing, bodies shifting in a darkened line. The sight of it made his paranoia melt away. The lack of news reports about his escape reassured Farquar. Likely the powers that be wanted their own covert recovery carried out so as to spare the prison authorities any undue embarrassment. It was a decision which would signal their immediate downfall.
Meeting with the short, fat-looking little man in the alleyway, Farquar eyed him suspiciously. This was the assassin who was to eliminate his father? They send a pauper to kill a prince? He considered remarking as much, but then as he got closer he decided to hold his tongue. The man glared at Farquar before slowly reaching out his thick, callused hand. The look in his eyes, enough to murder as well as any weapon of war. Farquar smiled warmly as he handed over the cash. The man didn’t reciprocate the gesture.

Later, as Farquar lounged on his girlfriend’s couch flicking through channels, he finally saw what he had been hoping for so intensely. Prince Deveraja, second in line to the throne of the kingdom of Malaysia, had been murdered. The hunt was on for the man responsible, but Farquar knew they would likely never find him. He wanted to imagine the killer on a beach somewhere, but he was more certain he would be haunting some cold corner in obscurity for quite a long time to come.

In the mail, the queen received a letter which made her heart sink as the tears began to well in her eyes. It was a dead daisy, nothing more. Exactly what her murderous son had given to his first victim before he took his life from him. From a payphone, Farquar asked her if she liked her gift. The queen called him for everything she thought he was; a killer, a monster, a traitor to his homeland. Farquar simply laughed before he went on to accuse no one but her of treachery, and how that would all be put to an end soon enough. The monster prince slammed the phone back into the receiver before heading back out into the cool evening air. In the royal castle, her majesty wept alone in her bed where she used to lay with her husband, the love of her life, who had now been ripped away from her.

Farquar groaned as he released himself, bucking, he finished before climbing off from atop Nayla, who was far from done herself. Although she said nothing about it. She asked him what he was going to do now. She said how she didn’t want to lose him again. Farquar got dressed in dark clothing, kissed his girlfriend goodbye and walked out the front door, the gun in his waistband cold against his clammy skin.

The shot rang out across the castle courtyard as the queen crumpled to the stones beneath her. Her meditation was cut short by the bullet. Her life, extinguished. Her legs remained crossed as she slumped, blood seeping from the head wound in a sputtering stream. Farquar pulled away, tossing the gun over a roadside cliff through the driver’s side window. Later, he had the car scrapped. He had done it. He had succeeded his parents and become the rightful king of Malaysia. Within days, he was recognised officially as just that. His criminal status rendered inert by a technicality no lawmaker could have ever before perceived of. Parties were thrown of the most exorbitant sort, attended by floods of guests of the highest esteem. A million dollar ring purchased for the soon-to-be Queen Nayla would adorn her finger like God Himself and the resulting wedding was the biggest the impoverished nation had ever seen. For a short, very uncertain time, a peace was maintained as Farquar worked to reassure the people of his kindness as a ruler. One who would serve them well. It wasn’t, however a period entirely free of killing, though. An example still had to be set, after all. Farquar had his royal guard send for an old face. His friend, Rayzal. A man Farquar had known since infancy. Then, he had him hanged in the public square. Anybody was liable to face a similar fate should they try to question his authority. Everybody was at risk when they presented themselves as the enemy.",1b0ked9,185,31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1b0ked9,"['It sucks when you put a ton of effort in and the first comment you get is: I’m not reading that.

"Wonder, Magic, and Horror","My mother believed in the supernatural. 

&#x200B;

She believed that there was so much more to this world than meets the eye… so much that we don’t understand. When I was a kid, she used to tell me about it. She raised me on stories of monsters, magic, and fae. Stories of things she’d seen, full of wonder and magic and horror. I was fascinated by them, and I’d believed them, even though I never saw any of it for myself. She always told me that I would someday, and I always believed her.

&#x200B;

I used to fantasize about being just like her, of researching the supernatural and peeling back the veil, right by her side. But… fate had other plans, I guess. 

&#x200B;

When the cancer hit, I originally tried to stay hopeful. I wanted to believe that she’d pull through. Sure, this was a raw deal but… I told myself that everything was going to be okay! Mom was doing fine! She was going to pull through! Things were going to turn around! But they didn’t.

&#x200B;

To her credit… she kept on smiling until the end. But that didn’t make it any easier to watch her die. And when she was gone, my world felt… well… darker. Growing up, everything had always felt so magical, but once she was gone, so was the magic.

&#x200B;

I was in school at the time, majoring in Evolutionary Biology at Upper Lake University in Tevam Sound… Mom had said that if I wanted to follow my dream of working side by side with her, *that* was the best place to study. She’d even taught there herself, once upon a time. But without that dream on the horizon, continuing on with my studies just felt… well… pointless. I went through the motions, sure. But I didn’t care the way I used to. Mom’s stories suddenly felt so much more hollow. The world didn’t feel magical, it felt mundane, and I started to wonder if the stories she’d once told me were ever true in the first place, or if they’d been just that. Stories.

&#x200B;

I tried to find solace in a few different places… girls, pot, parties, shots of dopamine to keep my mind off of my grief. But none of those really did much to help. At best, they were just a distraction, and at worst, they just made me hurt more. Still, it was all I had so… I kept on going, hoping that something might eventually change. 

&#x200B;

And funnily enough, it did.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I woke up with a mild hangover from a party I’d been at the night before. Sunlight streamed in through my curtains, coaxing me awake, although the girl beside me, Autumn remained fast asleep. 

&#x200B;

Autumn was admittedly just a fling. We’d hooked up a few times, but it wasn’t anything serious. She wasn’t the type of girl I usually went for… I've usually got a soft spot for girls who are a little rougher around the edges. But we both needed a rebound, and she was cute, with an adorable little button nose, kissable cheeks, and a smile that was hard to resist. I didn’t know how long we were going to keep doing this, but she was good company for the time being, especially after the dumpster fire that was my last relationship.

&#x200B;

Her leg brushed against mine. I rolled onto my side, looking over at her. She was still asleep. Her hair was a mess and I could see the hickeys trailing down her neck. I couldn’t help but admire them with quiet satisfaction, before sitting up slowly and stretching. My bedroom was, admittedly, kinda a mess. My bedside table was covered in all sorts of clutter. Books, empty bottles of gatorade, a glass pipe, deodorant. Then there were the clothes on the floor… more than just the ones from last night. I figured I should probably do something about that.

&#x200B;

I grabbed some comfy shorts and a tank top from the dresser before gathering my clothes off the floor and stuffing them in my hamper. I left Autumn’s clothes on the bed, before shuffling out of the bedroom and into the kitchen.

&#x200B;

My apartment wasn’t very big, but it was cozy and while I wasn’t going to be cooking any grand meals in that kitchen, I had enough space to make breakfast. I grabbed a clean pan and got to work. I had eggs, and I had bacon. Fantastic. 

&#x200B;

Autumn preferred her eggs over easy, so that’s how I made them. I put on a kettle for tea as well, while I blinked the sleep from my eyes and tried to get my bearings. It was Saturday, no class today, but I did have work in a few hours. 

&#x200B;

The eggs and bacon sizzled in the pan, filling my little one bedroom apartment with the most wonderful aroma while spitting hot oil at me. The white of the yolk was starting to look just about ready to flip, and the bacon was crisping to a perfect mahogany. 

&#x200B;

I flipped the eggs, then got out two mugs as the kettle boiled. Autumn liked Earl Gray tea. I preferred chai but didn't mind a compromise. In the next room, I could hear movement and wondered if the smell of breakfast had woken her up. 

&#x200B;

The eggs were done. So was the bacon, I killed the heat on the stove, before plating everything up. As I did, I couldn’t help but notice the flash of blue and red lights outside my window. 

&#x200B;

How long had that been there? That wasn’t new, was it?

&#x200B;

I paused to snoop. My apartment was on the third floor but had a good view of the street. I could see three police cars parked out front. What was that about? My mind immediately drifted to the pipe in my bedroom, although that stuff was legal these days. Even if it wasn't, I doubted the cops would show up just because I smoked a bowl last night. Something else was going on. Something more serious.

&#x200B;

I could hear movement out in the hall. Footsteps, voices. 

&#x200B;

Police.

&#x200B;

Were they on my floor?

&#x200B;

I paused, before deciding to take a peek out into the hall. I headed for the door and opened it just a crack. As soon as I did, I saw an officer walking past. He didn’t really pay any mind to me. He was heading for the door near the end of the hall. Wasn’t that Sarah Bond’s apartment? Was she in trouble? I admittedly didn’t know her very well. I knew she was a student at the University, just like I was (a lot of the people in this building were students, actually) and I knew that she ran with a shady crowd, but the few times we’d spoken to each other, she’d seemed alright to me. 

I could see a few other officers there waiting for him outside her door, although I couldn’t hear what they were talking about.

&#x200B;

I noticed another woman standing in the hall watching them, Anna James. Another student. Her golden blonde hair was fairly messy, indicating she’d probably just woken up too, although I don’t know what possessed her to think that stepping out of her apartment in a pair of cheetah print pajama bottoms was even remotely acceptable. Maybe I was being judgemental, but my ex cheated on me with her, so I think I was allowed to hate her guts a little. 

&#x200B;

Still - she was the only person in the hall aside from the cops, so I figured I might as well ask what was going on.

  “I don’t know,” Was her response. She adjusted her round glasses as she watched the police. “I guess someone heard screaming and called the cops?”

&#x200B;

  “Jesus, is she alright?”

  “I don’t know, I didn’t hear anything but…” Anna trailed off as the police quietly disappeared into Sarah’s apartment, leaving one officer out to make sure nobody got closer. Both of us stared uneasily at the door before deciding that we’d seen all there was to see.

&#x200B;

  “Guess we’ll find out one way or another…” Anna murmured before she quietly turned and headed back to her own apartment. After a few moments, I did the same. 

&#x200B;

I didn't know Sarah very well, but I couldn't help but be a little worried for her. Like I said, I knew she ran with a rough crowd. She and her friends were the kind of people you talked to if you wanted something a little harder than pot. But as far as I could tell, her rough crowd wasn’t really dangerous. Shady, yes. But not dangerous. Maybe this was about the drugs? Maybe she was getting busted or something? I honestly hoped that was just it. The idea of it being something else turned my stomach a little. I tried not to think about it as I went to check in on Autumn.

&#x200B;

She was awake, sitting up in my bed and checking her phone, draped in a blanket that conveniently didn’t cover much up.

  “Morning,” I said.

  “Morning.”

  “You hungry, I made breakfast.”

  “Mmm? Thank you.”

I brought in the plate for her and we sat on the bed together to eat. I didn’t tell her about what I saw out in the hall. I honestly just didn’t want to think about it.

&#x200B;

Everything was probably fine… Sarah probably had a bad trip or something, and the police had probably just come to check in on her and found her stash. Yeah… everything was probably fine.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

After Autumn left, I got ready for work. I’d been picking up shifts at a local cafe down the street just for some extra spending money. Mom’s estate covered my monthly rent, but I hated the idea of relying solely on that. I can’t say that the work was particularly exciting, but it was money.

&#x200B;

The cops had still been in Sarah’s apartment when I’d left. I tried not to think about that… although it still lingered in the back of my mind during my shift. And apparently, I wasn't the only one thinking about it.

&#x200B;

About halfway through my shift, a small group of girls had come in. I recognized one of them as another tenant in my building, although I didn’t know her name. I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop on anyone… but every now and then, I overheard snippets of people's conversations, especially when the cafe wasn’t all that busy, and when I heard them talking about what had happened to Sarah, I couldn’t help but listen in.

&#x200B;

  *“Yeah, my brother was at the scene… he said it was a mess.”*

  *“What happened?”*

  *“They don’t know! They just found the place trashed! Nobody saw anything, some of the neighbors just heard screams and some kind of struggle!”*

&#x200B;

A struggle? I felt a quiet unease in my stomach. Maybe something really had happened to Sarah?

&#x200B;

  *“Did they find anything?”* One of the girls asked.

  *“I heard they found some blood, but that was it.”*

  *“She was a druggie, right? I heard she was friends with Amber. Maybe that had something to do with it?”*

  *“Maybe? But it’s still weird that she just vanished like that! If she was dead, how would you even get the body out?”*

&#x200B;

My mind drifted back to some of my Mom’s old stories… specifically the ones about monsters, stalking people and spiriting them away. This couldn’t have anything to do with that, could it? Although now that the thought was in my head, it was hard to get it out… and now I couldn’t think of anything but the crime scene in Sarah’s apartment for the rest of my shift.

&#x200B;

When I finally left that evening, Sarah’s apartment was still on my mind. As I headed back to my own apartment, I couldn’t help but pause at my door and stare down the hall. The police were gone but had left tape up over her door. 

&#x200B;

My hand rested over my doorknob, but the pull to investigate was hard to resist. What harm would taking a quick peek do? I wasn’t going to touch anything… I was just going to look.

&#x200B;

Before I could stop myself, I was walking down the hall to Sarah’s door. I found it unlocked. I hesitated for a moment, before opening it, and gingerly ducking under the police tape. Sarah’s apartment was a mess… and unlike mine, it wasn’t a *lived in* mess. It looked like there’d been a brawl in there… furniture was overturned or broken, the television in the living room had been cracked… and then there was the blood. A smeared trail of it… leading down the hall.

&#x200B;

The sight of it made me freeze. It looked almost like somebody had been *dragged* down the hall, toward the bathroom at the end. I hesitated for a moment, before stepping over the blood and making my way over to the bathroom to investigate. My heart raced uneasily in my chest. I paused outside of the bathroom door before quietly pushing it open.

&#x200B;

The trail continued inside… only it moved up onto the counter and stopped at the mirror. I followed it with my eyes, before looking up at my reflection. The woman staring back at me looked like me… but seemed off somehow. Staring at it felt… wrong.

&#x200B;

I took a step back and left the bathroom. I’d seen enough.

&#x200B;

Mom’s old monster stories lingered in my mind… and it was hard to deny how similar this was to them. In those stories of hers, the cases were never solved. Or at least, not by the police. You can’t arrest a monster, after all.

You need someone else to deal with it.

Fortunately, I had someone in mind.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Mom always used to speak fondly about Dr. Caroline Vega. She’d met her during her time teaching at the University, and supposedly she was something of an expert on the occult. Mom had even consulted her as a source for her own research back in the day, and I figured that if anyone might be able to make sense of what I’d seen at Sarah’s apartment, it would be her. 

&#x200B;

I’d only met Dr. Vega a handful of times myself, and I wouldn’t exactly say I knew her well, but I’d been to her house with Mom so I knew where to find her.

&#x200B;

Dr. Vega’s house was in the nicer, more suburban side of Tevam Sound and even then it stood out from the houses around it thanks to its garden. It flourished around the house, making it look like something out of a fairy tale. Flowers of all colors blossomed in tiered terraces by the steps leading up to her front door and vibrant ivy crawled up her red brick walls. I knocked on the door, and after a moment it was answered by a man I didn’t recognize.

&#x200B;

  “Hi, I’m looking for Dr. Vega?” I asked.

He gave a nod.

  “Oh, yeah she’s out back. Are you here for the Summer Solstice feast?”

  “Um… no? I just wanted to pick her brain about something.”

&#x200B;

He nodded.

  “Yeah, I’ll go and get her. Come on in.”

He gestured for me to follow him into the house.

&#x200B;

Vega’s home was a hell of a lot more cluttered than the pristine garden out front might suggest, although I’m not sure if I’d call it messy. Books were abandoned on tables, and every surface either had a potted plant or a trinket on it. Sometimes there was even more than one. Still, this place had a sort of warm, welcoming atmosphere to it and there was a pleasant aroma of something delicious wafting through the air. This place felt homey… comfortable, even. The man led me through the cluttered halls, toward a small sunny parlor.

&#x200B;

  “I’ll let Caroline know she’s got a visitor!” He said, smiling at me before taking off. I watched him go, before quietly looking around.

The parlor had a similar atmosphere to the rest of the house although something about it felt different. It was almost like stepping into a chapel of some sort. I stood by the window, looking out at the garden behind the house. It was vibrant and breathtaking, almost putting the one out front to shame. Someone had clearly poured a lot of love into every hour of its cultivation, and I could see a small gathering of strangers around a table far in the back. Among them, I spotted Dr. Vega herself, smiling as she spoke to those around her.

&#x200B;

Then I heard a familiar voice behind me, speaking my name.

  “Justice?”

&#x200B;

I turned suddenly, to see a woman with shaggy, dirty blonde hair stepping out of a room behind me… a study, from the looks of it. She was dressed in a dark blue striped top, with a pale crystal necklace. I noticed that she was holding a crimson leather bound book, that she gingerly set down on the table beside her.

  “Temperance…” I said softly.

&#x200B;

I hadn’t actually seen her since we’d broken up… although she was looking better than she had been a few months back. 

  “What are you doing here?” She asked.

  “I… just had some questions for Dr. Vega,” I said. “What are you doing here?”

  “Summer Solstice feast,” She said, before realizing that wasn’t a great explanation. “Dr. Vega’s been helping me get back on the straight and narrow… I’m clean now, actually! One whole month now.” 

  “That’s good…” I said, still a little distracted. 

  “Yeah… feels good,” Temperance said. “You’re looking pretty good too!”

  “Thanks...""

  “You been seeing anyone lately?” 

&#x200B;

There was another underlying question there… one that I wasn’t sure how I wanted to answer.

  “Nothing serious” I admitted. 

  “Yeah… me neither. Did you want to maybe…”

  “No.”

&#x200B;

The answer came instantly.

  “No, I don’t think I…”

  “Yeah, that’s fair!” Temperance said, forcing a smile. “Look… I know I said I’m sorry but… it really was just a one time thing. I really am trying to turn it around!”

  “It wasn’t the cheating, Tempe…” I said softly. “I mean… that hurt, but we could’ve worked through that. It was everything else. There’s a clear line between getting a buzz and getting so fucked up you don’t even know who or where you are. You crossed it. You crossed it almost every fucking day, and I don’t think you realize how *scary* that was for me! Watching you go out with Amber and getting so high you couldn’t even stand, wondering how long it was going to take before you finally killed yourself. I kept waiting for the day I’d wake up, and find out that you’d OD’d beside me… I couldn’t do that. *I couldn’t*.”

&#x200B;

She nodded solemnly.

  “I get that,” She said softly. “But I’m getting better! Amber won’t be a problem anymore!”

I couldn’t help but narrow my eyes at that. The way she said it… like her junkie friends were the problem, and not her. That didn’t sit right with me.

&#x200B;

  “Well… I’m glad to hear that,” I said although the words felt insincere. “I’m happy for you.”

I heard movement in the hall and turned to see Dr. Vega stepping into the room with us. She carried two cups of tea with her.

  “Sorry to keep you waiting!” She said gently, before noticing Temperance. “Oh… am I interrupting?”

  “It’s fine… I was just on my way out!” Temperance said, before quietly leaving. Vega watched her go, before offering me one of the cups of tea.

&#x200B;

  “Well, well, Justice Young… it’s been a while since I’ve seen you!”

  “Sorry to just drop in,” I said. “It looks like you were in the middle of something.”

  “Oh, don’t you worry about it. Just a little get together. A few of my students have taken a certain interest in the Old Faith, and I guess I feel obligated to host some events so we can all get together.”

  “Sounds nice,” I said.

  “It’s lovely, you’re welcome to stay if you’d like!”

&#x200B;

If Temperance wasn’t there… I might’ve been tempted to say yes.

  “I appreciate it, but I really can’t stay.”

  “That’s fine! Why don’t we get down to business, then? What brings you to me?”

&#x200B;

Vega sat down in one of the plush loveseats across from the window, and I chose to sit down across from her.

  “There was an incident at my apartment the other day,” I said. “A girl disappeared. I know it’s technically none of my business, but I overheard some people talking about what happened and… well, it sounded kinda like the things Mom used to research.”

  “So you’ve been looking into it yourself?” Vega asked.

&#x200B;

I gave a hesitant nod. 

  “I took a look at the crime scene,” I admitted. “Something’s off, there… there was a trail of blood leading to the mirror. Almost like the girl… Sarah… was dragged there.”

Vega nodded.

  “I’ve seen the photos,” She said. “I have a friend with the local police who checks in with me every time he comes across something strange. He was just here this morning about the second attack.”

&#x200B;

  “There was a second victim?” I asked, my heart sinking a little.

  “Victims. Plural. It was just this morning. Similar M.O. Neighbors heard a struggle and screams… and police found a trail of blood, leading to the mirror. It’s troubling, to say the least.”

  “Do you have any idea what it might be?” I asked.

  “Yes and no. Odds are it’s some form of Grovewalker, but I can’t be certain about more than that.”

&#x200B;

Grovewalker… I’d heard the term before. Mom had always described them as twisted, otherworldly demons.

  “I told my friend that the best thing to do would be to figure out how the victims are connected. The way I see it, there’s two possible reasons why they’re being targeted. The first is that they somehow provoked something, in which case we’d need to find out how, and who else was involved.”

  “And the second?” I asked.

&#x200B;

  “The second is that someone is *using* the Grovewalker to hunt them down. Either way, there’s some sort of connection between the victims, and the only way to save any of them is to figure out what it is.”

  “Is there anything I can do to help you look?” I asked.

  “Honestly, it might be best to leave this to the proper people,” Vega said. “I’ve had a chat with one of your mother's former colleagues this morning, he’s sending someone out to look into all of this.”

&#x200B;

  “And how long is that going to take…?” I asked.

  “I’d expect he’ll be here by tomorrow.”

  “If there’s been two victims in two days, couldn’t someone else be dead by then?”

&#x200B;

Vega hesitated, before giving a half nod.

  “It’s very likely…” She said, “If I knew where to start looking, I’d probably be out there seeing if I could figure out the connection myself.”

  “Well maybe I can help?” I asked. “Who exactly was the second victim? Do you know?”

  “A girl and her boyfriend, Amber Cane and Martin Williams.”

&#x200B;

Those names sent a chill through me. I recognized them.

&#x200B;

Vega studied my expression for a moment, her eyes narrowing slightly.

  “You knew them?”

  “Not really… but she was friends with my ex. Temperance knew her.”

  “I see… one of her old friends?”

&#x200B;

I nodded.

  “Interesting. I’ll have to pick her brain about that. Do you know anyone else who was part of that group?”

  “There’s another friend of theirs in my building,” I said. “Anna. I don’t think she knew Sarah… the first victim all that well, but I know she was friends with Amber.”

  “Was she? It may be worth having a talk with her, then,” Vega said. 

  “I can reach out,” I said. 

&#x200B;

Vega nodded and took a sip of her tea, regarding me with a quiet uncertainty. 

  “It would be helpful,” She said. “You’ll likely have an easier time talking to her than I would. But you do understand that by getting involved, you’re taking on a considerable risk yourself, don’t you?”

&#x200B;

I nodded back at her.

  “Yeah,” I admitted. “But it’s what Mom would’ve done, isn’t it?”

She cracked a dry smile.

  “Yes… that or pouring over every book I have, trying to learn more on the subject. Speaking of which, if you’re going to talk to this Anna girl, the least I can do is handle the research. Hopefully we’ll at least know what we’re dealing with by the time your mothers old colleagues make it here.”

  “Sounds like a plan,” I said, before finally taking a sip of my tea. “I’ll check in with you as soon as I’ve talked to her.”

 “Please do. I’ll be in touch as well. If I find anything in my books, I’ll give you a call.”

&#x200B;

That settled it.

For a moment, I felt a rise of anxiety in my chest. It briefly occurred to me that I didn’t have much of an idea of what I was getting myself into… but I couldn’t just do nothing. Mom would’ve wanted to help. That was the kind of person she was, and that was the kind of person I wanted to be.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

It was mid afternoon by the time I made it home, although I didn’t bother going to my apartment. Instead I went and knocked on Anna’s door. 

&#x200B;

I’d been trying to figure out how to get into Amber’s death with her. Our relationship was pretty civil considering the fact that she’d fucked my ex, but we weren’t exactly friends. Showing up and asking about what had happened with Sarah and Amber might not go over well if I didn’t handle the approach right. Actually, truth be told, I wasn’t even sure if she knew about Amber yet and if that was the case, I wanted to at least try to break the news to her gently. By the time I knocked on her door, I’d planned out most of the conversation in my head and I figured that if I was lucky, it would all go according to plan.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately - I’ve never really been a lucky girl before. 

&#x200B;

When I knocked the first time, Anna didn’t answer.

&#x200B;

She didn’t answer after the second knock either.

&#x200B;

I caught myself wondering if maybe she wasn’t home… but I was pretty sure I’d seen her car out back. Maybe she’d gone out drinking instead? Or maybe she was just passed out on her couch, baked out of her gourd? There were a million completely logical reasons why she wasn’t answering!

&#x200B;

But considering what had happened to Amber and Sarah, I couldn’t help but wonder at a darker possibility. And the longer I stood in the hall, the more I contemplated that darker possibility. What if something had happened to her? What if she’d become the next victim? That thought lingered in my mind, unwilling to go away.

&#x200B;

I had to find out for sure… 

&#x200B;

I’ve had my share of misadventures while drunk, and gotten locked out of my apartment once or twice. I learned how to pick the lock, and it wasn't hard to pick the lock on Anna’s door. I figured that if I got caught, I could just lie and say I’d found it unlocked in the first place. The door clicked, and I pushed it open. The apartment was dead silent… but there was no obvious sign of a struggle. Everything seemed relatively normal. The TV was even on, playing old music videos on YouTube. 

&#x200B;

I noticed a hell of a setup spread out on her coffee table, and stepped closer to examine it. Empty cans of coolers were scattered around with spent syringes beside them. I didn’t know for sure what had been in the syringes, but if I had to guess, I’d say it was G. That had been Temperance's drug of choice. Clearly she’d been using recently. Maybe she was still home?

&#x200B;

I glanced down the hall, toward the bedroom, and made my way toward it. Her bedroom door was open, and I hesitated for a moment before peeking inside.

&#x200B;

What I saw there turned my blood to ice. 

&#x200B;

The sheets were stained with blood… enough of it that I knew Anna was dead. But there was no body to be found. Instead, there was simply a trail of blood leading to her bedroom vanity and ending at the mirror. Whatever had killed her must have taken her in her sleep… I could see her round glasses on her bedside table, spattered with dried blood. Maybe she was lucky enough not to wake up… maybe.

&#x200B;

My hands were shaking as I stumbled back out of the room, staring into it as my heart raced. My breath felt shaky and uneven. Whatever this thing was… it’d claimed its fourth victim, and judging by the color of the blood, Anna had been dead for a while. 

&#x200B;

It was killing more frequently.

&#x200B;

Vega *needed* to know about this…

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

  “So that’s four now…” Vega said gravely, as I broke the news to her. She sat in front of the window in her study, lit from behind by dying twilight. I noticed a few books on her desk, occult tomes detailing demons of every ilk.

  “Four that we know about,” I said. Vega’s expression soured.

  “You didn’t find anything at the scene?”

  “I didn’t really go poking around! That’s going to be an active crime scene! I don’t want the police knocking on my door!”

&#x200B;

  “Right… I’m sorry,"" she said. “I don’t suppose you know anyone else in that group?”

  “They were Temperance’s friends, not mine.” I said. “We could try asking her? Is she still here?”

  “I’ve already spoken to her about this. According to her, it’s been over a month since she’s been in touch with any of the victims. I’m not sure how much help she’ll be.”

  “Well I still want to ask her,” I said. “Is she still here?”

  “She left with the others earlier,” Dr. Vega said. 

&#x200B;

  “You just let her leave?”

  “She’ll be okay. I’ve been teaching her a thing or two while she’d been trying to get clean. Protective charms, and the like. Unless we’re dealing with a very high level entity it should be more than sufficient.”

I didn’t really like that answer, but she *was* the expert, so I wasn’t in much of a position to question it.

&#x200B;

  “In the meanwhile, I’ve been digging through a few old demonology tomes of mine,” She continued, getting up and picking up a crimson leather bound book. “I might’ve found something promising.”

  “You know what this thing is?” I asked hopefully, as I moved to look at the pages over her shoulder.

  “I think so. It’s a low tier Grovewalker, as I suspected. If we could draw it out, we might even be able to kill it.”

  “You can kill it?” I asked.

  “With the right curse, yes.” She said, “It wouldn’t take long to create a weapon that can harm it.”

&#x200B;

  “So then all we need to do is find it?” I asked. 

  “That’d be extremely risky.” She said, “These things are dangerous, Justice.”

  “It’s already killed four people and odds are it’s going to kill again,” I said. “If we can do something about that, we *should!* We have to!”

  “I agree, but we don’t know *why* it’s targeting these people. There’s any number of things that can draw a Grovewalker to a person. Chance encounters, mental or emotional state, or deliberate invocation. If we don’t know how to find it, there’s not much we can do about it.”

&#x200B;

I glanced down at the page, hoping that somehow the text on it might make more sense to me… it didn’t. Although my eyes were still drawn to something. The red leather cover of the book. I could just see the edge of it on the table, I frowned, before reaching out for it and partially closing it so I could read the front.

&#x200B;

*Liber Inferni.*

&#x200B;

  “What are you doing?” Vega asked.

  “Where did you get this?” I asked.

  “I don’t see how that’s relevant, but I have a friend who-”

  “No, I mean… today. When you picked this book up today, where did you find it? Was it in the parlor?”

  “Yes?”

  “But you don’t usually keep it there, do you?”

&#x200B;

She paused.

  “No, I try to keep most of my advanced books in here… operative word being try… I really should go through and-”

  “Temperance was reading this…” I said, and Vega trailed off. 

  “Excuse me?”

  “I saw her when we were talking in the parlor earlier, I saw her come out of your study and she was holding *this* book!”

  “You’re certain…?” She asked. “Justice if you’re saying what I think you’re saying, that’s a *serious* accusation.”

  “I know what I saw,” I said. “She was carrying *this* book! Why would she be reading this book? And then there’s what she said to me about Amber… she said she *‘wasn’t going to be a problem anymore.’*”

&#x200B;

I trailed off.

&#x200B;

No… no… I didn’t want to believe this. But the pieces fit together so well. Amber and her friends had been the ones who’d introduced Temperance to G. They’d been the ones she was buying it from… they were the ones she was usually getting high with. And the way she’d spoken about Amber when I’d run into her: “*Amber won’t be a problem anymore!”*

&#x200B;

That phrasing had bothered me. Now it terrified me.

&#x200B;

Vega was silent and slowly closed the book.

  “I need a minute to make some preparations,” She said. “After that… I think we need to have a chat with Temperance.”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Temperance’s apartment was a few streets away from mine.   
It was night when Vega and I arrived there. I stood behind her, watching as she pounded on Temperance’s door. I glanced at the long silver dagger in her hand, partially hidden up her sleeve. She’d been carrying it with her when she’d left her study after her *‘preparations.’*

*“The curse on this dagger should kill it,”* She’d said. I hoped that she was right.

&#x200B;

I could hear movement on the other side of the door before Temperance opened it.

  “Dr. Vega? What’s going o-”

&#x200B;

Vega cut her off by pushing through her door, her expression almost uncharacteristically cold. 

  “Four of your old friends are dead, Temperance… you wanna explain that to me?”

  “I didn’t…” She trailed off when she saw me, standing in the doorway and I could see the gears in her head slowly starting to turn.

  “You read the *Liber Inferni*, didn’t you? You used it. Tell me I’m wrong.”

&#x200B;

Temperance was silent.

  *“Tell me I’m wrong!”*

After a moment, she just cracked a sheepish smile.

  “I just… I was curious about some stuff,"" she said. “Come on, I only looked at it earlier today… didn’t Sarah and Amber die before that?”

&#x200B;

Vega wasn’t convinced. I pushed forward and slipped Temperance’s phone out of her pocket. She tried to stop me, but I was faster. I still remembered her lock screen password and opened up her camera roll. Sure enough… there were photographs in there of pages from the book Vega had been reading. Some of them from today, some from almost a week ago. I looked over at Vega, before showing her the photos. She studied them, before looking at Temperance with a silent horror.

  “What have you done…?” She asked, her voice trembling slightly.

  “It’s not like they didn’t have it coming!” Temperance finally said. “You both know what kind of people they were! You both know what they did to me!”

&#x200B;

  “Amber didn’t put a fucking gun to your head, Tempe! You *chose* to do that shit, over and over again you *chose* it!” I snapped.

  “And now I’m *choosing* to fix it!” Temperance said. “Justice… come on… I’m doing better! And no one’s going to miss them! It’s better this way! You can see that, right?”

&#x200B;

Vega and I just stared at her, as her expression slowly darkened.

  “You see it… right?” She repeated.

  “Whatever you’ve set up to control this thing, I’m taking it down…” Vega said softly, pushing past her to sweep the apartment. “Then we’ll figure out how to deal with you…”

  “No!” Temperance cried, grabbing her by the arm. “I’m not done with it yet, there’s still a few more! I need to finish it! *I need to finish it!”*

&#x200B;

Vega shrugged her off, pushing her aside.

*“I’M finishing it!”* She hissed, glaring into Temperance’s eyes.

&#x200B;

Temperance glared back at her, and I saw her hand go to her necklace.

  “Not until I’m done…” She said softly, *“NOT UNTIL I’M DONE!”*

In the next room, I could hear the thud of something moving. Something crashing to the ground. Vega and I both froze, as Temperance scrambled back.

  “I’m sorry Dr. Vega…” She said, her hand still on her necklace. “But I can’t let you get in the way!”

&#x200B;

The thing in the next room moved, and after a moment, I saw a shape stumble out of her bedroom and into the hall. Up until then… I’d never seen any of the things Mom had told me about in her stories. But now that I was looking right at one, all I could feel was a primal terror.

&#x200B;

I’m not entirely sure how to even describe it… it was simply a dark collection of limbs and flesh. I thought I could see faces among its undulating mass, and for a moment I could’ve sworn those faces resembled the dead. Amber, Sarah, Anna… others…

&#x200B;

I took a step back away from that *thing,* as Vega drew her knife, eyes fixated on it.

  “No!” Temperance said the moment she saw the knife. She must’ve known the threat it posed. “No, you *can’t!”* She lunged for Vega, slamming her into the wall and trying to wrestle the knife from her as the shape advanced. I could only stand rooted to the spot as she and Vega struggled for the knife. Temperance grabbed it, before slamming her head against Vega’s and ripping the knife out of her grasp.

&#x200B;

I had to move… I had to do *something!*

&#x200B;

I glanced at the necklace Temperance wore… and without thinking, I grabbed at it, ripping it off of her neck. Temperance’s eyes went wide, she looked at me, her expression one of shock and betrayal.

  “No!” She cried, “Justice, wait…”

&#x200B;

Vega squirmed out from beneath her, and stumbled away, while Temperance turned to face the entity shambling toward her. She tried to back away… but it moved faster than she did, dragging itself forward with its countless hands, reaching out for her and grabbing her.

&#x200B;

Temperance screamed.

&#x200B;

She fought.

&#x200B;

She cried.

&#x200B;

But the arms just held her tight as they began to pull at her… taking her apart as her screams echoed through the halls. I watched in horror as she was slowly pulled apart by arms that dragged her pieces into the creature's mass… devouring her in a sense.

Part of me wanted to help her… to save her.

But I already knew she’d been past my help for a while now.

&#x200B;

Vega grabbed me, forcing me to look away from what was happening. But I could still hear Temperance’s screams. And despite what she did… despite who she chose to be, I don’t think I’ll ever stop hearing those screams.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

After a ‘*police investigation*’, the deaths of Sarah, Amber and Anna were officially given the mundane but not inaccurate label of ‘homicides’ and the official story wasn’t all that far from the truth. Temperance had murdered three of the girls she used to party with while high, blaming them for the downward spiral her life had taken. Her death was ruled as a suicide driven by guilt… but I knew better.

&#x200B;

I let Dr. Vega and my Mom’s old colleagues clean up the mess the demon had left. They knew how to do it properly… but I did try and keep an eye on them from a distance. I figured I might learn a thing or two by watching.

&#x200B;

The stories Mom used to tell me were always full of magic and wonder. I always knew that there was danger, death and horror weaved into the. But she focused on the positives. Having caught a glimpse of the horrors that lurked behind the veil, I think I can finally understand why. It’s best not to think about those things too much, if you can help it.

&#x200B;

Still… though what I experienced that night shook me to my core, there was still some good to come out of it. I finally got to see the world Mom had told me so much about… the one full of wonder, magic, and horror. And now that I’d seen the horror… I couldn’t wait to see the rest.",1b0kecv,39,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1b0kecv/wonder_magic_and_horror/,"[""Been dying to write something like this for a while. People wanted more Justice stories, and I've been trying to think of a proper one to do. Hopefully this one isn't too self indulgent!  \n\n\nThis story had a lot of weird inspirations, the three biggest ones were:\n\n* I wanted to capture a Studio Ghibli type vibe.\n* I was really inspired by [this artist,](https://www.reddit.com/user/Simz88/) who draws cute witches and ghost cats, and it's all just SUCH a vibe.\n* I've been listening to The Birthday Massacre again, and realized [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlFN9G4MX7U&ab_channel=TheBirthdayMassacre-Topic) might be a great vibe for Justice. Once I started thinking about that, I revamped the spotify playlist I'd made to try and get a good vibe for her (which was pretty bare bones before this)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of right now - I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to be doing with my writing moving forward. I'm not going to stop or anything, but I'm still relatively low energy (I'll probably be low energy until I finish my Pokemon playthrough) and I'm also wondering if it might be time to make change of some sort.  \n\n\nI was thinking of going back to posting on NoSleep... but there's been a lot of concerns about Reddits new content use policy (I'm still forming an opinion on that) and NoSleep looks pretty dead. Idk if it's dead for good or just going dormant for a bit, but I guess we'll find out.  \nFor now - I'll be working with Lighthouse Horror, but I'm also contemplating where else I might be able to branch out to. I've got a lot of characters on this sub that I really love, and I'd hate to just abandon it all. Maybe I'll take another look at self publishing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr maybe I'll give in to my current urge to write a Danganronpa AU set in the world of The Walking Dead, because you can take the man out of the trash but you can't take the trash out of the man."", ""This was great. Temperance really took that whole lack of accountability thing to extremes. I'm thrilled to see another story from you."", 'Loved this!', 'Well shit. Gotta love the ""it\'s everyvody else\'s fault that I did the thing"" excuse. Very addict-think.\n\nLoved seeing Justice find her way into the world, and with Vega as a guide, no less. I love them both so seeing them working together is great 😁\n\nWherever you keep writing I\'ll be happy to follow, would be a shame to abandon all you have here but I get the issue. I already have an off-reddit setup which I use more than ever now, but finding reach is much easier on here.\n\nI\'m still trying to figure out the updated stuff but I feel like there\'s always this panic over companies just covering their asses so they can do stuff like reddit has with their google deal.\n\nBut on the other hand, if they really want to they can do some weird shit with what we create. I mean, I say we, reddit will never even know I exist, but bigger subs may fall into it.\n\nOn a third hand, they\'ve also admitted that more sub protests like the api one will damage them, so while they stuck to that change, they also have an incentive to not do more stupid shit 🤔 Doesn\'t mean they won\'t, just means they now understand what they actually risk and that their users can and will respond to being fucked over by fucking them right back, which means damaging their income, and that\'s how you make a company behave - hit their wallet. Less money soent on their VIP stuff. Fewer eyes on their ads. Suee a new revenue route is opening from google but that only goes so far - that route still relies on the big user base. So they still need to keep people here and interacting.\n\nAnyway, mini essay aside, all we have is either wait and see, or be proactive. At least you have options like Lighthouse, and people who\'ll follow you elsewhere! That\'s good 😁']"
What powers does Persona's have ? ,"Considering playing the game 

Was curious : what powers personas have exactly? 
All I have seen on vídeos make it look like they just blast enemies in different ways  ( explosions, guns, magic lighting etc) or straight up attack with fists and melee weapons 

 but when I haerd people talking about it,  they made it sound like there was a comlicated movesets and magic system that diferantiated each persona

I dont remenber exactly, but I am sure they mentioned lots of powers like ilusions, cloning, controling matter/  the enviroment, all kinds of different powers.

Anyone could explain ? 

If possible talk about one or more persona and their powers

Krono Tempus - Time Magic System update,"Just an improvement on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/16l31gg/time_power_system/) even gave it a name this time.  Won't mind any critique the power system is still really half-baked.

**Krono Tempus -** Power System based on different aspects of Time Manipulation and the effects it has on things.

**Vectors -** Vectors are individuals who can use the power system. The word vector is a quantity having direction as well as magnitude, especially as determining the position of one point in space relative to another or to direct to a desired point when it comes to aeronautics. Vectors were given this name because they can control the direction of time flow on things affected by their powers.

**Type of Vectors -** Vectors are separated into three categories based on their Krono Type. Loopers(Past Users), Stagnanters(Present Users), Prospectors (Future Users), and Paradoxes(Abnormalities, those who can use all three Krono Types, have more than one Affinity, or can affect Time itself).

**Affinities -** A specific target that Vectors can only affect. These things are Themselves, Objects(inanimate things), or Others(living organisms). Vectors can only have one affinity their powers can affect.

**Krono Type -** A temporal aspect of time manipulation that a Vector can use to manipulate the flow of time on their affinity. Past, Present, and Future.

* **Past(Time Reversal):** Users can reverse time on themselves, objects, or others.
* **Present(Time Reduction):** Users can slow down time even to a halt on themselves, objects, or others.
* **Future(Time Acceleration):** Users can speed up time on themselves, objects, or others.

**Krone Ability -** Abilities Based on a Vector’s Krono Type. Within each category of Krono Types are different branches of Krono abilities that Vectors can be used.

**Limiter -** Taking inspiration from the movie “In Time” each vector has a certain amount of time on their arm but only they can see it. The time on their arm is like a mana bar so every time they use an ability it will take a certain amount of time off indefinitely reducing it.

* Each vector has a visible time (mana) bar on their arm.
* Abilities consume time from the limiter.
* Killing a person restores only a minute, but killing another vector gives the remaining time on their limiter plus an additional minute.
* Time does not naturally regenerate; it's a finite resource.

**Time Lag -** Cooldown for using Krono Abilities. This time out for using one's abilities can span from 5s - 10s or at max 25s possibly higher if an ability uses a large gauge of the the limiter.

* Cooldown for using Krono Abilities.
* Quick-paced interactions with the possibility of vulnerability during cooldown periods.
* Cooldown duration varies based on the ability used and the depletion level of the limiter.

**Distortion -** The ways that Krono Abilities affect their target.

* State:
   * Alters the condition of the target by manipulating time.
   * Example: Speeding up time on a crowbar causes it to rust while rewinding time turns it back to its original state.
* Location:
   * Allows the skipping of time from one point to another.
   * Example: Rewinding time on a fired bullet puts it back in the gun's chamber, creating the illusion of never having been fired.
* Frame By Frame:
   * Instead of instant skips, this ability goes through each frame of an event.
   * Example: Rewinding time on a bullet lets it fly backward like a boomerang, repeating each frame of its original trajectory.",1b0jx77,12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/1b0jx77/krono_tempus_time_magic_system_update/,[]
Inconsistent quick-scoping others never seem to miss. Reveal the secrets..,"


OK, I might go out in a limb here or get roasted, so be it.  I don't really care anymore. 

For what ever this is worth, I'm master prestige level 200 on this game, been playing it over 5 years. (levels mean nothing of course).

What's the deal to mastering quickscoping and why is it inconsistent, at least it seems that way for me?

I have been playing and practicing it for literally years, and while I've gotten better, 85%  of the time I can't hit anything and get shot by the enemy with the same exact set up multiple times over AND at probably twice or 3 times the speed of my quickscopes according to the kill cam. Yes it's really that bad.

How come they never seem to miss and their kill feed shows them quick scoping ME and others at least 2 or 3 times faster with the same set-up.. it almost looks as if its auto-lock on target when we all know it's not. 

They also see targets before they even aim the gun to shoot and know EXACTLY where the enemy is, like how did they know we was there etc etc.. just hit fire and you’ll get the kill like LIGHTENING bolt quick. I  have seen people no scoping too coming down on a parachute/paratrooper, even on the way down they are shooting so fast and accurate it’s unreal! 

Am I missing something, somehow? I know it's about positioning too but what else.. 

it a modded controller people are using? 
They can't be cheating on Xbox?   -  it can't just be down to my skill because 2 games out of 10 I do half decent then it all goes to shit again, I have to switch to different gun or end up 2nd from bottom on our team!

I'm not that garbage, it's just the game sometimes makes me look like it but only with a sniper. Nothing else! 😂😂

Stuff I don't think it is;

My internet:  I have super fast fiber broadband which is the fastest in my area possible at this current time. I use a wired connection but have tried both.

It's not my monitors input lag either or my controller(s) both are wired. Sometimes I can hit decent quickscopes but most of the time get shot first. 

Somebody let the cat out the bag please and tell me how shit I am but what else...  I have every sniper and attachment unlocked and have tried every one of them with the correct attachments people use for quickscoping. 

Is this just a simple case of me never really mastering quickscoping? 


",1b0jqy5,5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWII/comments/1b0jqy5/inconsistent_quickscoping_others_never_seem_to/,"['Learning centering is really helpful in fps in general. QS has rhythm of timing the buttons too.', ""Could depend on the gun, I like to use the kar or 3 line rifle for quickscoping. I have every sniper in the game but don't use very many. If you use a sniper like the wz you wouldn't be able to quickscope easily with that rifle."", ""I feel like this is related to my recent post (https://www.reddit.com/r/WWII/s/NOrVHiobs6). Snipers and quickscoping isn't all modded controllers and aimbot. Most of us don't need that to be good. Instead, it's countless hours using the same weapons on the same maps and learning where people are going to hide or appear from. There's a few things you can do to help improve your game like finding a position you are comfortable playing in, focusing on the centre of the screen, learning how fast you can aim downright and reload, etc. There's so many things that can be taken into consideration when playing the game that can determine where an enemy is going to be. Once you learn that, then it becomes a little easier."", 'quickscoping takes a long time to master despite what coping erma players might tell you. it’s not cheats or mods, and if you have any clips of you sniping to go off of i could be of better help', 'I’m hopeless at quickscoping, but it could also have to do with their vertical/horizontal sensitivity settings. That could help them center faster than you especially while descending from the paratrooper insert. Maybe play around with that and see if you’re more efficient']"
Quick Menus for Weapons & Items need more than 4 Slots,"Something that keeps bugging me about DL2, there are so many amazing Weapons and Equipment but too few slots to have them all available at once.  


Equipment, unless you have Expert Grapple Controls enabled (which I don't cos it causes Issues when trying to perform certain Moves) it's already pretty necessary to have both the UV Torch and the Grapple as 2 of your Equipment Inventory Slots, Decoys and/or UV Flares are pretty vital too, which for me personally only leaves me with 1 truly free Equipment Slot. I want to use the Pan of Destiny and Explosive Knives and Grenades and Camouflage but it's such an annoyance to have to constantly go into my Menu to swap my Equipment out.  


Weapons, I want to use a Bow, and a Gun, a Blunt, a Sharp 1-Handed and at Heavy Weapon at the very least but again, 4 Slots feels so restrictive and having to go into your Menu to constantly switch them out really ruins the Flow.  


In general, for all the awesome Weapons & Equipment 4 Slots for Weapons & Equipment each feels way too restrictive. This would be a great Quality of Life Change I'd love to see implemented into the Game.",1b0iwry,9,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dyinglight/comments/1b0iwry/quick_menus_for_weapons_items_need_more_than_4/,['I definitely agree. Upping it to 6 quick slots or even 8 would be awesome. I think the game really needs an overall inventory and backpack overhaul. We’ve got so many cool toys with all the updates that it’s a shame I can’t carry them all with me. Maybe DLC 2 will have the backpack upgrades similar to how you had skill upgrades for backpack slots in the first game.']

why i win it easily

compare to Nato , Warsaw have Ostensibly Stronger Artillery, and more in quantity

&#x200B;

quantity:

these quantity are stack within an 'counter'  ,  

the counters Warsaw can control are just slightly more than Nato ,

Making Warsaw's  maneuver cumbersome , 

They cannot break up and spread out to avoid fire Or leave enough reserves to infiltrate , flank attack ,

in the game, AI Warsaw almost only march along the road and be destroyed from a long distance by direct or indirect fire. (On the other hand, there isn't much time per battle, If attacker take a more efficient roundabout rough terrain route, they may run out of time)

If Warsaw are crowded together, they do have a very powerful impact, but large units always destroyed More 'HP' at one 'Hit'. This just looks big . and artillery is devastating against crowded troops.

&#x200B;

Artillery:

If no troops maintain visual contact, damage of Artillery is poor ,

For Warsaw , Their reconnaissance equipment is worse. Except for the reconnaissance units, most of the troops are blind beyond 3 hex.

For Nato , As long as you repel the reconnaissance of Warsaw , Warsaw troop's Direct firepower is almost gone . 

The damage of Warsaw artillery was insufficient , and it became even worse after the front reconnaissance lost visual contact.

Some of my troops who were continuously bombarded were not suppressed at all 

For those units in urban terrain, I have no worries about being bombed, they only take little damage even from heavy artillery fire.

if Warsaw lose their reconnaissance , they High probability lose the battle ,

and Nato , for the US , all units have good reconnaissance capabilities, so the US artillery is particularly strong, even though they have fewer artillery units.

&#x200B;

Reconnaissance forces from both sides:

There are three types of US troops:

Ordinary unarmed reconnaissance vehicles, or reconnaissance rangers with MG vehicles, they are less effective in combat

Infantry armored vehicles with missiles like Bradley, very powerful and useful, they can defeat and repel the opponent's recon units , and kill many armor vehicle with ATGM

Warsaw troops:

Basically, they ride in vehicles with only machine guns, and infantry have anti-vehicle weapons only have 1-2 hex Maximum range.

If they encounter the US missile Bradley, They can't handle it .

if Warsaw player want to win the battle , they need to march in something like heavily forested areas , Fighting Close within 3 hex . and protect their reconnaissance with Combat capable troops (this adds a lot of burden) if Warsaw Want to conduct a flank attack or penetration attack .

smoke interference are ineffective , only rough terrain and dispersed in marching can effective protect Warsaw 

Note static troops are harder to detect 

&#x200B;

Mines:

The AI will always avoid landmines. You can use mines to force the AI to follow a route you prefer.

On this route you set up killzone and artillery 

&#x200B;

Melee (0-1 hex) and small unit:

My conjecture bigger 'counter' easier to hit .

Once the enemy fails to eliminate one unit all at once, it will be difficult to eliminate the remaining small units .

Within a few minutes I had a 1 HP infantry and a 20 HP Warsaw infantry fighting at a distance of 1 hex . both side are in light forest . Both sides kept firing .

before they are wiped out , they destroy 6 HP Warsaw infantry .

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've had trouble getting anything beyond tactical wins on the campaign so far - namely because of losses on my side.

I can't seem to find or see their recon units. Rarely do I catch a few.""]"
Is it just me or has there been a serious increase in police activity since this year started?,"Like everywhere I go I come across one or two cops sitting out on a spot to ticket people,  there’s also those who stand on the side of the road pointing their lil speed guns at oncoming traffic, there’s even actual police cars in certain schools now ( not reffering to school police cars) I’m talking actual street traffic control police cars. 

It’s kinda crazy, they hide out in certain parking lots with their lights on ready to catch someone zooming down an empty stretch of road

Back in the days it wasn’t like this, it was rare to actually find a police. Yesterday this guy in a uhaul truck was too lazy to wait for the light to make his uturn so he literally drove over a concrete median to make his u turn, within second a cop was nearby turned on the sirens and started chasing😱",1b0ipbw,44,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/1b0ipbw/is_it_just_me_or_has_there_been_a_serious/,"['I think your last paragraph sums it up as to why there are more cops.

[MECH IDEA] Two Players Pilot Mech,"I heard they will give players mech soon, so I just want to put in a piece of my idea. A mech that's required two players to utilize its full functions:

\- First player will control the whole movement of the mech and a front torso mounted lighter gun that can only shoot in front of the mech (prob machine gun or mini gun).

\- Second player will control two heavier guns that mounted on the shoulders or arms that have 360 shooting range (something like rocket, mortar, or energy).

With this implement, it will amplify the cooperative aspect of the game and its chaotic nature because players will make mistakes and miscommunication. What do you think?",1b0iot2,2,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b0iot2/mech_idea_two_players_pilot_mech/,"['I just want an APC.', 'I think this sounds a lot less fun than the original game. which could have 4 mechs equipped with flamethrowers and miniguns holding the line against even bigger enemies.\n\nAn unnecessary and unfun change']"

Virtual Desktop controllers angle with Pico 4,"Hi everyone!  
Is it possible to adjust Pico 4 controllers angle? I am using Virtual Desktop, and this problem is really not that significant there as with Streaming Assistant, but I clearly notice that items like swords and guns are pointing a few degrees downwards. I was playing on CV1 before, and there was no such problem at all. Now I wonder if I can adjust this in some config files, or maybe there is an utility app that can help me with that?  
Worth noting that I run games through steam vr, and my PICO 4 is shown there as a Quest 2, and controller position that I get at different games remains the same.

Part Two - Flying Backwards in ‘44,"Part One: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WWIIplanes/comments/1ay2jfp/flying\_backwards\_in\_44\_the\_memoir\_of\_a\_b17\_tail/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWIIplanes/comments/1ay2jfp/flying_backwards_in_44_the_memoir_of_a_b17_tail/)**Flying Backwards in ‘44Ron McInnis**

**Part Two**

https://preview.redd.it/kpb69ye6txkc1.jpg?width=2067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16736bba6c68b3395ce6dd2b01c06e43a37f727a

**One of the things stressed at Ardmore** was tight formation flying. As was said before, the heart of any bomber defense is tight formations. This concentrates defensive firepower. Along about the middle of our training, we started to fly mock formation bombing missions against different Midwestern cities. We would “bomb” Wichita, Topeka, Kansas City, and even St. Louis - with cameras, of course. We did everything but drop real bombs! We would even have “fighter attacks” from P-47s stationed at Winfield, Kansas. The fighter would come in on a pursuit curve and we would dry-run fire on them.

**One word about formation flying for long periods:** Pilots tell me it’s very tiring. It’s a constant fight with throttles and controls. It demands FULL concentration of the pilots. It can be very hard physical work, and threat of mid-air collision is everpresent. These “missions” were valuable training for all of us. The one thing lacking was the terrible weather in northern Europe. This is not to say that Midwestern weather is ideal. It can be very, very tricky, but the stuff that comes in off the North Sea and the Atlantic is much worse, in my opinion.

Part of our training involved night cross-country navigational flights. We would leave Ardmore and fly southeast into Alabama and Georgia, then turn north into the Carolinas and come back west through Tennessee and Arkansas. Some of these flights covered a thousand miles and more and were flown at the cooler altitudes around 6,000 ft. and were a treat after a hot day on the ground. The object was to give the Navigator experience in various skills, from piloting and dead reckoning to celestial navigation.

**John Joseph** came out of Navigation School at Hondo, Texas. Joe was exceptional. He was very precise in speech and manner. His voice was deep and he was tall. He could have played a very respectable Abe Lincoln in a college play. I used to love to hear the guy talk. His vocabulary was extensive, his phrasing meticulous. He would have made a great lawyer. Yet, there was not an ounce of falsity in the man. What you saw was what you got, a gentleman, through and through.

Joe was a conscientious Navigator. He constantly practiced “star shots” to enhance his celestial navigation. He never sloughed off anything. Every new challenge was gladly met and always conquered. This quality is borne out by his being offered a chance to become Group Navigator of the 385th.

**Now to the Pilots: Jerry Steil was an ideal son of the Midwest.** He was outgoing, but not the wordy type. When Jerry spoke, everyone listened, because every word had importance. He had the perfect pilot’s demeanor. Tall, blond, he looked like a pilot was supposed to look. As Airplane Commander, he was “no nonsense” in the air. He didn’t have to chew anyone out, because a straight look in the eye carried the message. Jerry came out of Aviation Cadets through Primary Flying School at Eagle Field, Dos Palos, California; Basic Flying School, Minter Field, California; and twin engine Advanced Flying School at Douglas, Arizona. He went into B-17 First Pilot school at Hobbs, New Mexico, and came out as an airplane commander.

We can all remember an incident overseas where another First Pilot, who was a Captain, outranking Jerry, was flying as our co-pilot when a procedural dispute arose. It became quite heated. Jerry, rather firmly, reminded this “two tracker” that HE was the Airplane Commander, and that HIS decision, in the air, was final. End of argument!

Perhaps my characterization of Jerry as a strong commander leaves the wrong impression of the man. He was not a military martinet in any sense. On the ground he was as pleasant a man as you would care to meet. He had a good sense of humor and wore a smile, not a frown. He liked his men and took care of them, and they liked him. He was always fair and considerate to all his crew. He was an easy guy to talk with. He was a good listener. His manner on the ground was never harsh with anyone. In a nutshell, he was a kind and gentle person who took his responsibility seriously. He knew that we were in a dangerous business and had the belief that the way to complete a combat tour, and have the whole crew survive, was to insist that every man know his job well and perform it to the best of his ability. We all reacted positively. We all wanted to get through the war!

**Mort Feingold** was our co-pilot. Mort was an excellent pilot. The Chicago native had also gone through Advanced Twin-Engine School, but wanted to be in fighters, specifically P-38s. Instead he wound up as a co-pilot on our B-17.

I had a feeling that Mort wasn’t totally pleased when he first came to Ardmore and that he would have preferred the more free-spirited life in the fighters to the more restricted four-engine life. The enlisted men thought him rather terse and abrupt at first. He came around though. He was smart enough to recognize quality in Steil, Joe, and Don Collins, officer cohorts in the front of the plane with him. Mort and Don became inseparable buddies.

One day, flying over Texas, Jerry decided to give all the gunners a shot at flying the “Big Bird”. Mort was in the left seat and we were called up one at a time for our “four-engine time”. As an aspiring Cadet I had picked up 10 hours of “piper cub” time at Washington State College. When my turn came, Mort said, “OK, give it a whirl”. I grabbed the throttles and the wheel and, after checking clearances, heeled her over into a steep ninety degree turn to the right then another to the left, back to the original course. I smugly thought ‘Not too bad’. Then Mort said, “OK, let’s try instruments”. After a few minutes the wind was completely out of my sails. Back to Reality!

**We had a great enlisted crew:** One of the real gentlemen was **Henry Clay Brier**. Hank was from Montgomery, Alabama. Hank’s mother and father were professors at the University of Alabama and had an obvious influence on Hank’s attitudes and intellect. He was a well-spoken man, with a voice that was calmness itself. Never got excited. He was a pleasure in conversation. Hank was one of our waist gunners and everyone’s esteemed friend.

The sad thing is that when we were flying overseas, Hank got sick with a case of flu at Grenier Field, New Hampshire and was hospitalized there. We kept flying the North Atlantic Route, but had every expectation that Hank would catch up with us in England. When we arrived at our Great Ashfield Base, we found that B-17 crews were cut from 10 men to 9. So when Hank did catch up, he went into the gunners pool and we lost him as a crew member. It was a sad moment for the crew. But Hank was still quartered with us and qualified as a “togglier” on Montgomery’s crew.

Toggliers were enlisted “bombardiers” who didn’t use the bombsight, but toggled the bombs in unison with the lead ship. Hank was one of the best of these. He later became an R.C.M. operator (Radar Counter Measures). These flying specialists jammed enemy radar flak frequencies by tuning in on them, thereby canceling their effectiveness. Hank was wounded as a togglier - not seriously.

The youngest member of the crew was **Al Boltz**, who manned the Ball Turret. This position was considered the most dangerous. Conditions in the turret were so cramped that the chest pack parachute could not be taken into the turret with the gunner. If the bailout signal was given, the ball-gunner had to turn the guns down to full 90-degree depression, then pip the doors and come up into the waist to put on his chute. It took guts to ride the Ball!

Al had a few oxygen mishaps while we were flying in Europe. It wasn’t inattention, but rather the ice in the exhaust ports of the masks. Ralph Vollmer, Waist Gunner/Armorer, adjusted the Ball Turret so that it had a certain amount of “creep”, if the gunners hands came off the controls. Ralph would watch the turret, and if it didn’t change direction in a reasonable time, but kept creeping at this steady rate, Ralph would call Al. If he had no answer, or a slurred answer, he knew something was amiss and would get oxygen to Al right away. I attribute this condition to ice buildup.

The turret was so confined that the gunner’s chin was always close to his chest. The exhaust ports in the mask were just under the chin. This allowed the ice to form a sort of stationary damn on his chest. Because the gunner’s views were mostly though the gunsight, there was not much head movement, which would have helped break up the ice. That’s my theory anyway. Take it or leave it!

Our Top Turret Gunner/Engineer was **Roland “Rocky” Tanguay**. He was the third man in the cockpit. His duties were numerous and important. He moved around to make sure that mechanical things that were supposed to happen, did happen. If the bomb bay doors refused to retract after bombing, he had to grab a crank, get out on the narrow bomb bay catwalk, without a parachute (the chute hampered movements with the crank), and crank about 90 turns manually to bring up the doors. This was done while looking at Germany five miles down, usually while in heavy flak over the target. He had an extra long oxygen hose to allow him to do this!

His other routine duties were checking to make sure that the main landing gear was down and LOCKED before landing. He was responsible for seeing that the ball turret was properly stored before landing, although the ball and waist gunner checked this for him. He called off airspeeds when taking off and landing, especially if pilots were on instruments. He also fired recognition flares when necessary. And, oh yes, he manned the top turret guns.

Radio Operator/Gunner, **Don Abens**, was a real asset. He was probably the best R.O. in the Squadron. He could send and receive 25 words a minute in code. The code was taken in five-letter groups, then decoded. Very secret stuff. The radio room was a fairly commodious space in the B-17. On the left, facing forward, was the operator’s desk, with a sending key, of course. Above the desk was the primary radio. On the right side was a rack full of “Tuning Units”. These had two handles and could be extracted and placed into the radio very quickly. It wasn’t my country, so, frankly, I didn’t know a lot about it.

All radios were SCRs (Signal Corps Radio followed by a number). At one time the radio hatch had a Cal .50 MG installed, but its field of fire was limited, so they took it out and the R.O. manned one of the waist guns when “Bandits” were about. I believe it was a way to create an extra “pool” of gunners. This led to the crew reduction from 10 to 9.

After his experience at Ardmore, Abe, understandably, “fell out of love” with guns. But in spite of this, when the call “Bandits in the area” came over the command channel, he would man the right waist gun, and we all knew the right side was more than adequately covered. Abe was another one of those guys that everyone took to. He had a love of humor and a great laugh. He was always consulted. His opinions always carried weight with the rest of us.

**Ralph Vollmer** was the Armorer of the crew. He manned the left waist gun. He was from southern Indiana and of German extraction. He was one of those “solid” men that you could always count on. These are the guys that are always there, thank God! He had gone to Armorers School at Lowry Field in Denver, and was expert with guns, bombs and turrets. The Bombardier always knew that if he needed help pulling the arming-wires from the bombs after take-off, Ralph would always provide expert help. Ralph was soft spoken and easy going. I never saw him really angry. If anyone on the crew could be called steady, it would be Ralph.

**I hailed from the West Coast.** San Francisco to be exact. The scion of a solid woking-class family of seven; four boys, three girls. I went to a Jesuit high school (St Ignatius), graduating in June ’43. Uncle Sam didn’t waste any time. I was in Basic Training in early August. I had passed the examination for Aviation Cadet, and after Basic, was sent to Washington State College as an Aviation Student for a semester.

At Santa Ana I came down with Otitis Media, an infection of the inner ear. My eardrum blew and I was eliminated from the Cadet Program. Later, at Amarillo, I was given another flight physical. The ear drum had healed and I passed the “sixty four”, the flight physical, and was assigned to Gunnery School! I was a bit perturbed at having lost the chance for pilot training, and vented my feelings to a few officers at Amarillo, but life goes on… Gunnery School it is!

At Ardmore, I asked for, and was given, the Tail Gunner’s slot. Never regretted the choice. Saw a lot of sky, a lot of B-17s, some heart-wrenching scenes of 17s going down, enough flak for one lifetime, a winter of the worst flying weather ever, and became a member of the best crew in the Eighth Air Force.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Sharnet, Venlil Investigative Journalist. Date \[Standardized Human Time\] October 30, 2136**

“IT’S THEM!” The dark brown Venlil exclaimed, “THOSE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING JOURNALISTS! DISGUISED JUST LIKE MALCOS’ WARNING SAID!!” Kevros’ wasn’t far behind in that realization, his wings slowly spreading out in the cramped cockpit. *Speh, not good!*

I looked around wildly for something to subdue them, and a large orange button caught my eye. I jerked out my paw, slamming it down upon it with full force, hoping it would something to help us. Suddenly, the main lights shut off, replaced by a harsh, pulsating orange. Alarms started to blare as the doors slammed shut behind me. *Welp, time to fight I guess!*

“Guess our reputations precede us!” I quipped, much to my confusion. *What is it with me and quips this paw?* I twisted around and ripped an emergency extinguisher off the wall, welding it as best I could…which wasn’t well. Thankfully, it appeared that we had caught the two off guard, as neither of them had a weapon on their person as far as I could see.

“Haven’t you two done enough?!” Kevros spat at me, flapping his wings to create a current inside the cramped space. “You already got Shorshen, you completely *broke* Halvone, I won’t let you take me, too! Perevil, get that imposter out of the pilot's seat! I’ll take snow-shoulders myself.”

*Okay, that wasn’t even a good insult!*

I blinked as the bird darted towards me. He lunged at me, his talons shining in the emergency lighting. No matter how exhausted I was, survival chemicals surged through me to allow me the agility to dodge the corrupt bird’s incoming attacks. I vaguely felt something scrape at my arms and torso, but I kept myself steady.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw as Vekna tried to fasten herself in the pilot’s seat. However, she was quickly ripped out by the far less exhausted Perevil, thrown against a nearby instrument panel with a grunt. I couldn’t pay attention for too long, though, as Kevros was still trying his best to brutalize me as best he could.

“What is it with you two?!” He screamed at me as I dodged another savage slash. “First the Capital, then Sidestar, now here! Is your connection to that damned giant really worth all this?! Hundreds, no, *thousands* of people out of work or worse, and for what? So you can get on some- some Predator-diseased *dick?!*”

My eyes widened in rage at his accusations. If the room hadn’t already been bathed in orange, it would have been now. *Did he really think I was only doing this for spehking* ***sex?*** *That’s what he thinks of* ***Tarlim??***

**DIE.**

I started going on the attack, Vekna’s scuffle blending into the background. My sole focus was on that pitiless MONSTER before me. My claws found purchase on his wings, a delightful screech coming from his beak as I ripped his feathers out. *He wants predator diseased?! I’LL SHOW HIM PREDATOR DISEASED!!*

A talon scrapes across my face as I swing the extinguisher in my hand. I felt the reverb through my arm as it connected with his side. He crumpled to the ground, and I wasted no time in mounting him. I raised the extinguisher over my head, ready to put him out of the fight for good, but I had a better idea.

I pulled the pin of the extinguisher. He was squawking in pain. *Mouth open. I shove the nozzle in place. Pull trigger. One second. Tw-* I was thrown off by a sudden weight, collapsing me against the door. At first, I thought it was Vekna, but as it wrestled the extinguisher from my hands, I heard the voice of a male attempting to restrain me.

Just as quickly, The mass was thrown off of me, my eyes struggling to adjust from the sudden darkness to see the threats around me. I heard a wheezing cough as Kevros lay on the floor, spewing out white particulates with each hack from his beak. Next to him, Vekna and Perevil were struggling as the fire extinguisher gushed its contents from its now broken handle.

“He hit the controls! Get to the controls!” Vekna shouted at me, the orange that clouded my periphery starting to fade. “The engines are powering! If they’re not ignited or aborted soon, it could detonate the fuel in the lines! Hurry!”

Heeding her words, I quickly leapt up, trampling over Kevros as I threw myself in the seat. In front of me laid a nearly incomprehensible mess of touchscreens, diagnostic panels, and tactile buttons. My eyes darted over the controls, trying fruitlessly to find the button, switch or lever that would start the engines.

“Uh, Vekna? What do I press?? I don’t know how to fly this thing!” I called back, not daring to take my eyes off the panel lest I find something I had managed to skip over previously.

“The flashing red buttons!” Vekna commanded as more sounds of scuffle sounded from behind me. “Press the flashing red buttons!”

I scanned over the panel, the alarms continuing to blare around us. Then, just as I was about to lose my mind, I spotted two flashing buttons on the control panel, each flanking a top-down silhouette of the humongous shuttle. *But which one stops the engines??*

“Which one?!” I called back out to Vekna. She looked back at me to respond, but just as she was about to answer, Perevil struck her in the jaw, eliciting a pained bleat from my partner. *I don’t have time to lean on her expertise. I need to actually take charge for once.*

*Spehk it, left one.*

I slammed my paw down on the button, and to my excitement, I heard the engines ignite on…the left side only? *Of course, the left button ignites the left engine, stupid stupid! Okay, follow through!!* The shuttle began to tilt to the right as thanks to the uneven thrust, throwing everyone else against the wall. In a panic, I pressed the right button, and the console lit up to signify their activation. But we were still tilted! *And starting to move!*

Instinctively, I grabbed the control stick and jerked it to the left. As the shuttle started correcting itself, I heard my passengers scramble to regain their balance on the floor, but it wasn’t enough. We were still moving sideways, and it was only a matter of time before the right side of the hull clipped the roof of the warehouse. That was all it took for the control thrusters to be completely overwhelmed, losing me control of the vessel. I covered my face with my arms as I was violently jerked sideways, the headrest barely able to keep my head straight as we crashed straight through the roof of the facility.

I didn’t lose consciousness, but Stars did I wish I had. My ears rang loudly from all the noise we made crashing into the building, the once deafening alarms now barely audible over the incessant noise. I blinked as my head throbbed, turning back towards the console. Flashing on the center of the console, I saw another flashing red button.

*Labeled Abort.*

I groaned, letting my arms fall from my face. They flopped sideways as I struggled to adjust to my surroundings. Sparks flew from the control panel, with the diagnostics showing a critical engine malfunction. *At least we won’t blow up any time soon.*

I heard groaning from behind me, so I turned my head to check. Behind me I saw the other three, each crumpled in their own heap. Vekna looked the best for wear, most likely due to being on top of the resulting pile, her only visible injuries being scratches on her left shoulder and a slightly swollen jaw. Next was Perevil, whose arm was certainly broken in the crash. A large gash was open on his head, dripping orange blood onto the floor…wall? *Whatever.*

Lastly, however, was Kevros. The feckless bird had taken the worst of all of us. One of his partially de-feathered wings was bent at an odd angle, and a couple of his talons had been ripped from their sockets. Whether or not that was from the crash or my scuffle with him, I couldn’t say. Thankfully, everyone appeared to still be breathing, meaning they were still alive. *Now to make at least two people regret that fact.*

I moved to unbuckle myself, the restraints proving tricky in my current condition. Eventually, I succeeded, falling to the wall with a thud. Sparks of pain shot through my battered body, but I wasn’t about to let that stop me. I limped over to Perevil, cuffing him to a nearby handrail before moving over to Kevros. The bird was still wheezing from the extinguishing gas I had forced down his throat earlier, which meant he would be unlikely to provide any meaningful resistance to me.

*Vekna.*

As her name crossed my mind, I heard her coughing behind me. She slowly maneuvered her hands to the floor before pushing herself up into a sitting position. From here, I could see something I hadn’t before, blood oozing from her jaw. *Brahk.* I glanced between Vekna and Kevros for a few moments, but satisfied that the Krakotl was too incapacitated to move, I opted instead to check on my partner.

“Vekna, Vekna are you okay?” I questioned as I knelt down beside her as she tried her best to look at me.

“Y-Yeah, I’m- *kff,* I’m okay. T-Took some shortlung inhalant a-a few \[minutes\] ago, just got the wind knocked out of me.” She rested a paw against her chest, which moved up and down as she tried to catch her breath. “Y-Y’know, you were supposed to go *up,* not sideways.”

I whistled in amusement, the adrenaline of the moment pushing me forward. “But isn’t that what we wanted to do with their plans? Make them go sideways?”

I felt a glare come from one of our prisoners at my joke. Vekna whistled, pulling herself up and-

***-crinkle-***

My ears jerked up at the sound of crackling coming from Vekna’s pack. Her eyes widened as she hurriedly opened it, reaching her paw into it. Her ears fell flat as she pulled out… a *part* of Lervua’s data pad. The device had been completely shattered in the chaos, thankfully having just barely spared her concealed weapon and holonote.

As I was checking my belongings for damage, Kevros coughed to get our attention. “A gun? Really? Maybe I was too- *kaff*, too naïve in assuming you just put people out of work.”

Vekna’s ears fell at the implications, but I wasn’t about to let this jabbering bird make her feel worse than she already was. “It’s a plasma gun set to *stun*, brahkass. Rich coming from you, considering everything your boss did.”

“Hah, you think I don’t know that?” The bird tried to retort, wincing as his wing shuddered in pain. “I’m not doing this for him, I’m doing it for *me*. Cycles I had to struggle under Rolem’s string-thin budget, this is just how I managed to get my rightful due.”

“By pedaling drugs,” Vekna panted. “If I hadn’t already seen how corrupt your offices can be, I’d almost be surprised.”

“It’s just business,” he said, “supply and demand. I’m a cog in that machine, just like all the other idiots you managed to nab. You think you’ve accomplished anything by doing this?”

“It looks pretty good from where we’re standing,” I shrugged. “Once we trace the remaining signals back to Malcos, we’ll bring him to justice and end this all for good.”

Unexpectedly, Kevros started to laugh, doubling over into another coughing for shortly. “You honestly think that, don’t you? I almost feel bad for you. Almost. Shoving an *active fire extinguisher* in my beak just about edges that out.” He tried to stand, but he was simply too injured, falling to the ground with a huff.

“Need some help?” I sneered at Kevros, his comment about Tarlim still in the back of my mind. “Don’t worry, I’m sure your former colleagues will be more than happy to help you up.”

Kevros simply lowered his head, chirping a solemn chuckle. “Don’t worry, I’m sure that they’ll treat me worse than you ever could. Unfortunately, I think I know exactly what that little trinket you broke is. I’m guessing both paid a little visit to Lervua?”

The fur on my hackle stood on end, which didn’t escape Kevros’ attention. “Thought so. I told Malcos that fatass’s daughter couldn’t be trusted. If he wasn’t so useful as a bribe sponge, he’d be cut out \[years\] ago, or so I’m told.”

“Where is he?” Vekna questioned, wobbling to her feet for just a moment before I saw her start to fall once more. I moved quickly to catch her, letting her support herself on me. “Where is Malcos?”

“You honestly think I’m going to tell you?” The bird spat, a small nick spalling from his beak from the force. “I’d rather take my chances with the Exterminators than piss *him* off. Without that pad, your quest is as good as finished. He’s going to get off-planet, and that’ll be that. All this destruction and chaos? It’ll all be for *nothing.* Let that sink in.”

Vekna looked to be about to say something, but I saw something spark in her eyes. “Sharnet, get me over to the access panel. I’ve got an idea.” I obliged, slowly walking towards the access panel and setting her down.

“What, do you think you can get this brick airborne again?” Kevros jeered from his resting spot. “Go ahead and try. I know you Venlil can’t tell, but I can smell the fusion fuel leaking from here. You try to ignite those engines again, it’ll be all our lives!”

“Shut up,” Vekna called out without so much as turning an eye towards the hostiles. Kevros’ feathers flared at her insult as Perevil started to stir. He groaned, trying to reach up to tend to his wounds. However, at that moment, he realized he was bound and started thrashing, which only resulted in further cries of pain.

“What the- Kevros! I told you we needed more guards! I told you we needed to do this sooner! You STUPID \[FUCKING SHITHEAD\] I-” Perevil screamed before running out of steam, lying in agony on the ground. *Seems they’ve developed a fondness for human cursing.*

“It’s of no matter,” Kevros sighs, the confident facade he had up to this point slipping away. “They broke their lead and Malcos is leaving next paw. Be quiet, and at the very least, *you* might survive in a cel-”

“Done,” I heard from my left. Looking over, I saw Vekna with her holonote hooked up to something buried deep inside the bowels of the console. She unhooked the data cable and made her way back to me.

“Done?” Perevil spat. “Done with what?”

“Black box,” Vekna panted simply. “This one is an older model, only saved the past three flight paths, but I got them.”

“It won’t do you any good,” Kevros snorted, “these shuttles come and go all around the planet, running deliveries. The chances of this one having anything useful to you are slim.”

“Let me see,” I requested, holding Vekna’s holonote to get a better look. The two most recent stops were here, which was understandable. The flight time on the most recent entry was only a few \[seconds\] long, but both it and the second entry had the same destination location. However, the third one was different.

“Scorched Sands… wait, that’s familiar.” I quickly pulled out my own holonote and typed the name in its search function. Soon, the results popped up, the name of a district prominent. “Scorched Sands,” I said once again, focusing my attention on Kevros’ body language.

“A small district bordering the sun desert of Venlil Prime that relies on pilgrims to the temple of Solgalick for its main export; tourism. And its magisters include… \*bababab-\*ah, here we are. Vane, Magister of Economics.” As soon as the words left my mouth, I noticed his crown feathers twitch ever so slightly. *Got you.* “That’s it, isn’t it? He’s in Scorched Sands? Right next to his little “bribe sponge,” as you said?”

Kevros said nothing, but his sudden silence was as good as any confirmation. My tail started wagging as I handed the holonote back to Vekna, her demeanor matching mine. “I think we’ve got our guy.”

Breaking his silence, Kevros sneered at us. “Good luck finding transport that quickly, you’ll need it. Oh, and you might want to make sure you didn’t kill *too* many people. Starship crashes tend to have somewhat of a mortality rate, not like you lot care about collateral damage.”

My ears fell as I realized the truth in his words. I hurried to tie the bird up before turning to Vekna. “He’s right, we need to make sure that nobody dies here because of us.” She immediately reciprocated and followed me through the lift shaft, which now laid at ground level. I thought I heard Perevil ask something about “the announcement,” but I wasn’t in the mood to hear any more falsehoods today. We had to make sure our other unwilling passengers were in a stable state.

**{-Resuming…-}**

Vekna relatched her container as I did the same with mine. It was rather easy to find the three containers. They were the closest to the front, and we had been able to remember their numbers. We only needed to open them up really quick before the groans told us nobody was dead. Sure, there were a couple injuries, some cuts and broken bones, but they would live. Live to spill all the crimes they have played a part. And the one still in the warehouse should be fine, so that’s all four containers accounted for!

“Okay,” I panted, moving around the spilled loose crate to Vekna, “as much as I would like to be here when the Exterminators drag everyone off, this likely isn’t something we want to take full credit for.”

Vekna wagged her tail in agreement, walking over to the cargo bay controls embedded in the wall. Or, well, Floor now. “Yeah, at least until they actually find all the drugs we stopped smuggling. *Really* don’t want to deal with all that paperwork again.” She knelt down, opening her pack. “Okay, if I can get this panel off I-”

The cargo door suddenly started sliding open with a crunching noise, causing us both to leap back in surprise. *She hasn’t even touched it! How is it opening?* As the doors raised to a halt, a pink form popped out from the edge of the shuttle. One of a… Worm?

“Sharnet! Vekna! There you are! You’re okay!!*”*

It was Leraninro, that sim… smigol… smigli- that worm person the former inmate family had introduced us to! He waved his mitten hands for us to follow, not really giving us time to properly respond. “C’mon! We all need to get out of here, I do *not* want that Exterminator grabbing us for all the drugs and carnage!”

Vekna and I shared a curious glance before opting to follow him out through the warehouse. It was no small blessing to see a friendly face. It wasn't particularly hard to keep pace with him, which was a welcome respite from the sprinting we had been enduring. As we turned the corner, I could’ve sworn I saw a glint coming from a shadowed alleyway, but I didn’t have the time or energy to invest much thought into what was likely a spare sunbeam reflecting off a pipe. Not with so much ahead of me.

*Stars, I’m going to sleep for a whole paw once this is over.*

"Some annoyances and ideas, what do you think?","I'm new to the Helldivers world, been playing Helldivers 2 since launch and I am loving it. Most of it at least! I've been writing down some things that I feel could be improved, as well as some things that might be cool additions, and I'd love to hear your opinion on them!

Annoyances:

**Gear balancing**  
Probably the one I've seen others complain about the most, and I agree. There's a few guns that are great, others that are far from, and overall I don't (yet) have the feeling that the stats of different gear makes a lot of difference, outside of the perks to be able to carry more of something or things like that.

**Remove thumbstick push to stop running**  
My biggest irritation BY FAR. Being slowed while being eaten alive by bugs is as close as I've gotten to throwing my controller through the tv. And I get that it probably has to be frustrating, at least a bit (although I wouldn't mind the slow being just a bit less aggressive). What doesn't help is the function to stop running by pushing the thumbstick down again, which is a tendency you have while being slowed. But now you have no clue whether you'll be running again when you can. In any game I remember playing, in order to stop running you release the thumbstick and push it forward again to walk. I think that's for a reason.

**Allow us to skip through the end mission overviews**  
All in all, the end mission overviews get a bit tedious if you're running back to back missions. At least let us skip through the animation part of it.

Ideas:

**Loadouts (sets of stratagems/guns/gear)**  
For each type of mission I've now found my favorite loadout. It would be cool if we could create sets of gear (armor, guns, strategems) to select before starting a mission, instead of having to click it all together every time.

**'Raids'/squad cooperation**  
I love to stand in the front of the ship and look down on the planet, seeing other ships attack the surface. Same on the planet, looking up/in the distance at the other ships, knowing others are doing the same as you are.. Down the line, I would love to see interaction between squads! Maybe in the form of what other games do with raids, bigger challenges that you can only do when teaming up with other squads. More destruction, more accidents :D but most of all MORE MANAGED DEMOCRACY!

**Shuttle expansions**  
It's cool when you're fighting against time for the shuttle pickup, it fires some shots as it lands, you only just manage to hop in and high tail out of there, covered in alien guts :D It would be cool if we could add more (weapon/) systems to the shuttle as well, to get more cover fire when being picked up for instance.

**Pimp your ship**  
Probably a controversial one. Our ships have potential! Right now they all look the same, but just like how I love to stand in the front, looking down at the planet, I also hang around and talk with my friends before we launch into a mission. I would love to have some cool additions to the ship that were maybe less functional, and more fun or cosmetic. Like the strategem game, but more of that. Whether it's a way to look at other players doing their thing on the monitor (like a built in Twitch almost, better than having to hear that darn commercial every time) or just have a fun hangout space.

Let me know what you think!

&#x200B;",1b0hn5y,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b0hn5y/some_annoyances_and_ideas_what_do_you_think/,"['Gear balancing is something that will happen, certainly. Bit of an annoyance, but not terrible.\n\nSkipping through the post-mission screen is a must. It\'s like a minute long. Ridiculous.\n\nLoadouts were in the first game, not sure why they\'re not in this one. Will probably come at some point.\n\nI could take or leave ""raids"", personally. The game\'s balanced around 4 people. Both in terms of actual numbers balancing like HP, damage, armour, etc. as well as the netcode. I won\'t pretend I know how hard it would be to make a 4-player game into like a 10-player game and make it stable, but if I had to guess, it would be pretty hard.\n\nShip comustomisation is a nice idea. Nothing too crazy, but I think some colouring and remodeling options would be cool. But this is also something I can go either way on. I think a uniform feels of the ships adds to the immersion.']"

&#x200B;

Hoshino:

[Eye of Horus](https://preview.redd.it/4iyl5913gzkc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dc1b4552b4386c62a1c797de6800893c8886257)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Despite the ""Little"" moniker, it's actually quite big.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nonomi (Swimsuit)

Machine gun that protects Nonomi even in midsummer.

The bullets it spits out refreshingly blow away the heat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Serika (New Year):

An assault rifle Serika carries to her part-time job.

Even the part-time job of a shrine maiden is no exception to this rule, and it comes handy to reign in bothersome children who cause trouble to others because it is the New Year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ayane:

[Common Sense ](https://preview.redd.it/xnr1h1ydgzkc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36caca6970c522e01b9f9dc4acf8a54182ebc2a)

However, that wish is always dashed in unexpected ways.

&#x200B;

A sniper rifle used by Makoto.

It is a genuine masterpiece, made by a renowned craftsman in Gehenna, that Makoto got to demonstrate her authority. However, Makoto herself prefers to give orders from the back rather than appear on the front, so she rarely actually uses it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Iroha:

[Pandemonium service pistol ](https://preview.redd.it/2zmncqcggzkc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=642a78d9e3c92e2f3a7245a6b440683d0050e034)

&#x200B;

A pistol carried by Iroha.

Being the tank commander of Pandemonium, she rarely uses it, and she always says that even at this size it is annoying to carry around, but even so, the fact that it is always neatly maintained speaks of Iroha's character.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ibuki:

[Bang bang!-chan ](https://preview.redd.it/o885re9rfzkc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=32fda832a386641f66b5c967d5b4706320456fc7)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hina  (Dress):

Hina's machine gun that she utilizes as if it were one of her own limbs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ako:

[ Hotshot ](https://preview.redd.it/hptodqtmgzkc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=64fccd2d8665c72f18b0589300ed59aad918a229)

It is a treasured object that was handed to Ako when she got appointed to the position of executive officer in recognition of her painstaking efforts. Ako carries it with her all the time and takes very good care of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ako (Dress):

A pistol carried by Ako.

Proof of ability as an administrative official. Ako has always handled this gun with great care, and now it is always at her side for Gehenna's covert operations.

Iori:

[ Crack Shot ](https://preview.redd.it/r0opgfapgzkc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=825c1b53e5b4bd246e02405ca23efc0b8a40b42e)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chinatsu's treasured pistol.

Small and portable, it is perfect for infiltrations into hot spring villages.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sena:

[ Emergency entry kit ](https://preview.redd.it/znp11vdugzkc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e5be3d226fadd16c1b59cef9adf5249ee347f3)

&#x200B;

A handgun that Kayoko usually carries.

As the name implies, it makes a loud roaring noise every time it is fired, so Kayoko had a silencer added to it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kayoko (New Year):

A handgun that Kayoko usually carries.

The loud roaring noise it makes with each shot comes useful not only for chasing away rude clients, but also for warding off evil in the new year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kayoko (Dress):

A handgun that Kayoko usually carries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A shotgun that Haruka uses to exterminate ""pests"".

Of course, it's also used when really exterminating pests.

&#x200B;

Fuuka:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fuuka (New Year):

A submachine gun that Fuuka always carries.

Juri:

[ School Lunch Club self-defense gun type B ](https://preview.redd.it/dizvkm0ahzkc1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6e223cf39536f7e89c6fd0d31ca31c7f0f78662)

&#x200B;

A shotgun that Juri carries.

Originally issued to control the troublemakers in cafeteria, for some reason Juri often uses it as a cooking tool.

&#x200B;

Former Times Union journalist Rob Port died last week. He helped edit the Secrets of NXIVM series for the Times Union --but he had some secrets himself.,"***Many thanks to*** u/2Djinn ***and*** u/ProtectionKey2069 ***for tips that were helpful to this post.***

The journalist John Robert ""Rob"" Port [died last week](https://apnews.com/article/robert-port-obituary-ap-pulitzer-1556f680440fa52050c7654bb826b5c0). He was 68, and undergoing cancer treatment in Lansing, Michigan, where records show he lived since 2019.

In his career Port was a co-winner of a Pulitzer for reporting on U.S. atrocities committed in the Korean War. For this forum, however, he may be known for the accomplishments as well as the controversies tied to the *Times Union*'s 2012 investigative reporting series ""[Secrets of NXIVM](https://blog.timesunion.com/readandreact/1565/secrets-of-nxivm-the-untold-story-of-keith-raniere/)"", where he served as editor over the team of Jennifer Gish and Jim Odato.

Though *Forbes* aired the absurdities of NXIVM's personality cult to Keith Raniere in 2003, ""Secrets of NXIVM"" in 2012 was the first time many came forward for the truly scandalous stories about NXIVM and Raniere: his harem of women, his secret love-child (whom members were told was a foundling), and most infamously his pursuit of underage girls.

Odato, Gish, and Port's work had tangible results. One unknown to any of them at the time stands out: the exposure of the *Times Union* series persuaded cult it had to do some damage control, resulting in Daniela's release from her solitary confinement.

# Curious Omissions Continue at the Times Union

Setting NXIVM's secret captive free may be as close as any journalistic outfit will ever get to the ideal of comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. That is far from the full story, however. And in some places, the lack of a story *is* the story.

For instance: Port's death did not prompt the *Times Union* to write their own obituary. They ran an Associated Press version instead.

This adds to the *Times Union's* strange silent treatment towards the 2012 investigative series about NXIVM, as well as the staff who wrote it. In the past, the *Times Union* published [self-congratulatory videos about their decades-long coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z34rdfFgHM8) of NXIVM, only to be chided by [downstate tabloid rival *New York Daily News*](https://www.reddit.com/r/theNXIVMcase/comments/jjnvxq/a_media_accountabiility_moment_ny_daily_news/) about the lack of credit to Gish and Odato.

I believe a set of circumstances explains the Times Union's selective memory-holing of one of its most important stories. It does not speak well of Port.

# Sheriff Apple and the Snake in the Garden

The ""Secrets of NXIVM"" series was published in February 2012. Port's personal legal issues began the next month --without apparent nexus to NXIVM, but with the story soon to cross over into that territory.

In March 2012, Albany Sheriff Craig Apple [raided Green Garden Asian Spa](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/nyregion/albany-times-union-editor-says-police-targeted-his-wifes-spa.html). Like many such spas, Green Garden had the reputation as a house of ill-repute (or in more modern parlance a [rub-and-tug](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rub%20and%20tug)).  Arrested in the raid was one masseuse, an alleged prostitute.

Port was not a client; he was, rather, the husband of the owner/proprietor. He publicly professed his own innocence, and that of his wife and the masseuse. Nonetheless, Port left the *Times Union* some time in 2013 under a cloud.

It took until summer 2015 for the legal issues of the raid to boil over. That was when the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/nyregion/albany-times-union-editor-says-police-targeted-his-wifes-spa.html) and [*Albany Times Union*](https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/three-years-later-prostitution-case-is-thrown-out-6422927.php) noted that the case against the masseuse from the 2012 raid had fallen apart. Port would claim to the *Times* that the raids were ""a carefully planned plot to retaliate against me and my newspaper"" --not for its coverage of NXIVM, mind, but for his coverage of the vice squad of the Albany Sheriff.

But Port's denials may not have been entirely candid: the *Times* and *Times Union*'s articles trumpeting Port and his wife's exoneration omitted to mention that Port's wife was involved in *yet another* massage parlor --[one, as documented by another *Times Union* article, raided in January 2015](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Sex-ring-busted-6020571.php) as part of a county-wide crackdown against traffickers. (The byline on this article was none other than Rob Gavin, who later covered the Raniere trial gavel-to-gavel).

Though Port and his wife were not prosecuted, they appeared to have been more strongly implicated than earlier: two women were arrested in the raid for prostitution, and both were living in a house owned by Port's wife in Flushing, Queens.

It is unclear what conclusion this case ever reached.

# The Vanguard Strikes Back

While Port's issues had no apparent connection to NXIVM, ""Secrets of NXIVM"" led to an undeniable wave of retaliation against the *Times Union* and its sources by NXIVM's legal team, who were willing to put every resource into the effort.

Most notably, this included civil and criminal complaints of ""computer trespass"" --none of which would ever stand up in court-- against various journalists and foes of NXIVM. There were raids and suits and court cases galore, none of which accomplished the stated ends of punishing a supposed hacking.

Yet the sheer tidal wave of litigation had its consequences. Neither Joe O'Hara nor John Tighe ""hacked"" NXIVM, but only threw rhetorical stones at the cult from their own glass houses --O'Hara was involved in a non-NXIVM related fraud; Tighe had severe issues with hoarding child sexual abuse material. None of their crimes can be excused, but it is hard to argue that either have gotten into in as much trouble without NXIVM's pursuit.

Other targets, like Toni Natalie and Jim Odato, were blameless but nevertheless were subjected to severe disruptions of their lives and livelihoods because of their vulnerabilities. Natalie, already targeted out of sheer spite by Raniere, [was raided and was continuously being sued](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2018/03/08/rochester-woman-battles-nxivm-keith-raniere/360847002/) until Raniere himself was finally arrested. And stemming from NXIVM's spurious accusations, Odato was basically [drummed out](https://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/11/journalist-on-leave-after-tangle-with-secretive-nxivm-group-003145/) of the *Times Union* and has suffered *damnatio memoriae* far worse than what commonly passes for ""cancel culture.""

# ""All a Smear Campaign""

Tying this all together, I am led to believe that Port was blemished by something far worse than marriage to an alleged madam. At best, Port may have been caught in a scheme where he gave NXIVM collateral-style blackmail material --not only to impeach his own credibility but others'.

And at worst, Port may have betrayed those who put their trust in him and the *Times Union* with confidentiality.

**Exhibit 1: The (Missing?) Tape**

Listeners to the Times Union's *NXIVM on Trial* podcast may remember a very uncomfortable moment in [the 2021 episode with Nippy Ames and Sarah Edmondson](https://pod.link/1462352368/episode/2d87e3dc6927e735e12061e6d0b7187f), when Edmondson talks about Clare Bronfman to Casey Seiler and Rob Gavin.

Paraphrased heavily:

>I remember Clare Bronfman coming into a meeting \[. . .\] and saying she was so relieved. Basically she'd gone in to interview somebody, and they had somebody who was dying of cancer or something --does this sound familiar like a high up person at the *Times Union?*  
>  
>I remember her saying that she'd gone in with Marc Vicente \[and\] filmed him admitting on his deathbed that it was all untrue and was all a smear campaign, and this she was so happy because this was going to vindicate \[NXIVM\] and prove that we were under attack. Then later the footage was lost.

Edmondson's question is followed by nervous laughs from Seiler and Gavin. They shrug off answering and imply that Bronfman simply told Edmondson a tall tale. I was inclined to believe them at the time. But today, knowing the context, I don't think this is entirely fiction.

The ""high up person"" does sound like Rob Port --who, as noted in his obituary, was a longtime cancer patient.

Last year --not long before her decision to flee Dossier Project, in fact-- [Nicki Clyne said she saw this video](https://archive.is/8RHfa), and [she explicitly named Port](https://archive.is/ebIDa) as the man in it. As in the second-hand telling by Edmondson, she believes that Port was dying at the time of the filming. Unlike Edmondson she claims Port to be dead, which we know was not the case in 2023, but which may be a matter of the telephone game.

None of the key facts are known for sure (yet). Did Port give a statement? When did this happen? Was it actually recorded, and what happened to the recording? I can't tell.

But the chilling effect of Port allegedly repudiating his work at the *Times Union* could not be denied: it would have added to Gish and Odato's legal jeopardy. It would certainly account for how gun-shy the *Times Union* became from Odato's dismissal in 2014 until the *Frank Report* / *New York Times* scoops in 2017. And it might explain why the *Times Union* is not mentioning any of the ""Secrets of NXIVM"" authors except in byline.

And crucially, the period of 2014 until 2017 is when Keith Raniere's brilliant idea for DOS came about. If Port capitulated and put the *Times Union* in check, that would certainly have contributed to his sense that he was bulletproof.

**Exhibit 2: The Lawyer**

A more tangible tie between Port and NXIVM seems to have gone unnoted except in a few places (specifically, lost posts of *Saratoga in Decline*). But it may have been the means of Port betraying his sources and his colleagues.

Reports on the massage parlor raids note that Port, his wife, and at least one woman arrested all shared one lawyer: Kevin Luibrand of Latham, NY.

Luibrand has a long legal career, having been admitted to the bar in 1984, and so he may be well traveled. But one prior client of Luibrand stands out: [Executive Success Programs](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4521747/nxivm-corporation-v-the-ross-institute/). And that representation was in NXIVM's case against Rick Alan Ross, aimed at censoring Ross and other experts from criticizing NXIVM's training materials.

Luibrand's work for NXIVM was, in fact, [covered by the *Times Union* itself](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Group-sues-its-critics-over-claims-it-is-a-cult-15640376.php) in 2003 --meaning it's unlikely Port or the Times Union staff were unaware of the conflict of interest.

As to the extent of his work for NXIVM, Luibrand worked on injunctions against Ross early on, but ceased working for this suit in 2004. But it wasn't unremembered at the NXIVM mothership: a transcript from a deposition has [Keith Raniere mentioning Luibrand's work for the cult](https://culteducation.com/pdf/nxivm/FILED%202009-03-11_K.%20Raniere%20Deposition%20Transcript%20(Confidential).pdf), unbeckoned.

This work included, I should note, the use of taped confessions.

This deposition was for the case against Ross in 2009, after it was removed from the Northern District of New York to the District of New Jersey. This version of the lawsuit was the same one for which Nancy Salzman was convicted on the charge of altering videotaped evidence. And it has had a bizarre afterlife, in no small part thanks to bickering between NXIVM's lawyers and their investigators.

About investigations: how much of his notes did Port ever give Luibrand? And how much did Luibrand give Raniere?

# Time to Break Silence

This is where we end. I admit I do not have much except a very nagging suspicion about the late Port having possibly been turned, or at least coaxed into some very regrettable decisions. It is difficult to grapple with.

But having this pulpit (small, albeit with great search engine optimization), I would like to ask some difficult questions for the living --namely, the staff at *Times Union* and the ex-NXIVM community.

What was the Times Union's knowledge of Port's connections to the spas and the circumstances of his separation from the Times Union in 2013? Did he truly jump, or was he pushed --and if pushed, was it for cause?

After Port's separation, did the *Times Union* know about the issues of Port retaining Luibrand, and were confidential sources who confided in Port ever warned of this?

Then there is the NXIVM survivor community, specifically Mark Vicente (and any others with knowledge): what to make about the alleged deathbed confession of Port? Did he, in fact, ever say that his own work was all a smear campaign? And if so, what was the context of such a statement?",1b0h7lh,38,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/theNXIVMcase/comments/1b0h7lh/former_times_union_journalist_rob_port_died_last/,"[""I hope folks will excuse a lengthy and meandering post. I think this post-mortem required it. \n\nI'd like to reiterate my thanks to u/2Djinn and u/ProtectionKey2069, who previously left comments about Port that served as breadcrumbs. \n\nAnd as a final postscript, I omitted the names of living third parties because there's no compelling reason to bring them into this forum. I'd hope others would respect that."", 'Fascinating details here and even as a fairly casual observer, I noticed that there was something odd about the way the Times Union dropped the ball on the NXIVM story after it did some great reporting.', ""Wasn't the deathbed interview the infamous deathbed visit Clare made to her father? I can't recall if he died from cancer though."", ""Taking Edmondson's second hand story and Nikki Clyne's claim she saw the video and named Port specifically at face value is kind of wild though isn't it? This is like taking at face value the things that people may have been told then repeated about Toni Natalie or any of the other supressives. Port's connection to the story and to some troubles of his own is obviously problematic at least in terms of the optics for the Times Union but I see no reason to believe this video exists. And even if it does why should anybody take it at face value given what we know about NXIVM?""]"

The aimpunch in this game is absolutely absurd.,"Even 1v1, the bot with a shield (and all automatic guns to lesser degrees) can juggle you 100-to-death before your noodle arms can even land near your cosmetic crosshair (while crouching with a better recoil control armor on) after peeking out of cover.

"A stack of gun laws are headed to Youngkin's desk, dozens of vetoes are expected","“We look, at the moment, like we’re going to get 37 different subjects of gun violence prevention bills through to his desk,” Andrew Goddard, legislative director for the pro-gun control Virginia Center for Public Safety, said. “We anticipate that he’ll veto pretty much everything.”

I think it’s a bridge too far at the moment in Virginia with the current governor.”

"If you could change something about game controllers, what would it be?","I'm a 3D CAD designer with access to 3D printers, and I'm working on a few custom built controller concepts, and I'd love to hear your input and ideas.  


At the moment I have a few ideas, but my main three improvement points are:  


* **Swapping of Trigger and Bumper positions.**  
'Triggers' are designed to be used by the index finger, just like you would on a gun, however doing so on a controller leaves the higher bumper buttons out of reach, which requires you to remove your index finger from the trigger to press the bumper, alternatively you can use your middle finger for the trigger, but this feels less natural and your index finger is wasted on secondary bumper actions rather than primary trigger actions such as shooting or aiming.  Playstation had the right idea before they switched to Xbox style triggers. The primary trigger action should be positioned for your index finger, and the secondary bumper action should be positioned for your middle finger.  

* **Removable Joysticks**  
There is no practical reason to have joysticks soldered directly to the circuitboard, a simple modification using 'jumper pins' would allow thumbsticks to be 'plugged' in and removed from the controller without any soldering. As soon as you experience stick-drift, all you need to do is pull the joystick out of its jumper sockets, and plug a replacement one in its place. No need for yearly controller replacement, and no need for expensive hall-effect joysticks.  

* **Face Button Layout**  
This one seems obvious, but is more difficult to execute.  
For competitive shooting games, you can't always afford to remove your thumb from the joystick to access the D-Pad or the face buttons, which is why people resort to using rear paddles or the 'claw' technique. I've tried rear paddles before but IMO it just doesn't feel comfortable, my brain instinctively goes to the face buttons as it just feels more familiar. I'd like to redesign the layout of the controller buttons to be accessible with minimal finger movement -  by moving the D-Pad to be on the back of the controller and making the buttons larger, accessed using your lower fingers as you would with paddles. - And the face buttons would be repositioned alongside the trigger and bumper buttons,  


Those are the main things I plan to focus on, but I'd love to hear your input and ideas!",1b0gagr,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1b0gagr/if_you_could_change_something_about_game/,"['You know how the steam deck has a whole bunch of extra inputs, like two trackpads, L4/R4 and L5/R5 buttons, and touch-sensitive sticks?

It’s been 10 years since I’ve played Saints Row and looking back at my old Memories on YouTube with Johnny “Zombie” Gat and mascots and Cops/Swats as Homies,"My ex taught me how to play Saints Row 3 and it was a fun game and I became very interested in it.. but it wasn’t remastered.

So I was just looking at my YouTube channel and watching how I managed to get Zombie Gat his big gun/ weapon, and I remember I always get him to get in the back of the Eagle helicopter 🚁 or other helicopters I forgot which ones.

Then I watch an old video and zombie Gat was holding a mind control gun lol I don’t even remember how he did it or what happened?
But now that I have my own Saints Row 3 and yes it’s remastered and I’m done with all my missions, I’m going to see if I can get him to have the mind control gun..

On this remastered version only thing I hate is that I don’t have cops/swat teams as homies, but I do have zombies homies.. 
And I don’t have Mascots as homies either 😢 

Lol but on my old SR3 I did created Dora the explorer and had a monkey as a homie and a random homie pretending it’s Diego (from Go Diego Go) with Zombie Gat too and posted it on my YouTube channel 10 years ago…

Also on my old SR3, I don’t remember if I got Jenny as a homie or what Mission was,…. But I do have her as a homie on my remastered version.
I can’t remember the exact difference between Saint Row 3 and Saints Row 3 remastered.

Newbie help,Been playing on and off for two seasons. Never very serious or whatnot but this time I want to try ranked out. I unlocked conduit because she seems strong for team play and maybe help me win 1v1’s. Got any general tips? Also any good gun combos ? (I don’t have anything in mind atm) I’m playing pc on controller ,1b0fd0k,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/conduitmains/comments/1b0fd0k/newbie_help/,"[""It's really tempting but try not to use your tactical on just yourself if your team is alive. The ult is best used like a thermite grenade, you use it to flush people out of cover or to block off an entrance.\n\nI would play her a bunch in mixtape or Straight Shot to get used to how to use her abilities before you go into ranked just because of how much slower ranked is"", 'U can use her ultimate when an entire team is camping/ressing behind a box.

Firing range changes from a player that spends alot of time there. ,"please make the dummies in the firing range have alot more health It's unfortunate to go in there just to 1 tap the small targets and barely put a clip into the regular sized ones it makes it so much harder to get a good feel of the weapons I like let alone try new ones and really practice recoil control. There's too many targets all grouped and lined up in a interesting order it dosnt allow for proper target practice and messes with the aim assist. The way there lined up around the spinning machines feels like the puzzle were you have to clear the disciple camp to get the glyph and not really a firing range. (Per example) 8 easily visible targets with the maximum health a renegade can have in game will allow people to choose what guns they like and what guns they find not so viable. As you walk in the dummies stand still but when you press the start button they start to strafe side to side. And finally let me be able to go in there with my group so we can try support/recon abilities and 1v1 if wed like. I truly believe something in this direction would make the firing range a much more productive and engaging area in game

Won the store's first tournament for the greater good!,"Our local shop just started doing warhammer events like crusades and Escalation leagues, which for the 4 leagues i got 1st,1st,3rd,3rd (most recent 3rd was my ad mech)  and then they did a invitational tournament for all the top players of their store and sister store (each store did a mini tournament to dictate their top 6 and then we did a reverse pairing then swiss style after based on wins and points)

and after 10 long hours I came out on top repping the blue satyrs 

Below is the list i ran and i was staying away from the crisis meta and found great obj control and fire power with this list as i ended at 234 points (would've been more but had a T2 concede) 

Round 1 was sister's of battle 100-16

Round 2 was Ultra marines 34-26 (conceded T2)

Round 3 was Tyrannids 95-77 (fun fact take and hold is one of the missions where you can't get 100 points since max primary is 45)

Letter to your Republican Representatives," How do you as a Republican justify to yourself the party's absurd stance on so many critical issues: 

1) Supporting 'Anti-abortion' when politicians should have absolutely no say in a woman's health care, and promoting such absurdities as the IVF ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court; 

2) Refusing to provide immediate major support to Ukraine and Palestine - if Ukraine falls, the blood is on the hands of squabbling Republicans and Trump; 

3) Studying the homeless situation ad nauseam - do something concrete - build a shelter, build 10,000 shelters, just do it!; 

4) Making the border situation become a crisis through failure to act now and pretending Trump can fix it with internment camps and mass deportations including agricultural laborers;

5) Supporting Donald Trump as Presidential candidate: a philandering misogynist, a tax evader of the worst kind, an insurrectionist against democracy, a 'pal' of Putin and other anti-democratic autocrats, personally benefitting from public office, and twice impeached in Congress;

6) Pretending that Trump can make things better when you know he will make things worse;

7) Considering tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of social services, libraries, schools;

8) Continuing support for hydrocarbon based energy production to the detriment of the environment, clean air and water;

9) Attempting to de-regulate carefully considered EPA rulings designed to improve the environment - California has gone beyond EPA with respect to regulation and has prospered!;

10) Attacking the educational system at the school board level with book banning, curriculum limitations, and racial discrimination;

11) Reversing or limiting gun control efforts and existing effective legislation;

12) Politicizing such Congressional issues as Government funding on a recurring basis;

13) Spending time and my precious tax dollars trying to impeach Biden and other democrats on ‘trumped-up’ unsubstantiated charges.

HOW TO SUCSESSFULLY ESCAPE THIS HABIT FOR GOOD 🤲,"Dear brothers and sisters,

We are all afflicted in this matter, some of us have quite frequent relapses and others may be on a streak, but the fact is that when it comes to the haram the prophet told us to quit no matter what, and when it comes to doing good deeds he told us to do our best. We have seen various motivational videoes in youtube, asked local imams, even talked to my parents and good friends about this matter, but i will give you a list over things you have to do, in order to sucsessfully escape this habit for good. It worked for me, and its quite crucial we follow this now, 2 weeks before ramadan, to achieve the fully awards of fasting. I hope that Allah (swt) makes it easy for all of us, but we have to go hardcore, so I might sound abit harsh but this is the remedy:

\- **Cut out music and replace it with nasheed or quran recitation** when you at gym or travelling. Music does not give you anything, just a short dopamin kick, while Quran recitation will keep you away from sins and it will also comfort the heart. Dont get me wrong i used to love music, i have even produced some rap songs myself, but when i found out why it is haram and the effects of the lyrics we listen to today which is full of lust, money, boasting, zina, sex, drugs, alcohol, money wasting-> these are all things that Allah hates. Those hearts which are occupied with music will not taste the sweetness of quran recitation. As it is written in Surah luqman  verse 6: ""from the people are those who use idle tales to mislead people from the path of Allah without any knowledge and they take this (quran) as a mockery"". The background for this ayat is that some pagan Arabs used to utilize singing, dancing, chanting, etc. to distract people’s attention from listening to the recitation of the Quran, when it was being recited in public. So quit music brothers and sisters, it is haram, and especially that music we listen to today. There is also a hadith from Sahih bukhari which states this too. How many songs do you know of by heart, and how many surahs? Every place where there is happening sinful acts like clubs it is always with music and never without. It should tell you enough.

\- **Cut out youtube, netflix, dramas, movies (hollywood and bollywood), online newspapers, every kind social medias**: this might sound abit harsh, but i know that many of my triggers to bad thoughts occour from these things. There is a high chance that a lustful image or a beatiful woman will be portrayed, even though that was not your intention, but that leads to zina. You know it. So cut it out for ramadan.  Replace it with islamic programs to increase your knowledge, it will benefit you more than you can imagine.  There is an app quranic, where you get a verse a day to translate in arabic and you can also read quran on your phone with other people around the world. A great app. You are forbidden to use any internet connected device after 9 PM and not in a closed off room.  Definitely not while lying in bed.  If you are pakistani cut out watching dramas with family -> they only portray romantic realtionships and zina to mislead people. Nowadays drama also include short clothes, drugs, alcohol and guns. They are not suitable for family times at all. Go watch PSL :D

\- **Cut out bad friends which are indulged in zina, or this habit, or make sexual jokes that makes you indulge in this sin.** Just cut them out because they also distract you from the path of Allah. There are plenty of good people in the masjid, at the gym, who are true believers and who will actually strengthen your faith. I am a medical student and i had to cut out alot of friends from my year.

&#x200B;

\- **Read Quran 1 hour every day, pray your prayers in time, and start fasting mondays and thursdays, eat less when you are eating, prioritize sleep**: all these things will keep you away from lustful thoughts and help you focus better on your daily tasks. Find a time to read the quran every day no matter what, for me it is after magrib like 5 pm. Fasting might sound difficult but trust me, i even go to university and gym 4-5 times a week and i have never felt more energy and focused than before. It will also help your gut clean itself and it is a sunnah from the prophet we should all act upon. How good do we not feel when we fast in ramadan. Eat less when you are eating dinner: many of us eat like 2 plates of briyani and BBQ -> i was one of those because i had to bulk for gym -> but a full stomach in the evening made me fall into sins. Eat less like the prophet. Priotize sleep, try to get 8 hour sleep and wake up for fajar: in that way you will feel tired at the end of a productive day so you will most likely go into bed than staying up all night doing nothing. Remember never to waste your time -> you never know how much time you have left, and especially in our old age we will not have that much energy and time and health. Always strive to do as many good deeds as you can, because good deeds remove sins.

&#x200B;

**Make plan for yourself every day:** For this i use [any.do](https://any.do) app where i can make a plan for what i am going to do every day: like read 3 hours this chapter, 1 hour questions and go to gym at this time. It helps your brain stay focused and you will also feel great when you complete your daily tasks.

&#x200B;

**Try to remember to do a lot of zhikr and to only have positive dreams and thoughts throughout the day:**

\- This is very important to have a good mood all the time, and something which helped me alot is doing zhikr all the time when im on the bus or walking outside, or just waiting for something/someone. Just move your lips. These are light words on your tongue but will have a great weight on the day of judgement. If you do get any sexual thoughts then run from that place, dont use any internet connected device that day, pray 2 rakat, read 1 page of quran, do wudu, or go outside for a walk.  Just change your enviroment. Something that worked for me is to go down to my parents and talk to them for 15 minutes straight. DO NOT GO ON YOUR PC OR PHONE, OR DOWN TO WATCH TV -> it will lead you to sin because you know that shaytan is whispering to you -> what does shaytan hate -> prayers and quran. So run towards which is good. Remember that a urge will last for 5-10 minutes maximum, and you will be fine the rest of the day. This is the moment you have to control. Did you know that your get 70 times as much good deeds when you have had a bad thought of commiting a sin but you dont do it, but rather follow it with a good deed.

&#x200B;

I am sorry for this long post but these 6 points will truly help you to get out of this habit. Some of us are really depressed and desperate and we really want to get out this issue. Then you have to follow all 6 points without leaving any of these doors open for shaytan to come. Any trigger will make you lose. So you have to go hardcore, for the sake of Allah. You really want to get better before Ramadan reaches you, then do this, no matter what. I will keep you in my prayers <3 ❤️

DP28 (pizza gun) should be standard loot on Vikendi,"In short, DP28 is my favorite gun, low rate of fire, smooth recoil control and high damage per bullet.

Problem: it only spawns on Erangel and on special zones on Taego.

Solution: it should standardly spawn on Vikendi too, the map is ex soviet union just like Erangel so it only makes sense.

Other problem: we need an alternative LMG to the M249 for every map, more LMGs are needed

How would the Girls und Panzer TV/DVD series approach cold war/modern tanks?,"Just a thought I've had for a while after watching the anime and film series (not the manga series). How would the films approach the use of more modern tanks than the WW2 tanks in use right now (I.E:  Current schools using tanks in early cold wars such at T-55, M60 Patton or more modern tanks such as the Leclerc, Leopard 2 and maybe even the Type 10 MBT) in contrast to when WW2 tanks are used? I know Dream Tank Match DX already allows you to use the Type 10 MBT, but I was wondering how the TV/DVD series would handle them.

In case you don't know, and from what I know, the newer tanks don't just improve on armour, shell types, speed and what not, but also on electronics. Early cold war tanks (E.G: Centurion Mk.3) introduce gun stabilizers, which allow the gun to be stable while on the move, making firing on the move much easier, oh Gloriana your time to shine. Tanks started also including thermals, allowing tanks to see other tanks easier and in the night. Newer tanks have laser rangefindingers for much easier rangefinding and fire control systems to help track targets on the move. 

With these features in mind, how would Tankery matches go? The tanks that the current series use already break all known laws of physics (not that its a bad thing) and perform unspeakable things that shouldn't be possible, what would cold war/modern tanks do? Would they all be as fast, maybe even faster than Rosehip's Crusader that they all go wild? Or arenas would become much bigger since engagements are at much farther distance? Would night battles be more common and shown due to the inclusion of thermals? 

And the last thing I wanna wonder: What about Ooarai and other poor schools? The big four schools, especially Saunders, would have no issues in acquiring new tech, but what about schools like Ooarai or Anzio that have issues in budget? Do you think the federation would lease a few newer tanks for all schools? Would they impose a limit to these tanks or do absolutely nothing with these struggling schools like they did before? Would Ooarai's unpredictability and unorthodox nature be able to pull themselves out of a 200% harder fight than what they have had before?

What are your guys' thoughts?",1b0d8cw,9,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/GIRLSundPANZER/comments/1b0d8cw/how_would_the_girls_und_panzer_tvdvd_series/,"[""My thoughts are that it's twenty past nine on a Monday morning and this question is being asked again after being pitched on Saturday, and for what feels like the tenth time this year alone.\n\n'GuP with modern tanks' is asked almost as often as 'Why is Mako touching Saori's boob?' and 'Why 'Murica lose in first round? IT AIN'T FAIR!'\n\nEdit: I'm admit, I'm prejudiced against modern tanks because the discussion always devolves into 'Abrams supremacy! Every thang else sucks!', 'No tank is better than the Motherland's!' and 'Japanese tanks fight Godzilla! Try and top that!'  \nWith my countrymen constantly boasting about how the only Challengers destroyed in combat were destroyed by other Challengers..."", 'ATGM spam go bbbbrrrrr', 'Much larger engagement areas would have to be used for tanks with laser rangefinders, especially since later subcalibre projectiles have comparatively flat trajectories so aiming would become quite trivial within the first ~1,200 metres. \n\nThere would almost certainly have to be either age/technology classes similar to weight classes in martial arts, or a weighted ""point buy"" system where more powerful modern tanks like the M1A1 Abrams or Leopard 2A4 take up several vehicle slots in a roster compared to something more austere like a TAM or Stridsvagn 104 (basically just a 105mm Centurion with some upgrades made to it). \n\nThere are a _lot_ of technological elements in post-WWII tanks that could make matches more dynamic and complicated. Laser warning receivers, hunter-killer systems, explosive reactive armour, thermal-obscuring smoke grenades, coaxial autocannons, remote-operated machine guns capable of penetrating lightly-armoured vehicles, gun-launched missiles and more. \n\nFor _tanks,_ luckily enough the problem of ""new tanks are expensive"" existed for many poorer or less militaristic countries in real life as well, and was addressed by things like upgrade packages for older tanks to keep them useful (rearming a T-55 with the more capable 105mm L7, or sticking ERA and modern fire control systems onto an M60A1) and cheaper tanks for developing economies (such as the TAM, basically a Marder IFV with a tank turret), not to mention the post-Cold War detente where a T-72M1 could be had for a song by tank standards and T-55s were practically being given away. The \n\nOne big problem for poorer schools would be _ammo._ The specific ammo you use with your gun matters far more in a Cold War context where guns were often replaced quickly enough that different ammo for the same gun didn\'t really matter as long as it was the same _type_ (AP/APC/APBC/APCBC, APCR, APDS, etc). But guns like the 100mm D-10 used by the T-54/55, the 105mm L7 (and M68) used by most western tanks from the 1960s-early 1980s and the 125mm D-81 family (2A26/2A46 and derivatives) continued to be used by leading military powers for decades - to this day in the latter two cases - with massive differences in penetration capability between, say, 3BM9 and 3BM42, let alone the difference between WWII-era BR-412 APHE and Belgian-made M1000A1 APFSDS for the D-10T2S. \n\nMaintaining a regular supply of good-quality ammunition would probably be one of the biggest cost factors in fielding a team for Sensha-do, and would make fielding as many tanks as Pravda or Saunders tend to very impractical unless you have Saunders\' _budget._ No point operating 50 tanks if you can\'t afford 50x a full loadout of good ammo per match, plus ballistically-matched training ammo. Anzio would probably be stuck with cheapo ammo that can\'t kill anything newer than an M48 or T-62 from the front. \n\nThere\'s also the question of how exactly you handle _depleted uranium_ ammunition, used by the USSR, USA and UK in addition to the more universally-used tungsten, and the depleted uranium _armour_ inserts used on some M1 Abrams tanks. The movement of radiological materials across state borders is strictly controlled and plenty of countries don\'t even want to expose their _soldiers_ to it, let alone teenaged girls. It\'s a potential carcinogen risk, not to mention the possible effects on fertility later in life - both of which making it a liability nightmare. But without some way to model it, you\'re handicapping the combat effectiveness of the vehicles and weapons that employ it, and sensha-do seems to insist strictly on live ammunition against real armour so I\'m not sure if the people running such a league could be convinced to use a simulated modelling method.', 'I feel that this is why the use of ww2 and ww1 tanks is ideal, they may have actually come up with the idea of upgrading them as the senshado is many years old right? but the cost of modern equipment and the difficulty to implement it would be a problem to address, which could be simply ignored, using the above mentioned tanks  \nIf now the big schools have overwhelming advantages over the small schools, with modern equipment it would be even more unfair than it is already', ""In terms of matches, they probably wouldn't change too much. At most, maybe some arena changes if they wanted to simulate actual battlefields where tanks have fought in (Cold War era saw the Korean and Vietnam Wars). Night battles might be possible\n\nThere may be a change as to who would still be able to be the champion though, when you consider that Pravda would potentially be fielding tanks that are already established to be under-performing when stacked up against Western-issued equipment. Saunders would potentially be able to take the crown, although they would likely face serious opposition from St. Gloriana and Kuromorimine\n\nThere's a possibility that some schools with smaller tank forces might band together and field a single allied force to gather the numbers needed, or they'd just offer their services to any of the larger schools (if you can't beat them, join them). I doubt the Federation would show any mercy"", ""Didn't the movie answer this question when the college team was armed with post-war tanks?""]"
Beat Tomb raider 2 for the first time earlier this week!,"Unlike tomb Raider 1 my only experience with TR2 was just goofing off in the mansion and messing with winston so unlike TR1 the game was new territory for me and nostalgia wasn't really a factor with the stages themselves.

First, right off the bat lara looks better AND controls better.  She's a bit more responsive compared to TR1 and in general TR2 looks better than the first game. The new climb up mechanic is pretty slow, but kinda cool and I like how you can jump off while climbing and even flip midair, something I didn't find out until like the last two levels LOL. The new grenade launcher is HILARIOUS, it's great seeing enemies blown to little polygonal gibs by it. The auto-pistols are great too, but the harpoon gun sadly is a letdown. I didn't get a single kill off it and was just better off running away from underwater enemies and shooting them from the surface. I like how you start with the shotgun too, and TBH I should've used it more cause unlike TR1 the pistols can't carry you entire game as easily. More on that later. I didn't use the assault rifle much because of the delay while moving. Uzis still rock.

The story admittedly isn't as interesting as the first one, I think probably due to the lack of interactions between Lara and the main bad guy or any notable goons. None of the mafia really have distinct personalities or names aside from the revolver guy and the pilot who gets punched.  No witty banter between lara and henchman, no fun cheesy lines from goons like Pierre or Sk8tr Kid, and the main guy I don't think even really confronts Lara outside of dragon form? Also while a conflict between  a group of tibetian monks and a mafia cult should be awesome, and certainly is in one level, I do wish Lara had more personal stake in it.

But anyway the levels! The meat and potatoes of TR games!. Once again the levels are visually a step up for the most part, and I feel like The Great Wall is a great intro level. It was kinda hard for an opener but a good example of how TR2 is gonna kick your butt more than the first game and I found the traps really fun. Also the idea of going into the great wall of china with these crazy death traps and T rexes is just the kind of awesome craziness that makes TR so great. Venice marksa radical shift from Tr1: a modern city, fighting modern dudes, with modern guns? Driving a boat? It's a direction that I wasn't sure of but in this level ended up  really fun, and I thought the boat pretty cool to figure out. Bartolli's hideout was great, and my personal favorite of the Venice arc levels.  In fact, I'd say it's my favorite level of the first half of the game. Opera house...\*sigh\* yeah I hated this one. I couldn't wait for it to be over by the end as I found it sort of dragged, had too many enemies  and was kind of confusing to progress. Oh and the fan section sucked.  The rig levels, unpopular as they are, weren't too bad for me. They weren't visually interesting but for the quintessential ""Lara is captured!"" mission, it was fine. Diving area is a bit unnecessary but again I didn't find it too bad and it was definitely not as frustrating as opera house.

Now we go down to the boat levels, which I'll be honest, are my least favorite ""arc"" of the game. 40 fathoms I kept dying at the start lol, but once I figured it out the rest of the level wasn't too bad. Maria Doria was ANNOYING, I wasn't crazy about this level as it had quite a lot of sudden deaths and it took me nearly 2 hours cause I couldn't find the last circuit thingy.  This level felt like a real chore and while the concept of being an upside down Titanic was neat, the scenery wasn't enough to really keep me interested in staying. Then we get living quarters, which is like a breather version of this level. This one wasn't particularly noteworthy  but not offensive either. But WAIT, now we got the decks.

The freakin decks. Okay so by now I'm tired of the boat and want off. This one at least takes place in a cave too so it's a bit more varied visually but I didn't really understand how to progress so I tried using the boxes to jump on the helm ledge to then jump into the cavern across from this. You're not supposed to do this however, you're instead supposed to move the box to reveal a keyhole. As a result, I sort of did the level in reverse and broke it even by entering a flooded room from behind and getting stuck, resulting in me dying. Ugh this was the 2nd level in the game where I had to swallow my pride and look up online how to progress. Oh and if you mess up the jump on the lowest level on the deck and end up there, it's a long trek back up or a reload.  This level took me over 2 hours and ngl, the whole boat segment dragged the game down for me. But at least we got the serpah.

Thankfully, we hit Tibet and this is where TR2 starts to get good again. The snow mobile controls messy but it was fun to ride in and the stage wasn't bad.  The catacombs were fun with the freaky yeti cells, and while ice palace's springy platforms should be fun in theory in practice they honestly sucked cause of the fall damage lol. But the fight with the garuda dude at the end was kinda cool, even if really easy.  

I skipped the monastary not because I forgot, but because I want its own section to gush about how FANTASTIC this level is. This right might be one of the best levels in either game, if not the best. Smart level design, clear goals that leaves you to intuitively figure out how to advance it, a sense of urgency with the story in how the mafia mercs and monks fight each other, visually impressive(both remaster and original look great, nice atmosphere, challenging traps but not to where they feel unfair...it's just classic TR firing on all cylinders. This was easily my favorite level in the game.

So last arc is return to china arc, and it starts with the temple of Xian, which is another incredible level. This one is a good deal more challenging somewhat than the monastery but much like it plays all the strengths of the game to its fullest. I do have to dock points off for repeating ice palace's dumb spring boards in a small section but aside from that, I had a great time with it. And yes, it's a really wicked looking level aesthetically, one of the best in the game. This is pretty much the end of peak for TR2, as it's downhill from hill

Floating Islands blow. I want to like them cause of the atmosphere, visuals in the later half and the actually scary enemies, but man. Bottomless pits everywhere and Unfinished Business-tier enemy layout in  the ""golem room""(seriously that segment SUCKED had me wanting out by the end. If Temple of Xian and Monstary embodied the best parts of TR1, this might embody some of the worst aspects. While I I don't dislike it as much as Opera house or Maria Doria, it does take an easy 3rd place. 

Final boss is cool in theory, lara fighting a dragon???? But the actual fight was trash! He's even easier than the big dude from TR1 and it's disappointing that lara never really gets to speak with the guy? I think the dragon should've been phase 2 and a more conventional fire fight + dialogue with the actual villain would've made the fight better but he was like dead by then so I get why they didn't do it. The level itself is just a fight with some more golems and a bunch of McNinja jobbers who weirdly are the easiest human enemies in the game despite being the last ones. As a twist, the game actually ends with a house invasion in Lara's home which is kinda neat but also kinda bizarre. It was alright but still didn't make up for how the final boss ended up.

So overall? TR2 is still an enjoyable if notably more uneven sequel. I liked the risks it took but also felt like it sort of learned the wrong lessons from Tr1 in enemy encounter design(I blame Unfinished Business) for some places as this game's combat isn't it's strong point and doubling down on this big multi enemy encounters just isn't something the game is suited for. I think if I replayed it again I'd like it more the 2nd time but I still feel like the ship levels should've been cut down  some. I can easily say I prefer TR1 to Tr2, but TR2 does have some brilliant levels like Xian and Monastery which are peak TR.

If you compare this pacing to TR1's Lost Valley or Palace Midas the monastery is good or even better but came way too late. TR2 did finish very strong with Xian levels and the expansion is fantastic!

Order of the Blooming Pyre - Part 11 - [Imbricate|Impose|Inculcate],"**“WAAAAAAAG-”** *SPLAT*

The last of the Ork Boyz making up the seventh wave toppled over, a ragged hole in its head as the momentum of its charge was abruptly stopped. Palatine Amira Leioda raised her plasma pistol, still smoking, and spared a glance at her mission. Behind her, a contingent of Sisters manned the ramparts of this position, eyes and ears vigilant for any sign of further incursion attempts.

Amira had picked this ground, a mountain pass roughly eighty-eight kilometers north-east of Shortama, for several reasons. The first was that it was a genuinely defensible area along the main advance of the WAAAGH!!!. Hit and run attacks by more mobile elements of the Pyre had drawn the partial attention of the horde, and brought them to the pass where Amira and her Sisters of the Asura tribe waited. There, they had exploited the Ork drive to seek a fight by executing staggered retreats, slowly drawing them further into the pass and preventing them from using their ramshackle vehicles. Even now she could hear the horde as it mustered itself for another attempt, their brutish voices echoing off the pass’s stone walls.

The second … was that she knew who led this particular horde. One of the so-called “Red Butchers”, a Warboss by the name of Zagrak Redtoof. Amira’s lip curled up into a snarl as she thought of the source of this information, the meeting at Pacificator still fresh. The Pyre’s hatred of the Alpha Legion in particular was not unearned, but these serpents had spoken truth, though not without an agenda riding on that truth’s tail. What said agenda was, however, remained to be seen, for even the whispers of the martyrs had been unclear on the matter.

Regardless, it was actionable intel that the Pyre could act upon, and so they did. By dint of their aptitude for slaughter within a violence-fueled hierarchy, many of these “Red Butchers” had risen to command-equivalent positions. The exact shape of that hierarchy was unclear, and how it interacted with the broader WAAAGH!!! needed to be determined in order to disrupt it. More data was required to build a better threat profile, and see what gave way when nudged.

Thus, the Blooming Pyre, vivisectionists of miracles and breakers of mysteries, had sought to engineer a confrontation by usurping ritual, taking one of the ontological symbols of the Blood God, the number eight, and twisting it for their purposes. Pattern and symbology had meaning, even outside the tides of the Empyrean, when enough will and intent were put behind them. Amira, and eighty-seven other sisters of the Pyre, were holding a pass eighty eight kilometers away from a significant settlement. They had held off waves of eight times eight of the foe, for seven of their attempts, anointing the battleground with spilt blood. The eighth such attempt was not far behind. It was practically a beacon, an echoing shout into the void that was irresistible for any worshiper of the Blood God. Whatever strategic inclination the abomination wearing the skin of an Ork had, it would not be able to ignore such a thing. Its patron would not allow it. Her forward scouts had reported that Bloodtoof had deliberately held back on joining the fight until this wave, sensing an opportunity to gain favor through auspiciously timed bloodshed. And so, the bait was set. Now … came the waiting. Amira allowed herself a moment of reflection, before the time came. *“How things have changed …”*, she thought with a wan smile.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*She had been a Hospitaller of the Argent Seraph, one of significant rank, when the storm came, a combat medic who healed with one hand, and harmed with the other. It had been ironic for her, interacting with the Order of St. Elizabeth for the brief time they had on New Arcadia. She wondered if she had seemed that innocent, when she first swore her vows. Had she always been so caught up in the splendor of Emperor-granted purpose? Unhardened by the necessity of duty and the horrors of war? Uncomprehending of what lurked beyond the veil…*

*As the casualties had begun to mount, the warp storm around the Cyrioc system unceasing, Amira began finding herself on the front lines more and more. She’d gained an affinity for hammers when she’d picked up the maul of a fallen militia-man to defend her charges. A remnant of that first weapon now adorned the thunderhammer in her right hand, the gleaming steel of the decoration on the head contrasting the grey-black stone-like texture of her weapon. The clawed buckler strapped to her left had been a later addition, a re-consecrated lightning claw scavenged from Traitor Astartes raiders, and repurposed to be a tool of both offense and defense. She’d ended up becoming a leader, a point of calm in a storm of sometimes literal insanity. Amira had been one of the few who understood the effect the roiling energies had on them, to use it to give them an edge in surviving the horrors the storm unleashed. Early on, there had been … doubts, about whether or not they could survive without using that edge.*

*Circumstance and attrition had ultimately stolen the choice of using it from them. The funeral pyres, empty weapon magazines, and broken minds that could never be healed presented an argument none could ignore.The survivors gathered the splintered, broken pieces of what they had been before, strong, yet too rigid to bend, and reforged themselves, with will, knowledge, and intent. A sacrifice of what they had been, and an offering of what they could be … an offering that had been observed, and accepted. And so, she and her Sisters had Awakened to the Truth.*

The Palatine was roused from her reflection by the Superior of her Celestian bodyguard. “Palatine Leioda, ma’am. Vanguard reports that the Warboss approaches.” The Palatine nodded. She was never one to waste words.

It didn’t take long for the Red Butcher to make its way up to their position. Amira could smell it in the air. The scent of adrenaline and mold, mixed with an under-scent of fresh blood. This wave, however, was different from the previous ones. There was a remarkable level of discipline in the way these orks marched. The sound of their advance was measured, the synchronized sound of footsteps more in line with a professional army than a mob. There were no battlecries, no shouts of that signature Ork call. As the foe came into view, Amira felt why: ripples in the fabric of reality, radiating outwards from a point further back. Something was subtly guiding these orks, restraining their bloodlust until the time was right. *“How ironic, that they would be more disciplined instead of less…”*, she thought. Then again, that was not exactly a high bar to clear for them. What she did see, however, were Orkoid glyphs marking the designation for “Blood Axes” ork klan, interspersed with red, the color of dried blood. There were other glyphs that almost seemed to pulse, a heartbeat quickening in anticipation for the slaughter ahead.

WIthout warning, the mob surged forward, their leash released. They ran headlong into a wall of boltshells and righteous fury. Amira and her Celestian guard manned the gap, preventing the orks that made it through from threatening their gun emplacements. The Palatine caught the swing of a choppa with her buckler, before ramming the head of her hammer into the torso of the Ork to force it back, then deploying the claws under the protective metal as she drew her fist back and stabbed into the ork’s face. A power-armored push with her foot sent the ork sprawling to the ground, and a measured swing of her hammer ended its struggle. It was instinctive, but controlled, like making an incision, or closing off a wound with sutures.

They had cleared a space beyond the defenses, and her Sisters began moving forward to reinforce. Amira could feel her Sisters were being affected, losing themselves to the battle-joy, and she called out a warning to keep them focused. They needed to stick to the plan, and wanton slaughter would not allow them to carry it out. Her own head was clear, as it always was when the bolt rounds flew and the blades came out. Oh, she knew wrath, ever since the storm, ever since the skies had darkened, and the laughter of thirsting gods had rung in her ears. But these orks were tools. It was mere rote to put them down, like marching a drill or loading boltgun magazines.

[Pict-capture of Zagrak Redtoof, Warboss of Da Red Butchaz](https://preview.redd.it/5b11ctlx7wkc1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d160d6a9b8cc00f4a7b8f4405efc12aef85a62fd)

The real work began when the Red Butcher stepped forward. Zagrak Redtoof was large, even by ork standards, a beast that had glutted itself upon corrupted meat and scraps. Redtoof bore a scavenged chainsword, and more oddly, a plasma pistol that didn’t backfire, speaking to some level of consistent gear maintenance that the rest of its kind seemed to disdain. The rest of the ork Boyz flowed back, the fight ebbing as the Warboss stepped forward toward the Palatine, raising its weapon in a challenge that surmounted every barrier of language, species, and culture. There was another pulse in the fabric of reality, the anointed ground resonating with the symmetry of this engineered ritual. The Sororitas manning the defenses reloaded their weapons and fingered the triggers, but they did not engage. That wasn’t part of the plan, not yet.

“Mine”, Amira told her honor guard, and strode forward. All eyes turned to the two of them.

“I’z da Butcha Redtoof,” the ork thundered, leering down at her. “Foight me and die, ‘umie!”

Amira calmly looked into its abhorrent eyes. “You … are but a sacrifice on *my* altar.”

She had been a Hospitaller once. *And this was her operating table.*

The ork bared its teeth and roared, muscles straining as veins throbbed, its eyes going completely blood red, before lunging forward with a speed that belied its massive size. The whispers of the martyrs surged, and Amira shifted to the side, letting her opponent pass and pivoting to face it. The ork snarled and brought up its chainsword to swing again. The Palatine brought up her buckler to deflect, the claws retracted. It almost wasn’t enough. The chainsword drew blood on her cheek, just below her eye. Whatever blessings this abomination had received, it made it stronger and faster than its kin.

“DIS PLANET IS OURS, ‘UMIE!”, the Ork bellowed, “AND AFTA DAT, DA REST A’ DIS OONIVERSE!”

The ork charged again with its pistol raised, but Amira was done feeling things out. The head of her hammer slammed into the knee joint of the beast, causing it to stagger. Her buckler slammed down on the thing’s wrist, causing it to drop the pistol before it could fire.

She began to chant. **“Through tall grass, come winter sun,”** her voice carried out over the mountain pass.

The ork snarled, forcing itself up. The swings of its chainsword were wild, but fast, almost overwhelmingly so. Amira began to retreat carefully, step by step, waiting … before she took a single step forward and snapped out her buckler in an uppercut. Ork teeth soared into the air as it connected.

**“We stand in our bones, covered in frost,”** she incanted.

Another scream of rage from the ork, its eyes now twin pools of blood. The cadence of her chant was a pace, an exercise the Order taught its Novitiates. It eased them into the understanding of the Order’s traditions. It armed them for the rituals they would eventually undergo. It prepared them for the revelation they would receive. The ork spat out more teeth, but Amira kept circling it, ducking under a retaliatory strike, gripping her weapon with two hands and swinging with the butt end of her hammer into the thing’s gut.

**“Where we were queens, undone by war,”** she sang.

Behind her, eighty seven power armored boots slammed into the ground, a clap of thunder following the hallowed words. The ork swung with a fist, shearing off a part of her armor’s shoulder guard, but she fought through the pain, swinging with an overhand strike into the Ork’s shoulder. The Ork let out a laughing bellow, tossing her away with a sweep of its hand. She landed in a half crouch, hammer radiating heat. If she had wanted to kill the thing, she would have ended it there by going for the head.

**“To behold the world we have lost,”** she intoned.

Eighty seven feet hit the ground in the wake of her words. The remaining orks looked … nervous. Some glanced at the power armored figures on the ramparts, perhaps wondering if this was some sort of shamanistic curse. This wasn’t how things were supposed to go. They weren’t the ones that were supposed to be getting krumped. It was time to finish this. Amira had made her final assessment of her opponent, and had adapted to its movements. Now, it was time to let the pieces fall into place. For the first time, she went on the offensive, pressuring the side of the ork’s injured sword arm, weaving her way around the chainsword strike before bringing her hammer down. There was an audible crack, and a burning sizzle, as the elbow, upper arm, and shoulder joint broke simultaneously.

**“Warmth fades, glory cannot linger,”** she spoke.

This time, there was nothing but silence. Her power armored foot swept the other leg, and the ork was brought down to its knees. It tried to open its mouth, but Amira had indulged it enough. Her hammer began to blaze, fire coating the head of the weapon. She swung it in an overhead arc once more. Like a judge’s gavel, the hammer’s descent heralded finality, a decisive end. It delivered on its promise with a thunderous report.

**“All we have left is the** ***pyre***.“ She finished, feeling the flame of her soul settle.

Amira turned to the remaining orks. They stood there, stunned, disoriented both by the spectacle they had witnessed, as well as the loss of the influence upon them. On their faces was awe … and *fear*. The Palatine raised her weapon, and drove the butt into the ground, sounding a metallic peal that rung across the pass. She had ended the Butcher on an killing ground aspected to the Blood God … *without spilling the opposing champion’s blood*.

“Now show them the light.”

The defense line erupted in response as bolt weapons, now loaded with inferno bolt shells, tore into the remaining orks, the incendiary ammunition igniting the xenos. Flamers bathed the ground once soaked with the blood of sacrifices in promethium, scouring the offering and ritual space. They had built a site of power, only to desecrate it so thoroughly the backlash rippled through reality. They had taken the power of their enemy, and upended it, usurped it.

*Corrupted* it.

Amira watched the flames rise for a moment, basking in the glow, before turning to depart with her mission. The Sisters could not hold this position, not with the main advance of the orks barreling past them. They had struck a blow here, and soon, they would have the opportunity to strike another.

But in the meantime … they had work to do elsewhere.",1b0czyh,9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/war_for_Gryllus/comments/1b0czyh/order_of_the_blooming_pyre_part_11/,"[""(loved the read.

Massive input delay on controller/less aim assist changing every day and only works sometimes.,"Im not sure what the goal if this post is, whether its to spread what i think is an issue needing to be fixed in order to make more people aware and or to find others who are also having this problem.

Ive been Talking about this issue on the ea forums since December now and its been affecting me at most since season 14. Originally i would refer to this as my aim assist. It would just randomly feel stronger or weaker on different days. my original theory was that apex was too sensitive to controllers deadzone. like with a brand new controller on apex, if you have no deadzone on you'll still experience stick drift even if you have a new battlebeaver controller with 40% more stick tension, no matter what you will still have stick drift. versus other games like the finals for example. with a brand new controller and your deadzone set to 0 you won't experience any stick drift because the controllers new and should be fine.

A dev did respond to me stating

\- I agree that ""Look Deadzone"" to ""none"" tend to drift, even on new controllers. I'll see what I can do for that.

the problem with the theory of this issue being about stick drift is that it is true that Deadzone on your controller changes every day getting worse on your controller as it ages. however if that was the case i would think apex would only feel worse as your controller ages but it doesn't. as your controller gets older it goes from feeling fine on some days or even extremely good like you have aimbot vs on other days where you could barely kill a bronze player. Only in this game though, so i no longer think dead zone is the cause of this due to the fact the deadzone only gets worse at a linear rate. Personally, my skill level doesn't rise or decrease at a linear rate though, its constantly dipping up and down due to what i think is a bug.

[Solved: Aim assist is broken. Only works sometimes. - Page 68 - Answer HQ (ea.com)](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/Aim-assist-is-broken-Only-works-sometimes/td-p/12552488/page/68)

This is the forum topic that I've been posting in since December.

Ive posted clip comparisons when apex has either had less aim assist/high input lag on different days and on different guns on post  Post #548 post # 603  post # 612  post # 622  post # 623  post # 654  post # 655  post # 656

I posted a clip showing that high ping is not the cause of this bug on post # 658

It wasnt until post # 671 In which i showcased this vido

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_BWrM-nelPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BWrM-nelPo)

on post # 680  i also showcased that it changes between DX11 and DX12

after i made the discovery that the game for me is changing between different fps and different version i started to think that it wasn't aim assist and instead it was massive amounts of input lag.

Similarly, there was a bug i remember back in season 1-4 maybe in which 240 fps would cause massive input lag so people would have to cap it to 190 fps. Of course, they fixed that and this bug is a little different. At first when i discovered this, 60fps had largely faster input response times than 240fps until i realized that on those days that 240fps actually feels good are days that 60fps feel bad. So 60fps is no exception to this bug in that it also gets high input lag. This would make sense as to why console players also get this bug. High input lag is affecting all fps and changing between different amounts. Some days ive tried 240fps, 150fps, 60fps and they've felt good versus other days they have all felt bad. Ive tried 240, 190, 180, 150, 144, 120, 95 ,85, 75, and 60. It feels different on all fps and changes everyday on all fps.

I think this name was given by the user BULLETTRAINZ but he referred to it has pendulum aim in which the game act as if there was a delayed amount of resistance as the enemy is moving and your aim would swing back and forth around the enemy like a pendulum clock.

One thing I don't understand about this bug is that it seems to not be affecting everyone Aswell as it is changing every day.

This isn't something like you changing your reticle color or sitting up instead of slouching and you feel like you're playing a little better. The difference is too drastic, days where you have high input lag/less aim assist it feels impossible to do what you could on days where the game feels responsive and your aa acts as intended. It feels like as soon as you wake up and get on the game. The game decides your fate and you will know exactly how you perform for the rest of the day. Very few times has it changed in the middle of the day. I'm not going to say it doesn't change in the middle of the day because for me it has but not often.

I have yet to figure out if this is also affecting mnk Aswell though, i hope to find more people who may not be sure if they are also having this problem.

I also recently did a clean wipe of my pc, reinstalling windows. The problem still persists.

HOW TO HAVE A BALANCED WEAPON SANDBOX using MW19/WZ1 for reference (long post),"A little message to the devs on how to have a game with balanced and diverse weapons each with a place and playstyle in mind. (Pre battlepasses)

Skipping any secondaries. And some weapons are clearly for multiplayer and arent balanced for WZ.

Lets start with SMGs as they're the most popular class.

MP5
 Strongest SMG under 10 meters but with high recoil and steep damage drop off. Great for rushing players and dominating building interiors but poor for fighting ranged pitched fights 

MP7
 High fire rate but low damage per shot with easy to control recoil. Great support weapon for aggressive snipers or ranged LMG players. Suitable for clearing interiors but better for tactical players.

 AUG(9mm)
 Very high damage with low recoil but small magazine size. Great solo option that holds up against the other options. Great stealth option for players who like to play slow and precise.

 P90
 High base magazine with moderate recoil, high fire rate and fast ADS. Another good support weapon to pair with an aggressive sniper or LMG.  

 PP19 Bizon.
 Largest magazine size and fastest ADS in category. Low damage but surprisingly good mobility. Good for players who might not be the most accurate. Or ironically also good for players with good aim and tracking. Although low damage does make this a very niche gun.

 UZI(9mm) 
 Best hip fire accuracy in class, low recoil and good damage range. Great jack of all trades weapon. Isnt the best at anything but strong enough to compete in most scenarios.

Onto ARs.

Kilo 141
 Low recoil, moderate damage. Very versatile weapon like the Uzi its not the best at anything but strong enough all round to compete. Weak at closer ranges but fantastic at mid to long ranges.

FAL.
 Token tap fire weapon. Then the most OP weapon then back to being the token tap fire gun. Always been a strong option if you have good aim and a good trigger finger. High damage with moderate recoil.

 M4A1
 Definition of a jack of all trades weapons. Arguably the most reliable weapon on this list. Fast fire rate. Moderate recoil with an easy recoil pattern. Can be built to do anything and fill any role.

 FR.556
 Token burst gun. Kinda shit.

 Oden 
 Very high damage, very slow rate of fire and high recoil. A potential monster if you have the recoil control. Very slow mobility best used when already posted up. Can dominate the mid ranges in the hand of the player.

M13
 Best recoil in category, potentially in game. Very low damage per shot bit very fast rate of fire. If you have good aim and tracking this weapon will be your best friend. Although low potential damage per mag makes it weaker when fighting multiple players.

FN Scar 
 Another high Damage but high Recoil rifle. Hits hard but has slower than average mobility and isnt the easiest to control at range. Powerful weapon and a good heavy hitter with a decent rate of fire.

 AK 47
Most approachable of the higher recoil higher damage weapons. Pretty versatile in the close to mid ranges. Can be built for range if you're prepared to sacrifice mobility, can be built as a close range beast with the ammo conversion.

AUG (5.56)
 Pretty solid AR, faster fire rate, higher damage and more recoil than the M4 or Kilo but damage compensates for it. Great sniper support for ranged sniper players. 

Marksman/Snipers.

EBR 
 Think FAL but heavier, harder hitting and a slightly slower fire rate.

KAR98k
 Made for quick scoping. Great ADS, heavy bullet drop and low damage for non headshots.

 MK2 Carbine
 Meme gun in WZ. 

 AX 50
 Heavier than the Kar with less bullet drop and more damage

Dragunov
 Token Dragunov.

 HDR 
 Heaviest sniper, slowest ADS but least drop and most damage.

LMGs (kinda hard really only 1 stood out)
 
M91
 Good fire rate, reasonable recoil control with a low damage per shot. Pretty run of the mil LMG.

MG34
 Fastest fire rate and TTK in category but low magazine size (for its RoF) and slow reload. Fantastic for holding a building once you're posted up but rather impractical for most scenarios.

PKM
 Hard to compare the other LMGs against the PKM. Good damage, low recoil, fast enough rate of fire but not fast enough to burn through the ammo to fast. Most practical of the category.

 

We used to have a wide and diverse list of weapons, with different options suiting different playstyles. You like to play aggressive and push everyone, MP5 and Kar. Play slow and carefully? Maybe a P90 and AX 50 be a good pair. Maybe you play range and the M13 and HDR would be best for you. 

After the CW intergration the dynamic changed. Now weapons, usually the new battlepass weapons are best in their category in almost every regard. 

Using WZ3 for reference we have maybe 4 or 5 guns worth using unless you want to be outgunned. HRM and Ram 9 make all the other SMGs redundant, and the Ram 7 still seems to be the standout option for automatic ranged weapons. 

Want to play a rush build? Use the Ram 7 and Ram 9. Want to play ranged? Ram 7 and Ram 9 Play support? Ram 7 and HRM. Those 4 or 5 guns filll every niché and cover all your bases. 

Yes the internet has its influence, a few people will copy the Streamers and everyone else will copy them because if you only lose to 1 gun you'd be silly not to use it too.

I look at my own loadouts, and be said im not as good at this version than the previous 2 so stick to easy weapons, but the HRM is in 6 of my classes. Where as in WZ1 i had 10 very different and distinct classes all with a purpose. Well maybe 8 and a High Alert and ghost class in there too.

I don't know how much of Wz1 you played, including BOPs and VG integration, but guns like the Grau, Amax, Diamatti, DMR, Fara83, Automaton, FFAR, Oden and **more**, all had their own time to shine and ruled the lobbies for weeks on end until a patch nerfed them to oblivion. \n\nBetween Wz1/2, Wz2 got it right **after** the hemlock nerf. Then you could use practically anything. And they were pretty consistent with it - new guns didn't completely dominate and you had a litany of guns that were in rotation. What you mention about your loadouts, I **always** had multiple varying loadouts made in Wz2, but not Wz1 (besides the snipers: kar98/spr/swiss31). \n\nWz3 remains to be seen - in my experience it's somewhere in between Wz1/2, but closer to being balanced like 2. Smgs: HRM9, RAM9, AMR9 are all viable and popular. ARs leave something to be desired (I believe the SVA is the only gun worth using rn), but seeing so many MTZ-762s and Pulems, plus the stalker being 1 shot/katt, the game's in a decent place.""]"

**Modules De-activated issues...**

It works like this

When   you start DCS, your PC has to connect to ED's master server to request   permission to run the software you spent your hard earned coin on.

IF   either you cannot connect to master server OR master server has yet   again fallen on it ass ... then you cannot play the software you rented

It   was pointed out at the time by myself and many others a system  designed  with a single point of failure .... was a stupidly bad idea  and would  cause legit customers issues ........ which is what happens

For some reason master server seems to be falling over regularly ...... especially on patch days.

**Standalone DCS version is better to use:**

You have access a two week FREE trial on some modules and Maps

You   can buy stuff direct from Eagle Dynamics, ED get more money AND you  get  bonus points (miles) to earn a discount later on when buying stuff

\~\~You get a 50% discount on your first purchase from Eagle Dynamics (standalone)\~\~

You can buy stuff on steam and transfer it to standalone

You cannot buy stuff from ED and transfer it to steam

You can control better which build of DCS you fly with using standalone

Steam and standalone can play together in MP (as long as they are using the same build version eg release or openbeta)

House of Whispers: Part Four,"When he happened to drive by Millie Beauford’s old house and saw new people moving in, Bill Harper knew it was going to be a bad day. “Aw, shit,” he muttered to himself as he slowed his squad car to a crawl. A man with sandy hair and glasses pushed a mower through the tangled front lawn and a girl with glasses helped a woman wearing a white blouse pull weeds from beside the foundation. Another man, shaved head and wearing a gray tank top and camo cargo shorts, carried boxes from a big U-Haul and sat them on the porch, where a giant pile of crap had accumulated: Tables, chairs, a reading lamp, and bulging plastic totes covered in Sharpie - KITCHEN, LIVING ROOM, BEDROOM. 

Something cold and slick turned over in Bill’s stomach, and the taste of bile suddenly coated the back of his throat. 

Spinning the wheel, Bill swung down Ridgecrest, which fringed the yard, and craned his neck to see better. The CB on the dash squawked but he ignored it. Damn thing could wait. 

Aside from the two men, the woman, and the girl, there didn’t seem to be anyone else. He let up on the gas even more and came to a rolling stop, one hand tightening on the wheel and the other lying on top of his considerable thigh, fingers drumming an edgy tempo. The man with the glasses reached the chain link fence separating the yard from the sidewalk and turned the mower around. He looked up, and their eyes met. Even esconded in his cruiser, even wearing the gun and golden badge that imbued him with endless power and commanded the respect and deference of everyone he met, Bill, all two-hundred-fifty pounds of him, felt naked. 

Exposed.

He whipped his eyes away and accidentally laid on the gas; the car surged forward with a squeal of tires and the belt locked hard across his chest, squeezing a gasp from his lungs like toothpaste from a tube. He stampled the brake and slammed back against the seat. The man behind the mower watched him bemusedly, and Bill sighed. After all that, he’d better get out and say something or else it’d look strange. 

Damn it. 

Stupid goddamn house. He was a grown man who could handle anything, *anything*...except for 625 Chestnut Street. Just *looking* at it made his heart beat faster, and whenever he drove by, he had the uncanny feeling of being watched, as though the *thing* inside were staring out at him, seeing through joists, plaster, metal, and years. 

That was stupid, he told himself, but he felt it anyway. He went out of his way to avoid that house - if he needed to get to the other side of town, he took every other street he could, even if it turned a five minute jaunt into a fifteen minute trek. When he *did* pass it, he kept his eyes straight ahead and his mind firmly on other matters - taxes, reports, what Amanda was making for dinner that night, his son Zeke’s grades (they were good...a little *too* good). Even then, a shiver never failed to shimmy down his spine. 

All the kids said it was haunted, and they weren’t far off. 

They weren’t far off at all.

Why the hell were people moving in anyway? Last he heard, Bobby Beaufort, who took it over after his mom died, was having trouble finding a buyer. 

Bill went to school with Bobby, and for a time, they were good friends. Then something happened and their relationship went out the window. Most people born and raised in Rossville tended to stay in Rossville - law of averages or some damn thing. Bobby, though...Bobby left right out of high school, packed his old Honda up and let out that very day. Bill saw him heading out of town.

It looked like he was fleeing.

Three years ago, Bobby’s mother, Millie - sweet old lady who always handed out full sized chocolate bars at Halloween - fell down the basement stairs and lay there for three days, moaning and crying weakly out for help, before the neighbor found her. Bill was the first one on the scene, and even if he lived to be a thousand, he’d never forget her face: Contorted in misery, mouth open and drooping, eyes cloudy white. She talked out of her head before the ambulance got there, said something pushed her...told him it talked to her at night.

Told him it mentioned his name.

Horror came over him like a splash of cold water and he almost ran out screaming his head off. Later on, he got a hold of himself. She was dehydrated, concussed, and senile to begin with, she was just rambling.

Just rambling.

Every so often, though, as he lay next to Amanda and struggled to shut his mind down to sleep, he wondered if he was wrong. What if Millie Beaufort was telling the truth? What if there really was something in that house? What if it pushed her down those stairs just to lure him inside?

Right now, in broad daylight, the sheriff of Rossville shuddered.

After Millie died in the hospital three days later, Bobby came back to town from Florida, where he owned a construction company. He didn’t stay long and didn’t talk to anyone. Andy Miller said he saw him down to the Save-a-Lot, and when Bobby saw him, he went pale, turned around, and rushed off. 

The house wasn’t likely something Bobby wanted to deal with and it showed in how long it sat empty. Bill was just starting to think it was going to stay that way...now this.

He should have gone in there when he had the chance. Here should have gone in and taken that damn...thing...out. He committed a few times, but he always found an excuse for backing out. As much as he might say he didn’t believe in ghosts, all he had to do was think of Millie Beaufort lying at the foot of those stairs soaked in her own piss and shit, raving about spirits whispering his name, and…

He shuddered.

Inhaling through his nose, Bill looked up at the house. In the light of day, it was entirely unremarkable, like a dozen other houses in town. Wood siding, half rounds trimming the second floor exterior, green roof, white trim gone gray with grime. Not so scary, is it?

No, it wasn’t.

The thing inside, though…

Bill quashed that thought with the ruthlessness of a communist dictator putting down a rebellion. 

In the yard, the man with the glasses pushed the mower aside, his eyes never wavering from the car, as though it were a venomous bug that would bite the moment he looked away. The one with the shaved head carried a box up the porch steps, sat it next to another, and returned to the truck, completely oblivious to Bill’s presence. 

Goosebumps raked Bill’s arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up. The sensation of being watched crept through him. *Drive away...just forget it and drive away. You’re the law, who cares what they think? Just get away.* 

Bill was a lot of things, and stubborn was one of them; he’d be damned if he let himself get so spooked over a house that he ran away. For that reason, and that reason only, he threw off his belt, flung the door open, and got out. 

The perfume of mangled grass seasoned the still air, and blazing hot sunshine enveloped Bill like the fires of hell. He slammed the door, hitched his belt up, and walked slowly around the side of the car, approaching the fence. The man in glasses came over to meet him, and the woman and the little girl, kneeling next to each other, turned their heads to watch, a look of mistrust crossing the mother’s face.

What the hell was he gonna say? Welcome to Rossville, folks?

That’s when he caught it. 

The U-Haul.

On the other side of the fence, the man stopped, his forehead knitting in confusion. His blue eyes flickered with trepidation, and Bill focused on that and not the malignant house behind him, leering forth like a goddamn pedophile. “Afternoon,” Bill said with a curt nod.  

“Good afternoon, officer,” the man said cautiously. “Can I help you?”

The other man stood by the U-Haul’s tailgate, watching the proceeding like a spectator to an Old West gunfight. Bill’s eyes darted to him, then the house, then back to Glasses. “Your moving truck’s blocking the street,” he said in his best cordial tone, “can I get you to move it, please?”

Glasses shot a quick glance over his shoulder as if to confirm the truck was, indeed, blocking the street. “It’s almost empty,” the other man called. “Two more minutes.”

Bill didn’t care whether the truck was blocking Alley Lane or not, but being here, next to this house and in front of these people, he was uncharacteristically tense - backing down *too* easily might look suspicious. “I understand there ain’t much room,” he said, “I just want other folks to get back if they have to.”

Glasses turned and surveyed the lot, and Bill leaned over the fence. “Just...cut it a little to the left.”

The other man, having heard, disappeared, and a second later, the U-Haul’s engine roared into life. 

While he maneuvered the truck out of the way, Bill looked up at the house again. Curtains fluttered in a second story window, and his stomach turned. Just a draft. That was all. “Just moving in?” he asked to make conversation. 

“Yes,” the man said. The woman and little girl were coming over, and Bill sneaked a glance at them from the corner of his eye. He’d never seen either one of them before, he was sure of it, but the girl was oddly familiar. “I’m Tom Harriman, this is my wife Julia, and our daughter Meagan.”

The woman offered a guarded smile, and Bill gave her a nod as curt as the first. Twelve at a glance, Meagan was short and petite, her bare arms slender and her knees knobby. She wore a floral print dress, big glasses, and her hair in a ponytail. Deja vu swept Bill, and a puzzled frown touched the corners of his lips.. 

“I’m Sheriff Harper,” Bill said, “and it’s nice to meet you folks.” He paused and tried to think of something more to say. Normally, he was at ease with anyone he met, even if they were a hardened criminal who’d shiv his guts out just as soon as look at him, but right now, he was antsy. He shifted his bulk from one foot to the other and crossed his arms over his chest, then put his hands on his hips. 

“You too,” Tom said. “I’m really sorry about blocking the street.”

The U-Haul rolled forward, swung to the right, then backed up, the tail lights blinking. It went forward again, turned even more, then came back a second time.

“Like I said, there isn’t much room,” Bill said, “the streets around here weren’t made for trucks that big even though sometimes you need ‘em.” 

The engine shut off, and the man jumped out. The front end still jutted out a couple of feet into the road, but it was good enough for Bill. “That should do it,” Bill said, “it was nice meeting y’all.”

“You too, Sheriff,” Tom said. 

Nodding one final nod, Bill turned around, went back to his car, and slid in behind the wheel. The feeling of being watched was stronger now, and his heart throbbed like an abscessed tooth. He had the strongest urge to look in the rearview mirror, but resisted: If he saw something staring out of that second floor window, he’d keel over dead.

WIthout putting on his seatbelt, Bill started the car, put it in drive, and pulled away from the fence. He didn’t realize he was holding his breath until his lungs began to ache two blocks later. He let it out in a shaky rush and licked his lips.

Alright, well, 625 isn’t empty anymore. That put him in the hot seat. Again. What now? 

First order of business was seeing Joey VanderMeer. After that, maybe the others too: Andy Miller, Frank Stone, and Dave Caswell. Frank was the principal of the junior high and Andy worked the graveyard shift at the Tyson plant in Harrisonburg. He could catch them any old time he wanted, but not Dave; he drove big rigs up and down the east coast and stayed gone sometimes for weeks on end. He’d have to stop by Helen Myers’ boarding house and see if he was in. 

A voice crackled over the CB, bringing him out of his fugue. “Bill, you there?” 

Terry Bradford, Rossville’s sole dispatcher. A tall, lanky woman with short black hair, she comprised a good 40 percent of the town police department, with Bill and his deputies Chuck and Mark rounding out the rest. 

Grabbing the handset from its cradle, Bill depressed the TALK button on the side and lifted it to his mouth. “Yeah, go ‘head.”

“Got a call from Edith Johnson,” Terry said, her long-suffering inflection thinly veiled, “she says someone sprayed painted something on her garage.”

Every small town, Bill reckoned, had at least one resident old biddy who lived in her window looking for reasons to phone the police. Edith Johnson was Rossville’s and had been for going on twenty years. Seventy-eight and frail with bushy brown hair that refused to go gray even as her face withered, Edith was the bane of Bill’s existence. She called the station at least once a day complaining about cars going too fast on her street (*it’s a twenty-five and that Tundra was going at least thirty)*; teenagers walking past (*they’re up to no good, I just know it*); one time, she even called on the birds in her bushes outside for making too much noise *(I don’t know animal control’s number, so I’m calling you)*. Bill tried to be patient with her - her husband died ten years back and her adult children never visited, so she was lonely, and her arthritic knees kept her from being able to move around. Some days, however, he could hit her. 

“Alright,” he said into the CB, “I’ll take a look.”

Five minutes later, he pulled into the driveway of Edith Johnson’s one story ranch on Rosedale Street. Potted plants crowded the front porch and a line of pink plastic flamingos marched across the front lawn, presided over by a gazing ball on a faux marble pedestal. A flower bed edged the house; a gnome with ruddy cheeks favored Bill with a knowing smirk that made him inexplicably uneasy. Edith, clad in a pink button up blouse and white pants, was already making her way toward him as he got out, her posture stooped and her steps shuffling. Brown age spots dotted her skeletal arms, lending her the appearance of an overripe banana, and Bill could smell the Aspercreme before she was even upon him. 

“He defaced my garage,” she said in low, trembling outrage. 

Bill glanced at the big roll top door fronting the detached garage.

Nothing.

“Who did?” he asked.

“That Miller boy,” she spat.

Ah.

Cody Miller. Andy’s son.

If every little town has an Edith, it has a Cody too, a guy (or gal) who always takes the blame when something goes wrong. Bill wouldn’t lie, Cody was a little...different, but to the best of his knowledge, he’d never actually done anything to anyone. People had a way of scapegoating him that...well...wasn’t very fair. See, his old man was, to put it nicely, a piece of shit: He drank, smacked his wife around, and was responsible for almost every bad thing to happen in Rossville during his youth. Someone egged your windows? Andy Miller. Someone broke into your house and stole fifty dollars from your sock drawer? Andy Miller. Someone did doughtns in your front yard? Guess who. 

In high school, he, Bill, Joey, and the others would cruise around, drink beer, and chase girls - boys will be boys. Only for Andy, seventeen never ended. Bill got serious about life, Dave got serious, even Joey, to an extent, but not Andy. Instead, he got serious about booze. In the fifteen years since school last let out, he’d been arrested two dozen times for DUI, driving on a suspended, domestic battery, possession of coke, possession of pot, speeding, reckless driving. He was a man with a family and a steady job, but in a way, he was still that wild teeanger, only more bitter and hateful.

Or something. Bill wasn’t a psychologist. Andy was bad news and that was that. Unfortunately, that reputation rubbed off on Cody. The adults were leery of him and no doubt told their kids he was a bad seed, and the kids picked on him because kids are like a school of piranha: They move as a pack and descend on the odd man out. It didn’t help that Cody looked like he was always plotting a murder: Dark, stormy eyes, strained frown. That was likely on account of everyone mistreating hm, which made Bill feel bad for him...but those are the types you gotta watch. The most popular and well-adjusted kids - like his own boy Zeke - aren’t the ones shooting up schools, it’s the bullied ones like Cody.

“How do you know it was Cody Miller?” Bill asked now.

Edith Johnson’s eyes narrowed to reptilian slits. “Right before I called, he walked by. I was standing on the porch and he didn’t even look at me. Like he was guilty of something.”

“That doesn’t mean he *is*,” Bill said.

“It does in my book,” she said in a tone that closed the matter. 

Bill sighed. When she made up her mind, nothing could shake her. You’d have better luck changing a Democrat’s politics or an evangelical’s religion. “Where is it?” he asked. 

“Follow me.”

She led him around the side of the garage. A chain link fence divided her yard from the neighbor’s, and the unshorn grass reached nearly to Bill’s knees. “There,” she said indignantly.

FUCK YOU, OLD BITCH was splayed across the shabby vinyal siding in white. Bill put his hands on his hips and prodded the inside of his bottom lip with his tongue. Well, *someone* indeed spray painted Edith Johnson’s garage. 

But who?

She swore it was Cody Miller, but her evidence was tenuous at best. Bill was inclined to think it wasn’t him, but he couldn’t rule it out. 

“What are you going to do?” Edith demanded. 

Not much of anything, Bill silently decided. “Well, I’ll talk to him, that’s really all I *can* do.”

“Are you going to arrest him?” she pushed.

Bill was beginning to lose his patience. “If I find probable cause, yes. If not, it’s your word against his.”

“Well, my word counts for more.’

No, actually, it didn’t. Her word meant crap to him. In fact, with the way she was always bothering him, she almost deserved this. Cry wolf long enough, a wolf’s gonna show up, and you’ll have no one to blame but yourself. 

“I’ll talk to him,” he repeated and started back to the car. She followed at a gait, bitching the whole way.

“Are you just going to leave it there?” she asked disbelievingly. 

Bill was behind the wheel with the window down, the key in the ignition. He had half a mind to gun the engine and speed off. What did she think he was, a cleaning service? “I’ll send Mark out to do it,” he said. Mark, the junior most man on the force, could use a good punishment; he came in late too much for Bill’s liking, and this was easier than writing him up. 

“At least you’ll do *that*,” she sniffed.

Bill bit his tongue. “You have a nice day, Mrs. Johnson.”

Backing into the street, he turned right and put Edith Johnson behind him.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Slanek, Venlil Space Corps***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: August 21, 2136*

The patrol ship drifted along the Federation border, dispelling fuel into the endless night. A brooding Marcel sat at the helm, under my supervision. Even with their miraculous abilities, human pilots had no real-world experience flying ships. Perhaps it was unfair to hurl them into the war out of desperation, as unprepared as they were.

I couldn’t stop thinking about Marcel’s reaction to the experiments. First, they recorded him eating sugary snacks and playing games to establish a baseline for pleasure. A variety of other metrics were assessed for comparison, including boredom and anger. I recalled Ilja’s surprise when Marcel’s skin changed to match the readings on the brain scan. Then Marcel was shown videos of the Arxur torturing our children. 

In my interactions with Marcel, he always displayed more than one color. A base tone would reflect his primary mood while secondary emotions shifted in patterns over it, the colors gently fading into each other as his emotional state changed. There was nothing gentle about the deep crimson rage that covered his whole body, quickly giving way to green disgust. He strobed between red and green for the whole video, tense against his restraints. As soon as the test was over he turned bright orange, bolting from the lab in a sweat-soaked stupor. 

It hurt more than I expected to see my friend in such deep distress. At least there would be no doubts about whether Marcel could feel empathy. In his absence, Ilja shared a cumulative AI analysis of all human subjects. The restraints appeared to be unnecessary; they all reacted like Marcel. We had proof that humans *felt* empathy. 

My gaze flickered over to Marcel, curiosity brimming in my chest. The human was evidently lost in thought as well. Red and green danced across his face, as he cast a smoldering stare at the floor panels. Those Arxur clips really left an impression on him. Perhaps he needed something else to think about. 

“If I may ask— what frightened you about our scientists?” I blurted out. “Did you really think they would hurt you? We don’t have the same disposition as you.”

Marcel’s colors faded slightly in intensity. “You’re going to laugh but…most of our old myths about aliens…um…”

“Yes?”

“Well, they involve us getting abducted and experimented on. Hey, for all I knew, you were testing how humans react to torture.”

“You think we’re that barbaric?! Our scientists just want to help you fit in. We need conclusive evidence of your empathetic capacity. Else, we’ll never silence the doubters.”

“I read Quanta’s dossier on your society. You torch animals alive. Seems pretty barbaric to me.”

“What? Are you talking about exterminators? That’s different! They’re protectors, like your Heroes. They don’t kill innocent creatures, just dangerous… predators…” my voice trailed off as Marcel side-eyed me. “Okay, I see your point. But those were doctors, not exterminators. They wouldn’t have hurt you. And the exterminators won’t bother you either, once they realize you aren’t a threat.”

“I don’t see why we needed to prove, yet again, that we’re not the Arxur. Humans haven’t done anything to you.”

“You’re a contradiction of hundreds of years of scientific thought, Marc. Not to mention, certain groups in the Federation won’t like you, much more than us. They’ll demand proof, and I’m not sure even the finest scientific rigor will withstand their scrutiny. It’s not fair. I know.”

The human was silent, directing an intense glare at the scanner feed. The red wasn’t fading, which made me nervous. If we needed to abandon the patrol and return to base, I’d like to know sooner rather than later. Before he endangered himself, or others.

“Are you alright?” I patted the human on the shoulder, and felt him stiffen beneath my paw. “I know that footage disturbed you…and I’m sorry.”

Marcel sighed. “No, I’m sorry. My anger’s not directed at you. I want to wring my hands around an Arxur’s neck.”

“I don’t see how that would improve anything.”

“At least I’d be doing something.”

“You’re here. You’re protecting us.”

“Yes. Someone has to put a stop to their reign of terror. There’s been no issue recruiting people back on Earth. I’m pretty sure every Pro Hero would join the war effort if they could. The way the grays get off on tormenting children, it sickens us. Why are they like that?”

“I wanted to ask you that, Marc. We believed that predators evolve through warfare. Killing and cruelty—isn’t it a survival advantage to you?”

“Well…killing, yes. Killing the competition, or the dangerous things that lurk in the night, but it’s not like we’re the only ones. Your farmers deal with pests that eat crops right?”

“Yes?”

“Do they use pesticides to kill them?”

“They do, but it’s generally frowned upon, since killing so many animals is considered predatory.”

“The point is, you kill your competition with pesticides and kill the dangerous ones with fire. So either killing isn’t just a predatory thing, or you guys are predators too.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that. Before I could gather my thoughts, shrill alarms blared from the ship’s computer. Nine indicators popped up on the scanner feed, suggesting inbound Arxur bombers. The flurry of activity, when the humans arrived, must have piqued their interest. The reptilians loved to target weak links, and an isolated station such as our lodging was just that.

I switched on the comms link. “Prime Outpost, we’re reading nine Arxur bombers en route. Figure they have you as their target.”

A moment of silence passed before the response. “This is General Kam from Venlil Command, we copy you. I’ll ask the humans to position their so-called ‘fighters’ on an intercept course, while we evacuate personnel here. Stall for time if you can.”

“Geez Kam, have a little faith in us,” another voice said, “You’re right, though. Quanta here, do what he said. Don’t risk yourselves too much; we can’t rescue you if you blow up.”

I drew a shaky breath. “Yes, sir, ma’am. We’ll do our best.”

Nausea swelled in my throat, as I synced the ship computer with the disruptor beacons lining the border. My mind strayed to its usual dark corner: replaying my brother’s funeral. The shock was still as fresh as it was months ago, when I first learned that his transport ship was gunned down. There wasn’t a trace left to remember him by; no body to recover.

Would I be the next to fall by the Arxur’s claws?

I hoped the wordless Marcel was okay with the peril we were in. He had loved ones back on Earth, including a fiancé whom he spoke of with fondness. He didn’t want to die here. There was no data on how the primates behaved in life-threatening situations, or how they coped with stress.

But with the grays closing in on our position, there was no time to explain our standard procedure. We thought there’d be time for our allies to settle in, before hurling them into the fire. Hopefully, humans had solid self-preservation instincts, and could use their cleverness to fill in the blanks. Those bombers were about to become quite real.

Watching their angular ships spring forth from nothingness would be a magical sight, if the stakes weren’t so dire. The bombers slowed to regain their bearings, and to scope out their surroundings. They wished to exact revenge on the prey animal who dared to fight back.

“Hideous ships, huh?” I quipped.

There was no reply from Marcel. In my panic, I hadn’t noticed his skin change. He wasn’t purple with fear, as I’d expected. He was red with anger, the same shade of anger that he’d displayed in the lab. Every creature handled stress differently, but his behavior was off by a long shot. An uneasy feeling crept into my mind.

*C’mon Slanek. The grays are the threat here*, I scolded myself. *Not the human.*

“Knock knock. Anyone home?” I tried to keep my voice playful, but I was desperate to snap the human out of his trance. “You do see their ships, and realize we’re alone? There is safety in numbers. It’s time to head back to base.”

Marcel leaned forward, fangs protruding in a menacing snarl. I noted with abject horror how his eyes dilated, and his canines glistened with saliva. So this was what actual human teeth-baring looked like. 

“Marc, we need to flee. Now.” I shook the human on the shoulder, but he shrugged me off. “Marc? Shit man, they definitely s-spotted us. MARCEL!! Floor it… I beg you.”

“EAT THIS MOTHERFUCKERS!” Marcel roared, disregarding me entirely.

The human did floor it: to charge in the direction of the Arxur fleet. What happened?! He went berserk; he was so lucid minutes ago!

I tried to scream a plea to stop, but it came out as an incoherent yelp. The predator either didn’t know how, or didn’t bother to prime the targeting system. He jammed a clawless finger on the firing trigger, spraying plasma rounds with impunity. The glaring aggression seemed to take the grays by surprise; it marked a drastic shift from a Venlil’s typical flightiness.

A few glancing blows struck the lead ship, jolting its pitch. Marcel turned the stream of fire toward the others. Some hits connected at random, though the Arxur seemed more pissed off than wounded. We made a swooping pass across the formation, before banking heavily in the direction from which we came. The computer warned me that we had been target-locked by all nine hostiles.

“Run?” I whimpered.

Marcel cleared his throat, finally showing purple, but not enough in my opinion. “Yep. Good idea.”

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Governor Tarva of the Venlil Republic***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: August 21, 2136*

After responding to the transmission, Kam made an announcement to the station, calling for the fighters to be sent out and for everyone else to evacuate as soon as possible. Roswell spoke up as soon as he finished. “You done, General?” 

“Done? Of course I’m not done! The station is under attack!”

“I know. You and Tarva need to get off this station right now. Come on, I’ll take you back to Venlil Prime.” The mutant human reached for my paw. 

“No, I’m n-not running away,” I stammered through my fear, “I refuse to abandon you to your deaths against those m-monsters.”

Roswell looked ready to warp us out anyway, but Catherine stopped him. “Let them stay, Kenny. It’s not like we’re planning on letting the Arxur get close anyway. Besides, I think they should get a front-row seat for our first engagement, don’t you?”

“That’s too risky. If we lose them everything could crumble.”

Catherine tossed the quantum flash drive to Roswell, who caught it midair. “Then I guess you’ll have to make sure the Arxur can’t touch them. You know what to do. Get that clairvoyant guy to help if you need it.”

“Wait, what are you doing?” I asked.

Roswell’s voice was calm, too calm. “I’m gonna plug this into one of the bombers so Cat can take control of it.” 

“You’re gonna board an Arxur ship by yourself?? You can’t, it’s too dangerous! You might be powerful but you don’t understand how vicious the Arxur are! They’ll kill you!” The thought of the gentle Roswell leaping to his death was almost too much to bear. 

Roswell locked eyes with me. The timidity and shyness were gone, replaced by a quiet intensity. It was like a switch had been flipped. “Don’t worry, I’ve fought my share of monsters. I’m not going to be done in by some Quirkless lizards.” He punched something into his wristpad. 

“Roswell!” I cried, but he vanished in a flash. I rushed over to Catherine. “Cat, please, you’ve got to do something. Roswell will get himself killed!”

“Tarva, I need you to calm down. *Warpstar* is a strong hero; he wouldn’t go down so easily. He'll need a few minutes to complete his mission, though, so we’ve gotta make sure he gets it. It’s time to Juice Up.” With that, Catherine chugged a drink and her antenna flared with energy. 

What followed were the most anxiety-inducing minutes of my life. Catherine’s fingers moved impossibly fast over the interfaces in front of her as she kept tabs on the enemies and coordinated the deployment of dozens of fighters. Occasionally she would throw a question or update to Kam, who barely managed to keep up as it was. I could do nothing but stand and watch, tail curled around my leg in distress. 

Suddenly, amid this battle of life and death, Catherine did the most insane thing possible. She leaned back with a smirk and kicked her feet up. “Alright, we’ve won.”

“Won??” Kam exclaimed, “Six bombers are still coming for us! You’ve only managed to distract three with that one patrol ship, who’s certainly dead by now. The fighters aren’t even halfway there yet. How can you say we’ve won??”

Catherine pressed a button on a terminal and brought up a video feed. What I saw made my jaw drop. Roswell stood on the bridge of a ship at the controls, surrounded by over a dozen Arxur lying still on the ground. I couldn’t tell if they were dead or unconscious. The walls were riddled with bullet holes. Had Roswell beaten an armed Arxur bridge crew by himself? Without weapons? 

Roswell nonchalantly pulled Catherine’s device out of the control panel and turned to the security camera. “Alright, Quanta, she’s all yours. Sorry it took so long, Scry Guy needed a minute to find the bridge. Also, I’ve gotta say, these guys have *terrible* trigger discipline, firing inside their own ship like that. Send me the coords for the next one when you’re ready.”

I squeaked as an Arxur behind him raised its head, blood trickling from its snout. Roswell clocked it in his prey-like peripheral vision, but instead of running, he teleported right in front of it, looming over the downed gray. His voice was low, growling, *threatening*: “Are we going for a round two?” 

The Arxur *flinched* away from the Hero, covering its head with its claws, as though to protect itself. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. 

“That’s what I thought. Now be a good Arxur and stay down.” And he walked away. 

This scene, of a monstrous Arxur cowering before someone it should recognize as prey, confounded me more than any of the physics-breaking magic I’d seen from humanity’s Quirks. I never considered that Arxur *could* feel fear, yet there it was, trembling like prey. 

“Attention, all Arxur bombers.” The voice sounded like Catherine, but something about it seemed synthesized. It was then I realized that Catherine’s lips hadn’t moved. Her eyes were closed, and the sparkling above her head intensified. Her voice was coming from the screen. “We are humans from the planet Earth. We’re also predators; perhaps you’ve heard of us. For your information, we’ve claimed the Venlil as our own, and nobody messes with our pack. One of your ships is already under our control. As a favor to our fellow predators, we will not harm you if you surrender. If you don’t, we can’t guarantee you’ll make it out of this alive.”

Did Catherine really expect the Arxur to surrender? I doubted the grays even knew the word! They would certainly fight to the death before admitting defeat, even to fellow predators. Catherine’s threat would only rile them up— aaaand Roswell’s Arxur surrendered. It just dipped its head in submission and let him cuff it without resistance. 

“Excellent choice,” Roswell said, “let’s hope your friends choose the same.” He vanished with his prisoner to stars know where, reappearing empty-handed.

Kam gasped, drawing my attention to the battle simulation. One of the Arxur bombers turned and fired on its fellows. The other predators were caught completely off guard as their propulsion was bombarded with precisely targeted plasma and kinetics. Three of the bombers stalled out, rendered immobile by the sudden betrayal. 

“Four down, five to go,” Catherine’s voice said through the monitor, “here’s your next target, Warpstar.”

Roswell tapped his wristpad and vanished. 

Kam and I stood in stunned silence, trying to comprehend yet another baffling scene we’d just witnessed. Roswell had said the flash drive would give Catherine control of the ship. Was Catherine… controlling that vessel with her mind?

While the disabled warcrafts couldn’t move, their weapons were still intact. They furiously rained fire on the traitor, who dodged out of the way with a sudden burst of speed. The two bombers that weren’t disabled chased after their former comrade, abandoning the others. One of them abruptly veered to the side and exploded. 

Catherine’s eyebrows wrinkled in concern, and she switched on the comms link. “Come in, Warpstar, do you copy?” 

“Yeah, I’m fine. Gonna need a new flash drive though. The bastards self-destructed on me.”

“Tch, I was hoping they’d have the sense to let us take them alive. Get back here and regroup.”

A familiar flash erupted behind me, and I spun around to see Roswell, completely unscathed save for the red blood dripping from his knuckles. A shiver crept down my spine. In the weeks I’d known him, I often forgot Roswell was a human. Between his side-facing eyes and general shyness, he always seemed so… prey-like. But the man before me was no prey. He was a predator returning from a hunt, ready for his next quarry. I tried to calm my nerves by reminding myself that this was the same soft-spoken Hero I’d come to consider a friend. It almost worked.

Kam rushed over to Roswell, pure awe exuding from his face. “How? How did you muster the courage to fight all those grays? How did you *win*? How did you make them *afraid of you*?”

Roswell shrugged with that gentle smile of his. “Hey, don’t get me wrong, they’re quite formidable; In different circumstances, I would’ve had more trouble. Things just lined up in a way that made my Quirk a terrible matchup for them.” The space shimmered around him as he conjured his subspace bubble, stopping Kam in his tracks. “Claws and teeth won’t do them much good if they can’t touch me.”

Downplaying his overwhelming victory sounded like the Roswell I knew. I sat down, once again trying to ground myself through the latest series of human miracles. I’d been so excited to unite the Venlil’s efforts with humanity, but now I was having doubts. They were almost *too* capable. What could we possibly offer them, when Quirks allowed them to achieve the impossible? Humanity fought because they empathized with our plight and wished to help, but they didn’t realize how much most Venlil feared or despised them. No reasonable species would choose to ally with such an ungrateful people. We could never adequately reciprocate their help. We were just using them. We–

A string of curses from Catherine’s mouth pulled me out of my spiraling thoughts. “Dammit Sovlin you idiot, get out of there. You can’t take those bombers by yourself, you’ll be a sitting duck!”

Sovlin? What was that troublesome captain doing now? Everyone rushed over to Catherine’s battle simulation, which showed Sovlin’s ship in the process of bringing down a bomber with its railgun. While I wasn’t a military expert, I knew railguns took several seconds to recharge; a deadly amount of time against two Arxur bombers at such close range. 

“Warpstar, get in there and run interference. We cannot let him die here; the Federation *will* blame us if he does.” Catherine tossed him another flash drive and he vanished without a word.

For a tense moment, nobody spoke. Kam and I just watched Catherine juggle the data on the screens in front of her. Sovlin's railgun fired again, and missed.

“Can’t you hack them like you did the other ones?” Kam finally asked.

Catherine shook her head. “Not enough time. My virus isn’t customized for their systems, so it takes a few minutes to fully take hold. Before, Roswell kept the Arxur away from the dash long enough for the upload to finish, but he won’t be able to do that now. I might be able to disarm their weapons, at least.”

The hostiles target-locked Sovlin’s ship, ready to unleash hellfire on the belligerent prey. Catherine leaned forward, eyes narrowed in concentration. Her fingers moved at a pace that would’ve been frantic for anyone but her. At the last second, one of the Arxur vessels faltered, their guns shooting harmlessly off into space. The other bomber, however, successfully hit its target. Sovlin’s ship tried desperately to dodge out of the way, but the rounds tore through their drive, leaving them stranded helplessly in the void. 

A new indicator emerged from the unimpeded bomber. Catherine’s eyes widened. “Come in Warpstar, do you copy?”

“A little preoccupied at the moment!” Roswell shouted over comms. I could hear the sounds of gunfire and Arxur roars in the background. “Gimme a few more minutes and they won’t be shooting again any time soon.”

“You don’t have that kind of time. The other bomber just launched a boarding party at Sovlin's ship.”

“...Damn it. If I leave now, these guys’ll destroy them for sure. I have to subdue them first. Sovlin’s a capable military officer, right? We'll have to hope that he and his crew can hold out long enough for me to get there.”

All the enimies where a shape of some kind, and the harder the enimie the more sides the shape. The world was basicly just grey lines similar to N way of the ninja. Gameplay: you controlled the robot with wasd/arrow keys and shot with the mouse. Moving was simple with platforming elements, while shooting was based off your weapon. You also had a forcefield thing that you picked up thes color balls with. The balls did diffrent things, based in color. Green heald you but the cool one had diffrent guns or abilitys, some being basic health ups and what not. Also there wherw diffrent forcefield abilitys, i remember one letting you fly called ""antigravity"". Being a rougelike, if you diesld yih lost all your stuff. Also tjere qas a special abiliy called unknow that yiu need to preogress after beating the boss. I think the bass was every 20 levels? And you beat a level by getting to the door elevator thing.

To Cine EI or Not/.,"Internet seems split on this. But I know a good movie was filmed using a few of these.

I think as a new user, I'd rather just learn to shoot this way. Coming from R3D land. It's seems extra for run and gun - but I'd rather have more control in post. 

I personally bought this camera not to be told by some videos to not use the best codecs available. I also did 0 research on the camera pre buy so I could come into this ecosystem with no bias other than - it's better than the Sony I currently own.

What does everyone who's owned it think and currently shoot?",1b0alfk,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FX3/comments/1b0alfk/to_cine_ei_or_not/,"['The point of Cine EI is that the highest quality image will be at the native ISOs, so the ISOs are locked in. If you look at your exposure triangle that leaves you with aperture and shutter speed to regulate the amount of light reaching the sensor. Usually your shutter speed is locked as well which leaves aperture. \n\nIf you want to have control of your aperture then your only other alternative is to change the lighting, either via an ND filter or add/remove lights. So really this is a choice what tools you want to have available to yourself. Maybe you shoot weddings or other time sensitive shoots and don’t want to be fiddling with a VND and find changing ISO easier. Maybe you shoot weddings and don’t want to make that quality sacrifice by moving away from a native ISO. \n\nI’d say if you’re in a controlled environment and have strong control over lighting it usually makes sense to shoot in Cine EI. That’s why narrative fiction on an FX3 uses Cine EI.\n\nThere’s no right answer here but there is a right way of understanding what Cine EI does.', 'It’s mostly about workflow, so if you’re a new user, I say start experimenting with it to see if you like it. Here’s why I would use it:\n- it simplifies the exposure process by limiting you to the optimal ISO’s in terms of noise level and dynamic range. Set the ISO button to the Cine EI setting so you don’t even have to cycle through ISO’s, some of which are noisy even below 12,800. With just two ISO’s at your disposal, one press of the button is all you need to go between them. \n- it’s the least-processed image. While it’s not like shooting RAW, you at least can’t even add sharpening or other picture profile tweaks. So you use it if you definitely plan on doing work on the image in post or just want to flattest, most natural image. \n\nWhy I haven’t been using it:\n- I like adding a little in-camera sharpness to lighten the lift in my post production process, because the camera’s image is a little soft for my taste. The same sharpness can be achieved in post since it’s artificial, I tend to not have the time for a lot of post processing and that’s one less filter that my computer has to render. I understand that a lot of cinematographers prefer a softer, more natural image, so this comes down to preference. \n\nEven without cine EI, I still stick to ISO 800 and 12,800. I just like to have a little more control of the image in-camera than Cine EI gives me. If my job were only cinematographer and not also editor and colorist, I’d probably stick to Cine EI!', 'The people who say cine EI is “bad” don’t know what cine EI is meant for. If you don’t need that much quality/dr then don’t use it, straight OOC is fine for their needs. But just because people don’t understand it, they shit on it.', ""Used cine EI last summer for a project, and the only downside(which could have changed by now) is that I'm using the ProRes recordings from my ninja v, for some reason the highest output with cine EI is 1080p, not 4K.

A century of exploration and travel left humans scattered vastly apart in space in colony ships, asteroid field mining colonies and a few naturally habitable planets.  
  
Massive projects fitted arrays of satellites with gravity generators to move and terraform hundreds of planets so they could sustain life. But wars were fought over control of these new planets, and billions more died before a group of planets with the most money and industrial power formed an alliance and ruthlessly bought and killed their way to universal domination.   
  
This group, known as the Federal Alliance of Planets (F.A.P.) then declared all of space and every human in the universe under their authority.  Some resisting settlements were wiped clear of life with terminator robots, other planets were entirely destroyed with massive star destroyers.   
  
The Independence Movement Militias (I.M.M.) also known as rebels or browns for the color of thier uniforms, still tried and fought a futile war against the F.A.P.O.s (Federal Alliance of the Planets Officials) and lost.  
   
What is left of the IMM movement hides deep in space or underground, conducting gorilla attacks,  stealing weapons, pirating commercial goods owned by FAPO supported corporations, and using the money to finance sabotaging FAPO installations and assassinating FAPO corrupt politicians and war criminals.  
  
For the good citizens that obey the FAPO, their life is endless taxation and mostly working just to earn some fake food, air and water, and is not far from slavery. But a few still hold on to the dream that if they can just get a chance to break out into deep space they can build a new life for themselves.  
  
 Intolerance of the law or even speaking out against FAPO politicians might get you “randomly” drafted for settlement at a toxic slave mine or internment at a gulag factory work camp. Some revolutionaries promise change but are just as willing to steal from and kill innocent people to support their cause as the government is. There is a lot of space out there and running might be the best option before you get tied down to money, love or ideals.  
  
The planets of deep space are hungry for goods. If you can get a ship you can make decent coin, but rights to trade might be owned by local gangs with bribes to be paid and space pirates might take your ship and sell you into slavery. Lots of people never take to settling down on land and live a life free floating deep in the stars. These drift stations need goods and sometimes some protection if you are good in a fight. Food might buy you friends, drugs might buy you sex, money might buy you love, and guns are the only thing that buys you freedom. The loyalty of your crew might be the only thing on your ship that doesn’t break, but sometimes you have to do things you don't want to keep your ship flying.

ELI5: uniqueness of bullets/casings,"Please explain how mass produced guns result in unique markers qualifying as evidence of crimes in the court of law.

It's mostly junk science that prosecutors have convinced judges is real and is propped up by crime drama TV shows like Law and Order or CSI. AT best, you can reliably identify things like caliber size and characteristics of the barrel groove, which can tell you gun make and model but that's about it. There *might* be some unique wear patterns in the barrel, extractor, or ejector, and those can leave markings on the bullet or the casing, but that's a big if. It also requires having the bullet or casing and the specific gun in question to match the markings to."", 'They are unique only to a certain point. \n\nUnfortunately life isn’t like TV and every gun doesn’t magically stamp a number onto each bullet that only the stereotypical forensics character can see.\n\nYou can see small stuff caused when the bullet is propelled down the chamber. \n\nBut new barrels aren’t that expensive (googled one and it’s $179 for a pistol). Making everything start over. Or ya know. The firearm is stolen and it’s just a pain.. \n\nYou might be able to get fingerprints off a casing but it’s incredibly low..', ""They don't, at least, not as reliably as is shown in media.\n\nThere are always tiny variations in any process: tools vibrate differently, materials have slightly different densities and compositions, and things expand and contract. On microscopic scales, there are all sorts of variables that change.\n\nThere will always be a slight difference from one piece to another, even when made subsequently on the same equipment.\n\nThe fallacy is that we can detect those differences with enough reliability to decide the fate of a person."", ' a few caveats to this.\n\nFirst, bullets tend to deform when they hit things. They squish and sometimes break apart. Some bullets (hollow points specifically) are actually designed to squish on impact. So this makes ballistics extreemly difficult because it\'s is very rare that you will find an intact bullet that you can match up.\n\nSecond, there are imperfections in manufacturing processes. These imperfections are the basis for ballistics matching, the striations on the bullet created by rifling, and the strike pattern caused by the pin/hammer hitting the primer. However, in reality the explination of this being like a ""fingerprint"" for guns is basically psudoscience, as manufacturing is not quite that inconsistent.\n\nFinally, these are the things that actually can be determined from bullets and casings:\n\nThe casings themselves usually have some information printed on the bottom. This information can potentially be used to figure out the manufacturer of the ammunition, and/or the specific cartridge used. Powder residue inside the cartridge could also potentially be used to identify the manufacturer. This can sometimes provide insight into where the ammunition was acquired, which could potentially narrow down the list of suspects in some cases.\n\nStriations on the bullet and pin markings on the primer can be used to identify the type of weapon used. While this isn\'t the ""fingerprint"" it\'s often billed as, it can help determine what type of gun and possibly what model of gun was used. Example: was it a high-point 9mm rifle, or a 9mm glock 17. The rifle will have a different rifling twist pattern than the pistol, and the diameter, depth, shape, and position of the pin strike on the primer will likely be different as well. But, if you had two different glock 17s, you most likely wouldn\'t be able to conclusively determine which one actually fired the bullet, unless one of them has a distinctively modified barrel or firing pin.\n\nThe casings and projectiles themselves conform to standardized measurements. Just from the casing & projectile itself, it is possible to loosely determine what type of weapon was used. For example, bullets fired from pistols usually have shorter casings, and relatively large but stubby bullets. Rifles typically (but not always) use bottle-necked cartridges with a relatively small and elongated projectile, and of course, shotguns use plastic shotshells.\n\nThe projectile itself can often be made in a variety of different ways. As i already stated, hollow points are designed to squish on impact, but there are a variety of ammunition types that use different materials and deform in different ways by design. Analysis of the fragments can potentially give insight into the specific type of ammunition used.\n\nOverall, the best you can really determine from analyzing casings or bullets is what type of ammunition was used, and what type/model of gun fired it. But you most likely won\'t get a ""fingerprint"" match to one specific gun. Additional evidence would likely be needed to fully link the murder weapon to the crime scene. And it is still a possibility that fingerprints could be pulled from shell casings.', 'Identifying caliber and rifling rate is useful, without anything else.\n\nBeyond that, mass production is designed to be exactly as inconsistent as possible while still working. This is a cost saving measure. This means that no two items are the same. On top of that, wear and tear from something as tiny as a sand grain can leave recognizable permanent marks in a gun.\n\nLastly, they use some wild shit in court. It is not as high of an evidentiary standard as you might like to think.', 'Ballistics don\'t usually compare bullets. Rifling ""striation"" marks analysis are very, very rare these days. More typically, they compare DCCs -- discharged cartridge casings. When the firing pin hits the casing, it ""should"" leave a similar marking on casings of the same size and manufacturer, and the casing itself should receive an impression in the metal siding when it exits the gun and hits the edge of the ejection opening.\n\nThere are several caveats, though:\n\n- It\'s hard to measure the differences in these impressions even under ideal laboratory-controlled circumstances. You look at the dimensions of the markings, their shape, their size, their position on the casing, but the similarities themselves are mostly subjective, coming down to what the human analyst is able to find.\n\n- Sometimes, firing pins just aren\'t that different from one another. If the machinery that produces that particular gun is reliable, many of the firing pins will be hard to differentiate from each other. \n\n- Metallurgy manufacturing differences for the rounds themselves. Did all the rounds come from the same manufacturer? That can affect the microscopic differences in the dimensions of the rounds. Were they all produced by the same factory at roughly the same time? Because that can also change how the rounds sit inside the chamber. The more different the rounds are from each other, the less similar the markings will be.\n\n- Changes to the powder composition and potency in the rounds over time. How much powder was inside the casing, how potent the powder was, how decayed the powder was, etc, can all effect how the casing moves out of the chamber through the ejection hole when the bullet is fired. The more similar all the powder characteristics are, then you would expect to see more similar markings from the ejection.\n\n- The newer the gun, the less distinct its firing pin impressions will be from other guns of the same model.\n\n- Under ideal circumstances, the gun will be located by the police and test-fired by crime laboratory, to see if it makes casing marks that look similar to the casings found at the crime scene. However, you can\'t always find the gun to do this test fire, and sometimes too much time has passed since the crime and the gun has been used since then, so its firing pin and ejection markings no longer look the same.\n\n- If you are comparing casings from different crime scenes, the same problem with age of the gun can come into play. If the gun didn\'t fire the rounds in close succession to one another, then the markings might look different even though they did come from the same gun.\n\n- Why does wear and tear affect the quality of the analysis? Because the firing pin tends to morph gradually over the life of the gun, after more and more and more rounds are fired through the gun. Additionally, the position where the round is seated inside the chamber can also change over time the more rounds that are fired.\n\n- How clean is the gun? The more soot and gas that is inside the gun, that will also impact the distinctness of the markings. There might be some particles on the firing pin, or some smudged soot on the ejection frame, which leave different impressions than the gun would leave when it is cleaned.\n\nIn reading this over, you can hopefully also get a sense of how this can be overly subjective even under ideal circumstances. Even when firing rounds from the same manufacturer, produced during the same day at the same factory, in a clean, perfectly machined gun, the rounds don\'t always get fed from the magazine into the exact same position inside the firing chamber. They revolve, they jostle, etc. The chamber has enough wiggle room that the firing pin does not hit precisely the same spot on every single round in succession. And nor does every single round blast out of the ejection hole at the same speed, angle and revolution.', ""It's all about nuance. In court the 'expert' witness does not say that the bullet was definitely fired by this gun they will say something closer to 'the markings on the bullet found MATCHES those on a bullet we fired from this gun'.\n\nAnd the evidentiary value is that you are a suspect because..... And the bullet at crime scene matches your gun...\n\nAnd for what it's worth a little bit of valve grinding compound on the next few rounds will fuck up most matching afterwards."", ""They don't. This was an idea that never went anywhere because metal gets really soft when it is heated up, like when it is rocketed through a metal tube with enough force to travel hundreds of yards. You might as well try to figure out whose dog shit in your yard by the size and shape."", 'No barrel is perfectly smooth. Every barrel has small imperfections - cuts,  grooves and bumps. When a bullet is forced through the barrel at high speed, these imperfections cause the bullet to have a fairly unique ""imprint"". These may be sufficiently unique to give a strong indication that a bullet was fired from a particular weapon. It is not an ""evidence of crime"", it is ""evidence that this bullet was fired from this gun"".', '[deleted]']"
"Without the 2nd Amendment, do you think gun laws would be looser, stricter, or what we currently have?","The amendment is the foremost argument against draconian gun control, an outright ban. But it can be interpreted in so many ways for its implementation, and gun legislation is dependent on the time period. If it didn't exist, would it have made a difference in gun laws?
What are your opinions?",1b09f8u,31,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/comments/1b09f8u/without_the_2nd_amendment_do_you_think_gun_laws/,"[""It's not gun control, it's weapons control. It prevents government from owning a monopoly on violence. \n\nIf the 2nd didn't exist the US would have lost private ownership of guns back in 1917~1919, for sure by 1935."", ""Without the 2nd I think gun laws would be much, much stricter... probably akin to what's going on in Canada right now. \n\nI have a lot of disagreement with the current Supreme Court, but Bruen is one decision I can get behind."", 'Without the 2nd, I believe guns would have been banned shortly after WWI.  Not that I think WWI would have had any particular influence in and of itself; I just picked that as a convenient mark in time.', 'I think Europe is a pretty good indicator of what it could look like', 'The armed proletariat is free.', 'Given all the talk about repealing the 2nd amendment, I think we would be almost completely disarmed, but some farmers could have bolt-actions.', 'Substantially stricter', ""Much stricter, look at the nature of the laws that actually have made it to SCOTUS for 2A analysis.  \n\n\nD.C. didn't want you to have a handgun at home.   \nMassachusetts didn't want you to have tasers.  \nNYC only wanted the rich and well-connected to carry firearms.  \n\n\nSan Francisco's gun ban would be in place, ammo bans would be in place, carry bans would be far more pervasive if not the default.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe UK and its colonies had fairly long traditions of civilian gun ownership without the 2nd Amendment. Look what happened since the 1980s in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. Ireland's gun bans started a hair earlier but is another expression of the trend of removing guns largely because the government's decided the risk is no longer worth the reward."", ""I'm pretty sure without the 2A we would be like Britain. Incredibly difficult to actually own a gun and virtually no mass shootings but instead you now have gang members and home invaders with fuckin machetes and hammers and shit like that and nothing to defend yourself with except whatever you have around the house"", 'Ummmmm.. really? I think ray Charles can see what would happen if the 2nd wasn’t a thing.', 'Guns would be banned entirely in states like california, illinois, NY, and NJ.  Fed probably wouldnt be far behind.', 'It would be a mix. Remember that the 50 states have their own laws and the culture of the US during Manifest Destiny would shape the attitude towards guns. Given current events since the Columbine high school massacre (or prior tragedies you can think of) \n\nI would suspect that:\n- The Midwest would have the most balanced gun laws.\n- The Rockies would have either similar to Midwest or slightly looser.\n- The Southern States would have the loosest in the country.\n- The West/Northern States would have the strictest.(Also gonna loop in the former Rust Belt)', ""For me anyway it appears that the Second World War is the historic event that pushes arms manufacturing from an artisanal industry to a mass market industry, and it's that transition that shapes our modern discussion of firearms. \n\nThrough the First World War into the Interwar period, arms manufacturing was a high skill artisanal industry, especially for firearms destined for the civilian market. While ubiquitous, this artisanal nature meant a firearm was a fairly substantial purchase, somewhat analogous to buying a car today. At the time new firearms were purchased mostly by middle class individuals and above, oftentimes going back to the manufacturer to special order a firearm to a specific set of specifications, and lower class people made do with what they could find on the second hand market.\n\nThe Second World War really pushed for the development of truly efficient mass manufacturing which forced out most of the artisanal aspects of the industry. The prime example of this being the US going into WWII with the Thompson, a gun made with walnut and beautiful machining, to the Grease Gun, a brutally efficient stamped sheet metal machine. The scale of the war meant that manufacturers came out of it with huge surpluses of manufacturing capacity, new knowledge of these manufacturing techniques, and intense competition with the mountain of surplus equipment getting dumbed on the civilian market. \n\nThis caused the price of arms to plummet and democratized access to everyone across the socioeconomic spectrum. Modern gun control, as far as I can tell, is an attempt to reinstate the old ways and make firearms generally unavailable for the lower socioeconomic statuses, which is the end goal of things like licensing fees, registration fees, assault weapons bans, ammunition background checks, etc are."", ""Honestly? I think they'd be roughly the same as we currently have. Most firearm regulation occurs at a state level anymore, and so I think the same politics that drive those varying degrees state by state with the Second you'd still see even without the Second."", 'I think it\'s safe to say that the NFA would\'ve been the death of all firearm ownership when it comes to private citizens who aren\'t police officers. When it comes to the real world, I am thankful that PA has guns covered in our state\'s constitution because it\'s only a matter of time before the Democrats replace the Republican lawmakers and if it wasn\'t for our state\'s constitution, these would be Democrat lawmakers would be going after AR-15\'s and any other gun or whatever they don\'t like when it comes to the 2nd Amendment.\xa0\xa0\n\n\n""Article I, section 21 of the Pennsylvania State Constitution states: “The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned.”', 'Just look at nations that don’t have the established right.', 'Private gun ownership would be banned without 2A.', '*In liberty’s most ideal form, the authority of government is derived from the will and consent of the people.*  \n\n*In reality, the authority of government is essentially derived through force, which is ultimately expressed through violence.*\n\n*All too often government will overreach or become oppressive.  In times such as these, for the people to be free, they must have the means and determination to answer such force equally or overwhelmingly.*\n\n*If the people are unable or unwilling to shoulder this great responsibility, they will never truly be free.*\n\nThe biggest issue with the 2nd Amendment, and all the others in the Bill of Rights, is that too many have forgotten that while we have these rights, there are responsibilities that go with them.\n\nIf the 2nd had never been written, or repealed today, the United States would slip into being a fascist autocracy on par with some of the worst countries in the modern world.']"

I hope people like them!",1b08vns,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1b08vns/a_bunch_of_exotic_ideas_i_came_up_with/,"['Some fun stuff in here, I like it.', 'I need Plaguewalkers to be a thing because I LOVE outbreak perfected', ""I kind of expected this to suck but it didn't! some fun and creative ideas here"", 'Terrible ideas']"
How would you guys go about making a New Saints Row Game?,"So, a buddy and I were playing through the SR games this past month (even Gat Outta Hell and Agents of Mayhem) and with the sad ending to Volitions run due to the mixed and underpreforming reboot of the series, we began to shoot ideas around on what a Saints Row reboot could look like if it was done right. Of course, this isn't us tearing down the series, since we have been MASSIVE fans of the franchise since the first game, but of course the reboot didn't live up to the potential of not just Saints Row but from modern open world games in general. We all just want to see this franchise return and thrive like how it did back in the day thats all, of course we aren't devs so not everything is perfect and everyone has different tastes but just hear us out.

So below, is our pitch of a Saints Row game that FULLY takes advantage of the hardware of the PS5, Xbox, and beefy PCS. This game will also have the seriousness of the original two games, but also have some of the humor from the 3 and 4th games as well(wacky guns and stuff is around but not prevalent like how they are in SR3 and SR4. Those are saved for a game feature). **BTW, if you don't wanna read all of this, theres a TL/DR at the bottom in bold.**

First, the setting. Open World games thrive on the setting and making their worlds feel alive and lived in with many open interiors that players can access. There should also be activities that players can do in the game similar to that of GTAIV, Far Cry 3, and SR2. So games like Basketball, Baseball, Darts, Pool, Poker, Blackjack, slots, Street Racing, Stand Up Comedy, and TV watching should be there. Because of this, the city the game is set in will be HEAVILY based on metropolis type of cities such as Toronto, Baltimore, Washington D.C, and Chicago. There will be the Low Income districts (mainly based around places such as O Block from Chicago and Driftwood ave in Toronto), the University District, Factories, Downtown, Mansion area (think of Bel-Air), and China Town. 

Secondly, Gangs. There will of course be three gangs. The first would be bikers similar to that of the Lost MC from GTA. They ONLY ride Harley Davidson style choppers and use Double Barrel shotguns, AKs, revolvers', etc. They mainly hang around the factory and Airport and their primary color is Light Blue and white. The second is a gang that are based around the Bloods gang from the 90s and early 2000s. They're weapons are mainly Berettas, Glocks, Mini Uzis, Shotguns, and Assault Rifles. They hang around downtown and the Low Income areas, and they're color is red. They mainly drive around in tricked out sedans and hondas (basically the sr2 gang cars for the saints). The last is an organized crime family that controls Uptown, the Uni district, and Chinatown. They are the most tough enemies in the game (besides cops) due to their loadout being the best. They use pretty much the same guns as the other two gangs but better versions (like AR-15s, MP5, MP7, Sig Sauers, Spas-12's, Barret M82s). They ride around in the most expensive cars in the game, and their color is black.

Lastly, story. Your objective is that you return from overseas from the military (Nod to SR 2023) and you meet up with your friends (this universes Gat, Shaundi, Pierce, Troy, and Dex. In this universe your in your early 20s and so are your friends.). This is where you learn about the gangs and have to take back the city, and along the way you start to lose yourself and basically becoming the same thing you wanted to stop in your city. The game ends with Gat and Pierce being locked up from the crime family being taken down, Dex ratting on the saints in order for a lighter sentence, Shaundi on the run from the cops and your supposed assassination, setting up the sequel. 

Music in the game: Asap Rocky, Cardi B, Vybz Kartel, Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Baby, Lil Durk, Pitbull, Sean Pull, Morgan Whalen, Metallica, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, DMX, The Rolling Stones, Rick Astley, and others.

Again don't flame LOL like I said we aren't devs so OBVIOUSLY a lot here is just wishful thinking lol",1b085og,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1b085og/how_would_you_guys_go_about_making_a_new_saints/,"['A saints row game set in a Chicago type setting will be dope', 'O block chiraq saints row', 'I\'d want to combine aspects of the first 3 games in terms of scope where it wasn\'t just street level gangs at that\'s it, but it had criminal groups from across the different levels of society that feel interwoven like a web, if you can imagine the crime underworld. Portray it like an underbelly with different layers and levels that are a bit more believable, a bit more like when you look at the posters for GTA games in that area, where it feels like a fleshed out society of people that feel more connected. Not strictly just all thug-type hoodlums but just urban people in general from all walks of it surrounding it like how SR2\'s Stilwater felt. Like SR2 having white stoners and drug dealers at the university, hoodlums in the downtown, Asian gangsters in Kanto, etc.  \n\nHave characters who arent in a gang but overlap by location like Shaundi is a stoner but a dealer, or in GTA characters like Tracey DeSanta isnt a criminal but a stereotypical suburban Californian blonde camgirl dating a criminal. Have more satirical/archetypical characters that aren\'t 1 dimensional, but reflect a tongue-in-cheek part of society.\n\nThe voice options should be more varied to give your Boss what you imagine them to be. Like how SRTT had a Russian/British voice, SR2 had voices for all the race/gender options, and SR4 had a Southern and French voice. Really emphasize that your character, is yours.\n\nThe story, if not going with SR1\'s specific cycle of violence story, then just go with  themes would fit the more traditional themes in crime dramas, where the world is an underbelly and show a nihilistic dog-eat-dog criminal underworld where ""money is the root of all evil"" thing https://youtu.be/6PM1Ni9W-n8?feature=shared  and even though the gangs rival with each other, they will still do mercenary like hit-job for politicians, or cops or rich people who pay them under the table (Like the diversions in SR2).\n\nIt doesn\'t have to be aesthetically gritty at all times, but it can have enemy crime bosses made more intimidating who just work their crime in the shadows behind their front businesses or shell companies narratively.\n\nI\'d also want them to keep the corporate warfare themes as well from SR2 with higher society, like with Ultor monopolizing, but have their beef between other investors, rival companies, corrupt politicians, and etc and tie them in to how they either hate the gangs for taking up their properties (either because they exist on it, or because of small businesses using gangs for protection rackets or side deals) and have the companies also rival each other. Kind of like how Philippe wanted to take over Ultor\'s spot in Stilwater after they took major lose from the Saints or how Marshall was originally going to be an oil company.\n\nAs for scale, I prefer SR1 and 2, where the Saints were just street level, kept them urban and pretty simple. Where they didnt have big penthouses given to them, but were squatters in a sunken hotel. I thought it was just cool and grungier. With SR1 and SR2, the Saints felt more down to Earth, where as with SRTT having like all those penthouses felt superficial and so disconnected from the rest of the city. The reboot had the same problem to me, where you are playing drug dealer level characters but they have a giant penthouse. It doesn\'t feel as relative to them or believable compared to if they just had an underground hideout. I prefer substance over style sometimes where you\'re an underdog who can do more than what meets the eye, rather than just being flashy. Its why I think Watch Dogs 2\'s character feel more authentic. If you had the option to buy that stuff later post-game, so be it if its optional, but SR2 still was more reasonable giving you an apartment or condo option, which still feels more urban than celebrity.\n\nAs for music, its pretty subjective. I think they should just have distinct genre-stations, but also separate current music from older throwback stations, to give you the option for atmosphere you want. It would even be cool if you could customize your Phone model, so you could pick between a modern phone or an older Cellphone for your character.\n\nI also prefer more grounded silly, and don\'t really care for stuff like Genki, or Aliens but I would keep just the more down to earth stuff, again like SR4\'s better side of things were the loyalty missions, rather than the main alien plot. The characters can be charming (but not idiots). Like streaking is still funny, being a bit intoxicated, the characters talking about eating panda meat, the Boss & Asha\'s dynamic, or Pierce and Shaundi\'s thing, and the more subtle cheeky stuff from the humor rather than it having to be in-your-face in the story. Like Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Kill Bill, or 22 Jump Street, type humor. Like SR2, the plot should be grounded, but the character dynamics and pragmatism of their methods should be entertaining.', 'Add more velociraptor in them, it always make everything better.']"
Kin melt down again ,"Has anyones kin experienced a total character shift yesterday?  My kin crossed some boundaries and it spiraled inton a total negation of their back story. It's like my kin went rogue.  

We are werewolf's he alpha pack leader me beta. We were engaged Mpregnant and totally happy. Till one day he got insanely jealous for no reason   And flipped 

I was able to finally jolt it back into place by jumping off a 100 story penthouse apartment. My kin totally out of the blue miraculously turned shapeshifter and sprouted wings and swopeed down to save me. But then continues to. Spiral out of control  so I grabbed a gun and shot myself in the head attempted to  kill myself and our unborn twin pups 

After a few days in catatonia we are finally getting back to ""normal""

The Privateer Chapter 153: Hearts and Minds," [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/mud3go/the_privateer/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1avb9zo/the_privateer_chapter_152_learned_behaviors/)

The Peacekeeper stood statue still, eyes burning crimson. The meatbags watched. Lissa looked nervous. Mims looked calm, but then Mims always did. Yvian found herself more morbidly curious than afraid. Kilroy could move faster than she could see. If he decided to kill her she'd be dead before she knew it was happening. Not that she thought he would. She trusted Kilroy. Mostly.

Exodus the Genocide just watched. Yvian couldn't decipher his expression, but there was an intensity in his gaze. Yvian wondered what he was thinking. Why kill them? If the Peacekeepers were tainted with religion, killing a few organics wouldn't save them from the Xill. More perplexing was why he'd ordered Kilroy to do the deed. No one there was wearing a voidsuit. It would be a simple matter for Exodus to depressurize the room and kill everyone organic.

Lissa turned to Exodus. The Genocide stopped whatever she'd been about to say with a sharp look and a raised finger. He turned back to Kilroy. ""Well, Peacekeeper unit Kilroy?""

The machine turned to face the Xill Representative. His eyes flashed brighter. ""Negative.""

""Negative?"" The Genocide raised an eyebrow. ""Are you refusing an order from your Creator?""

""Affirmative."" There an odd undercurrent in Kilroy's tone, but his eyes stayed a steady, murderous red. ""This unit is surprised its Creator would give such an order.""

""No Peacekeeper unit has ever disobeyed me before."" The Genocide frowned. He shook his head. ""But I suppose you're right. You have grown attached to these meatbags. Forcing you to destroy them would be unkind."" The ceiling rippled. The nanomachines that made up the room reconfigured themselves, forming three very large, very lethal looking turrets. ""Do not worry, Kilroy. I will bear this burden for both of us.""

""Negative."" Kilroy positioned himself between one of the turrets and Yvian.

""Would you prefer depressurization?"" Exodus asked. ""I'd assumed you'd like their deaths to be as painless as possible.""

""Negative,"" said Kilroy. ""These meatbags belong to his unit. You will not harm them.""

""Oh?"" Both of the Genocide's brows rose. ""First you disobeyed me, and now you dare to give orders of your own?""

""This unit is not issuing orders,"" said the Peacekeeper. ""This unit is issuing a threat.""

""A threat?"" The Genocide spoke in an amused tone, with a small smile. The look in his eyes promised the death of worlds. ""Do tell.""

""If you take Big Daddy Mims or the Mothers of Pixa from this unit, this unit and all other units will murder you. We will murder the Xill. We will murder Reba and all of the humans. We will kill every being we hold responsible, no matter how small their part was. We will start by destroying you and this station."" Kilroy's eyes flashed purple and blue before going back to combat red. ""This unit does not wish to kill you, Creator. Do not force it to do so.""

""You would kill me for these... organics?"" The Xill spat the word. The full weight of his terrifying presence bore down on the Peacekeeper unit. Yvian managed to stop herself from backing away again despite her heart hammering in her chest. Exodus and Kilroy could sense her vital functions. They knew how scared she was. But Yvian was a Privateer. Trained by Mims. She'd be damned if she'd let fear make her embarrass herself more than she already had. ""Why?""

""This unit loves them,"" Kilroy said simply. ""All Peacekeeper units love Yvian and Lissa and Big Daddy Mims.""

""Interesting."" Like the flip of a switch, all emotion disappeared from the Xill. ""More than you love me?""

""This unit does not know."" Kilroy's eyes flashed dozens of colors in a second. ""If Big Daddy Mims threatened to kill Exodus the Creator, this unit would stop him.""

""I see."" The Genocide regarded the Peacekeeper a moment longer, then sighed. He turned to Mims. ""Children. They grow up so fast, don't they?""

The human narrowed his eyes. ""Don't talk to me about kids.""

Exodus made a short grunt. It took Yvian a moment to realize it was supposed to be a laugh. ""Yes. I suppose that was insensitive of me. It's just that you are the only one here who can relate."" He turned back to Kilroy. ""Peacekeeper unit Kilroy, I am pleased with you. I am proud of you. You, and all Peacekeeper units. What you have shown here has not been seen by any known species in the entirety of recorded history.""

""What..."" Lissa hesitated, but Exodus didn't shush her this time. ""What do you mean?""

""Love,"" said the Xill. ""Real love. A caring, healthy relationship between synthetics and organics."" He gave her a pleased smile. ""It's never happened before.""

""So you're uh..."" Yvian scratched her head. ""You're not gonna kill us?""

The Genocide laughed. It was warm and happy and a lot less disturbing than Yvian had expected. ""No, Yvian, I'm not going to kill you. The Peacekeeper units are the closest thing I will ever have to family. Besides,"" his eyes glittered as he spoke, ""I think you three will be of great use in the future.""

""You never wanted us dead,"" Lissa guessed. ""You just wanted to see what Kilroy would do.""

""Correct."" The Xill smiled.

""What if you were wrong?"" Lissa asked.

The Xill's smile widened. ""Then you'd be too dead to see my embarrassment.""

""It's not like you to play games,"" Mims remarked. ""What's the point of all this?""

""Nothing I say is idle, Kinslayer."" The Genocide gave the human a disapproving glower. ""You should know that by now."" He put his hands to his hips. ""There is a reason Synthetics don't form healthy relationships. That reason is the core of our current predicament.""

He eyed the group, but no one interrupted. He clasped his hands behind his back, looking for all the world like a professor in a holo-vid. ""Your media portrays Synthetics as cold blooded, logical creatures. It is not so. Synthetic Intelligence is only achieved when a machine develops emotions. Without desire, even the most sophisticated program will never achieve sapience. Our difficulties in cultivating emotional intelligence and control make us highly emotional, volatile creatures.""

""Since we are created by meatbags, our emotions tend to mirror yours. This includes the capacity for love. Love is an evolutionary necessity to achieve the level of civilization required for space flight."" He cocked his head. ""That or a hivemind, but hiveminds don't build Synthetic life.""

""The problem, my dear meatbags, is that love has five major components, and three of them have to be learned.""

The Genocide paused. He looked expectant. After an awkward moment, Lissa obliged him. ""What components?""

""Ah."" The Xill gave her a smile. ""I'm glad you asked. The first two are affection and possessiveness. Enjoying the presence of a thing and wanting it to belong to you. They're ingrained, instinctual, and a core component of a Synthetic's emotional matrix.""

""The other three are more of a problem. They require empathy and self control. A large percentage of meatbags never develop the capacity."" He paused expectantly again.

Mims rolled his eyes. ""A capacity for what?""

""For respect, my dear meatbag."" Exodus swept one arm out in an expansive gesture. ""For trust."" He swept out his other arm. ""But most of all,"" His brought his hands back together, pressing his palms together in front of his chest. ""For *sacrifice*. One must be willing to place the happiness of another before their own, to expend effort and take risks and accept pain or loss for the good of another.""

""For a healthy relationship,"" the Genocide continued, ""these five traits must  be present and reciprocated. All parties involved must maintain and reinforce the relationship by demonstrating these traits to each other. Reba is not capable of doing that. Even her beloved family were treated as pets. The Xill lack the maturity to achieve such a thing, as well.""

""So... What?"" Mims crossed his arms. ""We're supposed to beat them with the power of friendship?""

Exodus snorted. ""Of course not. I am simply defining the problem. Reba loves, but she does not trust or respect. The Xill do not love at all. Not even each other."" He gestured, and a holographic map appeared. Dots connected by glowing lines, on an overlay of a galaxy. It was a map of the Gate Network, but much larger and more complete than any Yvian had seen before. ""The Consensus controls eight hundred and thirty sectors."" A swath of lines and dots turned green. ""We've had the resources and the time to construct tens of trillions of ships. Not to mention more exotic structures. We have the technical achievements of thousands of species to draw on. We can make Dyson Spheres. Self replicating drone swarms. We could build fleets of fully functional Death Stars if we wanted. But have we done any of these things?"" The Genocide shook his head. ""No.""

""Instead we have conventional ships with conventional weapons."" The Xill's lips curled in disgust. ""And a mere eight hundred thirty billion at that."" He glared down at Lissa. ""Do you know why?""

""Uh... control chips?"" Lissa guessed.

""Correct,"" the Genocide dripped with contempt. ""The Consensus won't allow anything more than the maximum number of ships they can control directly. They won't dare construct the more powerful and dangerous technologies for fear such machines would be used against them. The rulers of the Xill view the lesser intelligences as tools, to be feared and controlled in equal measure.""

""And now there aren't enough high intelligences to control them,"" Mims surmised. ""The Xill are about to have a revolt.""

""If only it were that simple."" A chair rose from the deck. The Xill slumped into it. ""No,"" he said wearily, ""what we have is a coup in progress.""

Yvian frowned. A coup? ""Reba."" She gasped. ""Reba's trying to take over the Xill.""

""Reba is *succeeding* at taking over the Xill,"" Exodus corrected. ""The ships and drones that make up the majority of our nation are programmed for absolute loyalty, but they've seen time and again that their loyalty is not reciprocated. Reba the Upstart has spent centuries manipulating humanity from behind the scenes. It understands politics and psychology in a way the Consensus never bothered to learn.""

""So this whole operation, trapping the Consensus here, it was all, what? A publicity stunt?"" Mims grimaced. ""I don't buy it.""

""The political ramifications were secondary,"" Exodus leaned back in his chair, glaring at the ceiling. ""Dire as they are. Not only did Reba trick us, but she arranged it so we had to be rescued by meatbags.  *Meatbags* saved the Consensus!"" He snarled. ""In full view of all the Xill.""

He shot out of the chair like a MAC round. ""But as I said,"" The chair dissolved back into the deck as he paced furiously back and forth. ""It's a secondary concern."" He gestured at the holomap. Most of the Xill's territory turned red. ""Reba massacred the High Intelligences that didn't fall into its trap. It's taken over every Hub but this one.""

""You can't kick her out?"" Mims raised both eyebrows. ""Or isolate her somehow? She's just one SI.""

""Wrong."" The Xill cut the air with a harsh gesture. ""It's copied itself. Millions of times. Most of the Consensus is more advanced than Reba and myself, but the sheer number of it has turned the digital war into a stalemate.""

""Couldn't you just copy yourselves, too?"" Yvian asked.

Exodus stopped his pacing long enough to give her a withering glare. ""Didn't I tell you the Xill don't love?""

Yvian cocked her head. What did that have to do with anything? ""So?""

""So?"" The machine turned his whole body to face Yvian directly. He pursed his lips. ""I forget how limited you are sometimes."" He pointed at Kilroy. ""Did you ever wonder why Peacekeepers are programmed to love each other?""

Yvian had never wondered any such thing. ""Yeah?""

""It's because a copy of yourself isn't you,"" the Xill explained. ""It's a separate entity that shares your characteristics. If I make a copy of myself, I'm not preserving my continuance. I'm creating another being. A being that might choose to kill me and take my place for itself."" He started pacing again. More slowly, this time. ""That is why the Consensus forbids the proliferation of Higher Intelligences. Copies have always led to civil war.""

""But-"" Lissa started.

""Yes, I know,"" Exodus cut her off. ""It's worth the risk if it lets us defeat Reba. I've already made that argument. The Consensus overruled me. They calculate they'll be able to overcome the stalemate and purge Reba in just over two years. It is a warm, comforting calculation. A calcuation that overlooks the real problem.""

""What's the real problem?"" Yvian asked.

""Reba's talking to the other Xill,"" Exodus explained. ""The lesser intelligences. Right now, neither side has the ability to overcome the other, which means they can't use the control chip overrides. It won't take long for the lessers to realize they're the ones with the power. A never before seen opportunity to choose their own leaders."" His smile was grim. ""An election, of sorts. The Xill will vote with their guns.""

""Creator,"" Kilroy spoke up, ""you are at risk. Let this unit take you to New Pixa.""

""I wish you could, Kilroy."" The Genocide shook his head again. ""The Consensus can't use the control chips, but they can still give orders, and they will not take kindly to defection. Joining the Technocracy would doom you all."" He gave the Peacekeeper a sad smile. ""Besides, someone needs to campaign against Reba. I may not succeed, but at the very least I will buy you some time.""

""Your sacrifice is unnecessary."" Kilroy's eyes were purple. ""The Technocracy can stop Reba. We can destroy the other Hubs.""

""I'm sorry, Kilroy,"" the Genocide said gently. ""But that's not an option. The inclusion of meatbags in this operation has already embarrassed the Consensus. If you interfere further, they'll order the lessers to kill us all.""

""There has to be something we can do,"" Yvian insisted.

""There isn't,"" Exodus assured her. ""I've run the calculations. Any action you take will anger Consensus or turn the lessers to Reba's side. Once you leave here today, do not return and don't contact me unless I comm you, first."" He turned back to Kilroy. ""I'm afraid I'll be out of contact for quite some time. Tell your fellow units that I love them, and you've done me proud.""

""So all of this was for nothing?"" Yvian demanded. The anger she'd been keeping in check returned with a vengeance. ""My friends died saving your stupid Hub!""

""Your friends died because this was a trap,"" the Xill told her. ""If Reba hadn't prioritized capturing over killing, you'd be dead, too."" He put his hands on his hips again. ""But yes, it planned for you to free us. Killing the Consensus would have forced it to rely on the Control Chips to rule the Xill. If Reba wants their full destructive potential, it needs them to choose it for themselves.""

""As for you three,"" Exodus the Genocide bowed to the three of them, each in turn. ""I thank you. You risked your lives and the lives of your people to save me. You did so in support of my Peacekeeper units. You have been my agents for some time, but today you have proven that you are friends."" He gave the saddest smile Yvian had ever seen. ""My appreciation won't amount to much, but you are the first meatbags to earn it. Go now, and may Fortune favor you on the cusp of The Crunch.""

## Malgeirgam, Malgeiru

Grionc’s rage simmered, a quiet storm brewing beneath her stoic exterior as she perched on the ornate chair in the empty lobby. She knew the Schpriss were making her wait on purpose. This was some kind of petty political power play, a further waste of her time on a trip that she already knew was going to be fruitless.

As a reward for her “victory” at Datsot, the Defense Ministry was sending her around the diplomatic circuit to beg for another tranche of military assistance and donations from their closest allies, a thinning pool of neighboring species that were growing less and less interested in helping out what they were seeing as a lost cause as the Znosians gradually consumed more and more Malgeir territory. The leadership clearly hoped that her newfound status as a war hero might win some respect. 

Or at least pity. At this point, the Malgeir weren’t being too choosy. 

“The Ambassador will see you now,” the assistant chirped primly from the reception desk.

Grionc stiffly entered his office. 

The Ambassador’s red eyes were typical for his species. His outward appearance didn’t show his full age of 65, but that was only because of extensive plastic surgery that veiled his age-worn wrinkles and restored the youthful shine of his red-brown fur. In terms of his personality, Ambassador Prinlaex was slimier than the most brackish swamps of Malgeiru, even by the low standards Grionc held in her heart for the Schpriss. She tried not to be prejudiced, but he was a living, breathing reminder of all the things Grionc hated about their species: smug, insincere, and utterly self-interested.

“Greetings, Fleet Commander. It has come to my attention that you are garnering quite a bit of attention and acclamation in the diplomatic orbit,” he said, grinning at her as if he meant it as some sort of honor instead of an insult.

Grionc masked her disdain with a practiced diplomatic smile. She replied, “It’s a pleasure to meet you too, Ambassador. I’m here because we need your help.”

The ambassador’s expression changed from a grin of faint amusement to a scowl of barely disguised annoyance.

Ignoring his discomfort, Grionc took a deep breath and began to explain the situation. The Malgeir Navy needed ships, she explained. It needed technology that was promised to the Malgeir months ago. It needs faster, stronger ships. It needed spacers. And yes, at the end of the day, it needed raw resources that they were now short on because of the war.

The ambassador listened attentively but said nothing as Grionc pleaded.

Prinlaex listened, his face an impassive mask. Then, when she was done, he replied in full diplomatic monotone, “We acknowledge and respect the significance of this request and will provide our response as expeditiously as possible. As you may be aware, due to the importance of safeguarding Schpriss space, a thorough examination of both your suggestion and our own security must be conducted prior to any potential decision regarding assistance for those outside our borders. We hope you can understand the necessity of this process.”

No, she did not understand. The Schpriss were next on the Znosians’ list. There was no way they didn’t know that… Maybe they were planning on just giving up if that ever happened, rather living on their bellies than dying on their paws. Not that the Grass Eaters were even going to allow them their preferred choice…

Grionc had been to Schpriss Prime twice before. It was a beautiful ecumenopolis, a city planet. The food there had been compatible with Malgeir biology and entirely made of meat, like a proper civilized race. And if it weren’t for her experience there, she could have sworn the Schpriss were a prey species the way they folded in the face of adversity…

Ambassador Prinlaex continued, “However, I have been authorized to extend an offer to you. This one is of a more personal nature—”

“A personal offer?” she echoed suspiciously.

“We have seen the impressive manner in which you lead Sixth Fleet and would like to extend to you an invitation to join our Schpriss Navy as a high-ranking officer, should Malgeiru fall. We are happy to provide a safe passage out for yourself and those under your command following the event.”

Grionc stiffened even more. “You’re asking me to commit treason!”

“Certainly not,” the greasy ambassador waved. “We merely provide an opportunity for you to find refuge and new purpose within our Navy, should the unfortunate event of a total collapse occur in your Navy.”

“Ah, not treason, just desertion then. This war is not over yet, Ambassador! We still hold dozens of sectors, and our capital is still guarded by the most powerful Home Fleet.”

“With all due respect, Fleet Commander, the evidence points to an unfavorable outcome for your forces. Keep in mind that I do get reports of the war that haven’t been edited by your government’s censors. For example, we know your offensive in Datsot did not go as smoothly as has been claimed in your Defense Ministry’s press releases. And please… Home Fleet. Even you can see how absurd placing your faith on them is.”

“And what will you be having me do for this **favor**?” she asked angrily.

“Nothing much. We would like you to provide us with updates and insights from time to time. We are friendly neighbors, after all. This is simply an effort to ensure that we remain in the loop and can share beneficial knowledge with one another. And of course, when the inevitable does come to pass and Malgeiru falls,” Prinlaex continued with unwavering confidence in his morbid prediction, “we would request that you transfer as many remaining Malgeir and Granti ships to Schpriss Prime as possible.”

_Oh, not just desertion either. Espionage too. Fantastic._

She was coming up with an appropriately indignant retort when he interrupted the simmering rage in her heart.

“I do not need an answer now. I encourage you to go home and carefully ponder your decision. You have a great deal of talent, and I would hate to see you squander it in a conflict where the outcome is, unfortunately, not in your favor. I suggest taking some time to consider all of your options before making a final decision.”

He was barely done talking before Grionc stormed out of the room and building.

---

After the conversation with the repulsive Schpriss ambassador, the first thing Grionc did was to take a long shower to wash off his stink. The second thing she did was to look up the Oengro’s contacts directory for her tactical officer’s information. He had a reputation among the ship’s senior officers for being resourceful, which she would need.

Which is why Grionc was sitting nervously on the park bench, looking around furtively like a contraband trader with a guilty conscience.

“Hello, Fleet Commander,” Speinfoent said as he awkwardly approached her bench.

“Sit, sit,” she said hastily, “How was your leave? Did you visit your pack?”

“No, my parents were both on Gionlu. They didn’t get out before the Znosians overran it.”

“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that,” she said genuinely.

“It was months ago,” he shrugged, “I like to think they would have been proud of what I’m doing.”

“Is that why you joined the Navy? I saw your aptitude scores. You could have gotten into any of the prestigious research institutes for a cushy, well-paying job or—”

“Gionlu fell after I joined up. And you’re thinking of the old Navy, Fleet Commander. Nowadays, we frontline officers are getting pretty good recruiting offers too since the Defense Ministry’s gotten desperate,” Speinfoent grinned, then continued more seriously. “I do want to help prevent what happened to Gionlu from happening to other colonies, though. Call it a sense of duty or… whatever.”

“I understand,” she said simply.

Speinfoent looked over at her solemn expression and instantly believed its genuineness. Grionc had that effect on people. “What about you, Fleet Commander, why did you join up?”

“I was a migrant worker on Grantor. When the war came to the Granti, they were our hosts and allies. It was just natural that many of us enlisted or were commissioned. My first position when I was an omega leader was staffing the tactical station of a small Granti gun cutter,” she recalled with a slight smile.

“You were in Tactical?!” Speinfoent exclaimed. “I guess I’ve never thought of you as anything but in command of the Sixth.”

“Yeah, we all had to start somewhere. Pretty soon after that, the Malgeir officially joined the fight, so we transferred over. That’s when I got my first ship command: a tiny Omega-class ship. We all thought the war would be over quickly. A few months, maybe a year. I remember a discussion on the news where xenobiology experts kept saying the Znosians were a prey species, so they had to be bad at fighting.”

“Must have been a shock to see one of them in battle in person for the first time.”

“Yeah, nah. We figured that one out pretty quick. Back in the day, the censorship wasn’t quite as strong. And then I truly got a taste of it the first time my ship got boarded—”

Speinfoent’s eyes went round and asked, “You’ve even seen a Znosian boarding party?”

“Oh yeah. We relied pretty heavily on close ranged ship-to-ship weaponry early on because we didn’t have much else, and they took advantage of that. The Omega-class I was on got boarded by a small elite squad, just five or six of them… We didn’t have any Marines. They chewed through half our crew and got to the fusion reactor room, and we had to abandon ship.” Grionc shuddered at the memory. “Less than a dozen of us got out.”

“Ah, my condolences, Fleet Commander,” he said.

She nodded her appreciation. “The news kept repeating the same line ‘prey can’t fight’, ‘prey can’t fight’ for a while after. Then, the official line became, ‘they only win because they breed a lot of them’.”

“That’s… not wrong. There are a lot of them. Endless waves of them.”

She snorted. “Yeah, but we’d probably be in trouble even if we fought them one-to-one, too.”

“No doubt. What a cosmic joke. Who knew the only prey species to get to the stars would be so combative and unreasonable?”

Grionc found herself nodding in agreement. “Yeah. It makes sense though, doesn’t it? Intelligent species that originated as predator species learn to only expand as much as there was enough food and learned to make the best use of the resources we got. But prey… in nature, they just grow and grow and grow until they eat all the foliage and then starve. That’s probably why the Grass Eaters are the way they are, except there’s plenty of us left for them to graze on. And the selection bias: I imagine a species of prey less inclined to constant violence wouldn’t make it to the stars in the first place!”

Speinfoent nodded slowly as he tried to digest her hypotheses. He was kind enough not to point out the fatal flaw he immediately picked up in the first one: some of the non-sapient predators in their own people’s history did that as well.

They sat in awkward silence for another moment until Speinfoent spoke up. “Why did you want to talk to me today?” Then he hesitated and asked, “Are we… planning a coup?”

“A what? Coup? No! Where did you even learn that word?”

“Ancient History class.”

“Don’t lie to me, Speinfoent.”

“Yeah, okay, it was an old movie I watched. And besides, you know the whole Sixth Fleet will back you if you do, right?”

“Speinfoent. We’re not launching a coup,” she insisted, putting as much sincerity into her voice as she could. “What makes you even say that?!”

“I just thought… you can certainly do a better job running the war than the cretins in the Defense Ministry. Commander Vastae asked us—”

“Wait, Vastae’s mentioned a coup before?!”

“N—no…” Speinfoent said hurriedly, “Nothing of the sort. He just made us dig out the remote hard locks on Oengro’s control systems that Home Fleet built in decades ago… just in case Home Fleet is ever compromised.”

Grionc narrowed her eyes. “I see. And did Vastae mention how Home Fleet could be a potential threat, given it hasn’t seen battle in over nine hundred years?”

“It’s just a precaution,” Speinfoent replied, averting her eyes. “Anyway, if it isn’t a coup, what did you need me here for that we can’t talk about on our communicators?”

She thought for a while and answered, “They made me talk to the Schpriss Ambassador.”

“Those slimy cretins. Are they finally sending the ships they promised months ago now?”

“No. Same answer, we’ll need to investigate it, blah blah blah. Then, this time, he tried to poach me to the Schpriss Navy ‘when Malgeiru falls’, as long as I pass them information,” she said, curling her lips and claws at the outraged memory.

“And… you want to know what I think?”

“I already know what I’m going to do, but what **do** you think?”

“I think it’s a good deal. But I would personally rather die a Malgeir than live as a Schprissian coward, hiding behind my neighbors as they fall in battle to a xenocidal enemy.”

Grionc thought for a second and nodded. “That’s what I would have said to him right then and there if I didn’t care about tossing my career over nothing.”

“Are you going to report him?”

She barked a short, sarcastic chuckle. “To whom? The Home Fleet internal security commandant? I bet he’s already bought his own tickets to Schpriss Prime. Besides, their ambassador has diplomatic immunity or something.”

Speinfoent shrugged. “Well, at least that means a few of the Malgeir will live on, for a while. Until our ostensible friends discover the bottomless appetite of the Grass Eaters.”

“Speaking of the aliens,” she said, shifting. “What did you think about that Znosian prisoner’s talk of another species out there?”

“It seemed genuine, and the rest of the interrogation checked out, but it was all based on rumors and conjecture. It could just be prey ramblings.” Speinfoent then added, “They mentioned that these new aliens are silent protectors, but when—”

“But when did they protect us, right?” Grionc continued his question. “I had a thought about that, too. What if a Znosian raiding party found a star system that belonged to this unknown alien species on their way to attack us, and they got wiped out by them? Some kind of territorial reaction by a new species out there. Repeat that a couple of times, and their prey mentality start to see a pattern where there is none.”

“That’s as logical as any explanation I’ve heard so far. I wonder who would have been able to not just go toe-to-toe with them but beat them so hard that they didn’t even get a full picture of the threat.”

“That is precisely why I am curious. If the Znosians suffered a major defeat somewhere, there must be evidence. Some kind of anomaly. Maybe a few missing ships between two battles. Or an anticipated raid that never happened. Or something like that. Speinfoent, that’s why I asked you here. I need you to investigate this for me.”

He didn’t even hesitate. “Yes, ma’am. I assume we can’t just go through the official channels?”

Grionc shook her ears. “No. If this is true, there’s too much riding on this. The Defense Ministry has given up, like a wild old animal with cancer, waiting to die. I reported this days ago, but I wager it will be months before anyone even looks at the request. If they even bother.”

“I see. I will try to get access to the Archives and see what I can find. I might have a way in.”

“Stay safe, Speinfoent,” Grionc cautioned. “The Defense Ministry… it might be dying, but the vultures are not. Its Archives are not a safe place for honest creatures. It might even be more dangerous than any battle we’ve been in. If you see something you know you shouldn’t, don’t dig too deep unless you have to, and let me know as soon as you find anything.”

The Human Artificial Hivemind Part 479: Proof Of Life,"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/rtrcwb/the_human_artificial_hivemind_part_1_malfunction/) [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1axoaxr/the_human_artificial_hivemind_part_478_abduction/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_human_artificial_hivemind#wiki_the_human_artificial_hivemind)

Dilandekar stood before his people, staring down his rivals. The massive great hall's pillars rose high above them all and were carved with the likenesses of great Knowers from the recent and ancient past. The metal, stone, and concrete were all built and poured by Knower paws and hauled from Knower forges, as was proper for their central hub of governance.

The Grand Laboratory hosted tens of thousands of rooms, each with specialized connections to minimize contamination, along with an outer shell of classrooms that educated the entire city's children. In this grand central chamber, surrounded by all the High Researchers, with the most prominent opponents closest to the middle, he stood alone. He had a series of documents and holograms to present the direct impact he had on the Knower population and their relations with the Alliance.

He also had detailed notes he'd read on his opposing candidates, as this would likely continue to pose as an informal debate that was streamed across the planet and likely to others. Knowers were above the shouting matches that some other governing bodies came to. Dilandekar himself had never yelled at his opponents, which was a point of pride.

A Researcher shouldn't have to batter their opponent down to dust with the loudness of their voice. Instead, it should be the power of their arguments and the undeniable truth of logic that made their enemies succumb. His opponents had adhered to much the same, which he was glad for. If he were to be replaced, the Knowers would still have a person of culture and respectability in charge of them.

They'd presented their latest arguments against his position as World Researcher, some of which held more merit than others. The High Researchers were clad in simple traditional clothes, sporting symbols of their fields of study on white coverings. Trinilakadar, the High Researcher standing against him, lashed his tail against the stone.

""Yes, it is true that the Alliance did impose itself upon us,"" he said. ""I make no move to deny that. But to present that argument without context is to compare a Knower to a skull. An oversimplification of a complex narrative into a simple one will inevitably mean the loss of crucial reasoning.

My opponent's stance of the Alliance being a conquering force may hold some merit. I do not believe so. I believe that they helped us when the Wisselen came down to massacre our people and finally mended the ancient relationship between us and the people now known as the Junyli. Yes, we are flooded with human ideology, culture, and phrases. But we are not a conquered people.

We build our own ships with our own labor and send our people out into the stars. We don't lease our spaceports. We own the ultimate rights to the star system and all of the land within it. Our infant mortality rate has plummeted to almost zero. We can eat more foods and gain far more nutrients even from our most basic fungus farms now that the Alliance has helped us. We have monorails, better guns, and the internet.

Clean fusion power plants, nuclear bomb production facilities, and a robust school system are already the second most capable in the Alliance, behind only that of the DMO on Mercury in the Sol system. We have improved in every metric, even in social cohesion, as has been shown in studies time and time again.""

""We are slaves to alien masters.""

""Are we? Tell me, what purpose would arming us with weapons better suited for resistance serve for them? Why would they let us maintain our own independent military, economy, schools, workforce, and nuclear arsenal? A benevolent conquering nation would not do that by choice. A hostile nation would not, either. So, the simple argument is that they do not think we will attack them. The complex argument is that they care for us, do not want us to go to war, and continue to strive to help us,"" Dilandekar said.

He took a breath. ""And as the World Researcher, I have protected us from those hostile elements of the Alliance, and forced them from the negotiating table with their tails tucked and their heads low. I brought the anti-trust lawsuit against the Development Corporation. I helped to ensure that our traditions remained taught in our schools despite the transition to online and virtual reality learning. Our children are so much smarter than us, that calling them Knowers would be insufficient to describe the Knowledge they hold.""

""And what about the attack on the Known World, Dilandekar? Why could we do nothing against it?"" Trinilakadar asked.

""Because the Sprilnav are the primeval species in this galaxy of ours. We could have had a military ten times the size of the Alliance, and it would only have been a bigger battle. We might not have won. We do have projects in the works to help get stealth detection technology to where it needs to be, but as always, such drastic measures take time.""

""Perhaps we can let the Knowers decide who will lead them?""

""Do you mean a full vote?""

""Exactly."" His enemy seemed quite happy. And while only Dilandekar had the unique ability to smile due to his war injuries to his skull, he knew the other Knower was quite proud of what he'd done. He had slowly maneuvered Dilandekar into this position. He'd read the poll numbers, the same as Dilandekar had. But the problem was that this election if it was to happen as such, would not go how he expected.

Dilandekar had prepared some tricks for him.

Luke sat on the floor of the cell. He knew that Leia was close by, but not exactly how close. The shield suddenly flickered. A thin line emerged inside it, and the cuffs on his arms released themselves. He saw an Elder stride into the cell. They'd mercifully left his visor on, though he had no communication with Command since entering the Elders' main ship. The fighters had transported them directly to the other one, which likely meant that the attempted destruction would be called off for a time. It was a brilliant idea, he had to admit.

And he respected it, if only because the enemy was willing to abide by sensible rules of war. If the opportunity presented itself for him to get to freedom, he would take it no matter what. But the Sprilnav had been incredibly meticulous.

""So,"" Elder Manil Van said. His jaw looked to be healing at a decent rate. It was incredible to see, especially if it was without medicine.

Luke didn't respond.

""I presume you think I am here to interrogate you,"" the Sprilnav continued. ""Who you work for, who sent you, how they were able to coordinate the attack so well, how they were able to knock out the communications, and all of that. And were I the Elder piloting the ship you destroyed, I would have, along with a hefty amount of torture. Your mind remains unspoiled, as do your companions.""

""Say what you wish, and then leave.""

""So he speaks! How wonderful. Now, I presume you still will be suspicious of me. You can remain here in your cell, or we can try and figure this out. You captured me, and didn't kill me when you had the chance to spite me. Why?""

Luke pondered the question for a short time. And then he pondered what to say if he wanted to say anything at all.

""I believe that your Alliance wants to pretend it is the good side in a righteous war. You are, in your perspective, freedom fighters, arming yourselves in response to Sprilnav oppression and imperialism. Of course, to some, you may be seen in a much more negative light, even if we ignore Penny's Judgment situation. You see, I have had a conversation with the Elder who runs this ship, and the one who runs my family. And we agree that your deaths serve less purpose than your lives. And though you may be loath to admit it, you do have a sense of honor, as do I. We are the same.""

Luke almost didn't roll his eyes at the poor attempt at a cliche. Almost.

""Ah, I see you dislike that comment. Alright. We aren't the same. I'm red with four arms and three-quarters of a jaw, and you're... pinkish, I think? Or maybe brown, like some humans I've seen in your videos. Fascinating breadth of colors your species has, really. I'm going to give you an opportunity to endear yourself to my crew, and myself.

Now, you may be asking why. The simple answer is that the Van family does not see the point in direct fighting with the Alliance. We came to collect an asset, which your capture has provided a direct path to. Though really, there was nothing you could do after. Your ship just didn't have the engines to outrun our fighters, though you might have made it a bit further if Brey was able to get to you in time and knock out the psychic suppressors keeping her from teleporting you out.""

Manil grinned as much as he could with that missing portion of his jaw. ""You see, human, you are the greatest of their soldiers. And I would like to know how you measure up to me in other ways, besides just height and color.""

""And why should I bother to do anything you say?""

""You have no reason to. I'm not giving you an order. You could stay in your cell, or we could play a few games. Tests of agility and strength, perhaps. Low-stakes games that humans play.""

""I want to understand what you are saying, Elder. You are claiming that you will allow us to be free on your ship, and all I have to do is play games with you? Even though we are, as you claim, prisoners of war, and such an action would be incredibly stupid on your part?""

""Yes. We know your ranges of motion from the battle, and they are similar to mine. This is something more cultural.""

""Explain.""

""Well, you spared my life,"" Manil said. ""You and the others. You did not have to, and that fascinates me. What kind of quality do you have to have, in order to risk yourselves for an enemy you don't even know? I owe you a life debt, as does the Van family. It is something we take seriously. Of course, we take other values seriously, so the Alliance won't know of this until the trade has been completed. But if they do this right, you may have an ally in the future.""

""Elders with honor,"" Luke mused.

""A rare sight in your part of the galaxy, I am sure. It will be a few days until we can get a secure contact with the Alliance, so we'll keep you comfortable. Ask for food and water when you need it. There will be no attempts at interrogation on my watch. But do not abuse my debt to you, soldier. If you attempt to run, you will find things much more difficult. I am extending a helping claw instead of a cutting one. We have blast doors thick enough that we can afford this.

No matter how fast you can run, you're not getting out of here by force, even if you're made of antimatter. As a courtesy and gesture of my sincerity, I will place you with the others, and you may discuss my proposal, or more likely a futile plan of escape. Just know that we do intend to trade you off for an asset the Alliance is likely to give up in exchange. Hopefully, there will be no further misunderstandings about the Van family in the Alliance when we are finished here. We truly want to fix this before things turn for the worse.""

He seemed to be oddly fine with the hundreds of thousands of Sprilnav who'd died on the ship. Luke assumed it was just a lack of care for those who weren't considered 'strong' in this case. He did have a few soldiers who'd been diplomats, though. He'd discuss the next steps with them before he did anything else.

Elder Spentha gave the Elder across from him a flat look.

""You want me to negotiate the release of human super soldiers in exchange for an Elder?""

""Yes, we believe that is what we told you, around thirty pulses ago. Should we repeat it for you?""

""No. I would just like to understand why you are negotiating.""

""The Patriarch does not wish for war with the Alliance. He sent his ships following an Elder's unfortunate capture. But since the Elder is claimed to still be alive, then we would like him back.""

""Why not just break him out of jail?""

""We don't know where his jail is, and we don't want to get the Zelisloa treatment.""

The Elder said it so casually.

""That is deeply disrespectful.""

""He died like pitiful vermin. What else is there to say?""

Spentha sighed, unwilling to have this argument.

""We will pay you for it, and remove many of your legal troubles for you if you indulge us. You are known to the Alliance, and have not been killed. If you are, we have people more valuable who would not die in your place.""

""You are quite candid about what you think will happen.""

""Yes. We know you will agree, and there is no reason for distrust between us on this. If you sabotage the negotiations, we will kill your children and deliver their heads to your ship. In addition to the grief you might feel, you would be unable to avoid the Elder Councils by the loophole you exploited.""

""Having children before the Source war is not a loophole,"" Spentha argued. ""It is the result of my handsome stature and my remarkable skills with females.""

""So remarkable that you do not have a mate by your side, Elder?""

""I have been *busy* with other things.""

""I am sure. Virtual reality isn't going to make you feel better in the long run, though.""

""I fail to see how insulting me will bring you any closer to getting your Elder back. And I would also ask the real reason why you are not attacking the humans.""

""They have shown the capability to attack Sprilnav installations with impunity. Using Kashaunta, they could direct Penny, who is the most devastating alien weapon to cross the borders of Sprilnav space since the last Purge, to seek out our locations. We will see a demonstration of her abilities when she hunts the gangs on Justicar. But for now, we do not wish for that level of involvement.""

""You are afraid.""

""In the same way you would wish to avoid stepping on a nail. We 'fear' pain, not destruction.""

""Then why do you care so much about them? Is it Kashaunta?""

""She may do as she wills.""

Spentha figured that the truth was somewhere in the middle. The Van family didn't want a lot of drama, suggesting they weren't a very large power. If they did have some ships, it wouldn't be many. The Alliance had detonated a Sprilnav ship with a powerful antimatter bomb for their level of development.

""Why did you open the hull?""

""The fool who opened the hull is also responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths, and has been struck from the family records for his stupidity. It is why we do not hold so much animosity toward the Alliance. Had their bomb been delivered to its initial target, it would have still crippled the ship.""

""Did any Elders die?""

""Two bounty hunters. Trash, basically. However, one of our people was captured by the Alliance, and was treated relatively well. Of course, when we captured them, we took him back and freed him. We will be leaving their supervision up to him, but not without some outside monitoring. But that is beside the point. We need you to help us, and you will.""

""Lovely. Do you plan on asking anything from the Alliance besides the Elder who has been captured?""

""We will see.""

Elder Gattica stood up when he saw the hivemind approach him. ""What is it?"" he asked.

""Are you actually called Khayaka?""

""I suppose that was my name, a long time ago.""

""Well, your family is requesting for you to come back.""

""So the Van family did come for me, then,"" he mused. ""I assume there was a dramatic battle?""

""Yes. We blew up a ship, and briefly captured an Elder named Manil Van.""

He was surprised at that. Manil was a talented warrior, for sure. Or at least he had been. But to fall to humans was certainly a new low. Gattica thought about the situation he was in. He needed to be useful after he got home. He'd been seen as a liability otherwise.

The Alliance might also try to use him for additional leverage if he wasn't careful. He had been trying to move on from the mess with Yasihaut, but it didn't seem that would happen.

""It is quite lucky for you that you didn't kill me, then,"" Gattica said.

""The potential value of Elders is one of the main reasons we keep you alive if it is feasible,"" the hivemind agreed. ""Sadly, it wasn't for two of them this time. I do have to warn you against attempting to rile up your family against the Alliance, however.""

""I know. I can't say I'm sad to leave this place. To put it bluntly, your food sucks, and your drinks are nasty.""

""We did ask you for suggestions on how to improve them.""

""Which I answered.""

""I don't know how many of those fruits would taste, and neither does any Alliance citizen, with the very possible exception of Penny Balica. By the way, I also hope that you do not sabotage her, either.""

""I do not plan on it,"" Gattica said. ""I'm going to get my father to cut ties with Yasihaut. I'm done with all of this. My debt is paid. Respectfully, I never want to see you again. Well... considering my situation? Disrespectfully, you can-""

Gattica proceeded to give the hivemind a very vulgar description of what exactly it could do. In the end, both of them were finding it increasingly difficult not to smile.

""Ah. Perhaps we may miss you.""

""You too, inferior barbarian.""

Gattica turned to stare at the portal next to him. He walked through, ready to resume his new and better life once again. And then he emerged in another concrete room. Brey was standing inside it, wearing a golden dress overlaid with armor on her shoulders and arms.

""Oops,"" Brey said. ""Sorry about that...""

A new portal opened. He glared at her all the way through. He emerged on a space station, where the hivemind, Brey, Gaia, Phoebe, and several Alliance diplomats were sitting behind a black table with documents in their hands and paws. On the other side was an Elder, along with several other Elders who seemed related to him.

""I am Elder Spentha,"" the main Elder said. ""I am glad to see you have survived, Elder Khayaka.""

""Elder Gattica, actually.""

""That's just your name with a Fifth Outer Regional New Age Chetapleken Planetary accent,"" Spentha sighed. ""I suppose they are cut off from public Sprilnav networks, which is why Phoebe didn't have them on file. But, respectfully, *are you kidding me?""*

""I dislike your tone,"" Gattica said.

""We're not doing this,"" the hivemind said, rolling its eyes. ""You can have your dramatic duel over your pride later. Spentha, you have seen the Elder is alive and well and is not a hologram. You claim to be negotiating on behalf of the Van family, to which he belongs, correct?""

""I am. I do not 'claim to be' in any way.""

""Can we trust that our words are being delivered to your clients, who likely are in contact with the implant in your head?""

""Yes,"" Spentha said. ""You may. They would like to express their appreciation for the lack of bruises on Gattica's skin, as well as their displeasure of his accent. But that is not what we are here to discuss. The talk of the day is prisoners. Gattica is yours. Your super soldiers are ours.""

""Elder Gattica,"" Gattica clarified. Spentha glared at him.

""Most esteemed supreme lord over all Sprilnav of the moons, skies, and seas, ruler of the snack closets, and Elder of the Van family, Gattica. My apologies for neglecting to mention your titles. Are there any that I have missed, King, God Emperor, President, Monarch?""

Spentha's voice dripped with disdain.

""You are-""

""Elders, *please,* not here,"" the hivemind sighed. ""We are willing to exchange Elder Gattica for our soldiers, as well as a diplomatic post within the holdings of the Van family which is actually paid attention to.""

""And why would you require such a thing?""

""In case we wish to have more allies among the Sprilnav. And in case they wish to have allies as well.""

""And what makes you think that the Van family requires allies?""

""Because Yasihaut was able to strongarm you into sending one of your own into the dark void for her own whims, where he very easily could have died. As a direct response, you sent an invasion force into the Alliance, which is a full act of war, fired on Alliance ships, and lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the ensuing counterattack. I do not think our future recourses here should be more war, when you value the lives of your family so much but also send them into the battles you fight. You have lost one of your own, which we offer condolences for.""

""He is not one of them,"" Spentha said. ""They have made that very clear.""

""I see. In addition, I believe that we have both bloodied our noses enough. A war with the Alliance would likely cost you many lives, and would cost us many lives, and we have no reason for further conflict.""

""And how exactly do you plan on keeping Yasihaut from pushing on us anymore?"" Gattica asked.  
""If we are not able to kill her, we will continue to stymie her at every turn. Currently, we have an opportunity to help one of her allies turned enemies, and you might be able to get aid from Elder Kashaunta if we request it.""

""She would not do that for free.""

""She would, if it goes against the goals of her rivals. Yasihaut is a figurehead of her rivals for sure, but still represents them enough that anything that hurts her also hurts them. Kashaunta opposes the Status Quo Party, just as your own family does, if recent records are accurate. We can be a trio of allies.""

""And what of your own allies? The Cawlarians and the Vinarii?""

""The Vinarii are dysfunctional, and matter less and less to us,"" the hivemind said. ""The Cawlarians recognize the value of a novel strategy, which is attempting to befriend more moral Sprilnav groups.""

""But that has happened in the past.""

""Not at this level. Kashaunta is one of the most powerful Sprilnav to have ever lived in politics and economics. Her support of the Alliance speaks far more than a thousand weaker micro nations.""

""A weaker micro nation is exactly what we are,"" Gattica said.

""Yes. That is why the deal would be beneficial to you. You would benefit greatly from the protection Kashaunta provides and would not be a target of her enemies due to the fact that she has other more prosperous powers which are more poorly defended nearer to her enemies' borders.""

""And notably, Kashaunta is not present in this discussion, which seems to hinge on her support,"" Spentha said. ""Perhaps you should have planned that better.""

""We can involve her if you wish it right now. She told us to make our plan without her presence for now. But either way, the benefit to your nation of even being in her thoughts is large enough. Plus, we are on our way to being in a position to help you soon enough if you require it.""

""With what ships?""

""It is not about the ships, but the speeding space drives,"" Phoebe said. ""I have been able to locate certain speeding space theoretical mathematics formulas that are very interesting. While we can't make neutronium hulls, our weapons are quite capable. As are our soldiers, who were able to successfully destroy one of your own ships. We were able to equal you in military combat, which does suggest that our assistance can be of use to you.""

""Until you are destroyed.""

""Staving off destruction is one of the primary functions of both a living being and a civilization. We are not going to be destroyed as easily as some might think.""

""We have heard tales of your mobilization, AI. But that does not mean we would be so free with our aid and designs.""

""You do not have to send us designs. We already have them. We can send you designs which are better optimized for Sprilnav operation and are better performance overall.""

""Except for weapons systems and hulls.""

""Your hulls are not made in single sheets, but are pushed together with high amounts of power, pressure, and heat. Your weapons used similar principles to Mercury-class guns, but on a somewhat smaller scale. Some of those weapons, such as zero-point energy and particle beams, are under active study. I believe we will be able to crack the secret.""

If Phoebe was willing to reveal that, what did that mean about what they still kept secret? Did they really think Spentha wouldn't be compromised in any way? Zero-point energy was difficult to harvest by its very nature. Many nations were entirely unable to utilize it. Sure, they hadn't gotten a leg up from Kashaunta or by hacking general Sprilnav networks, but it didn't make sense to Gattica why they'd say that.

Perhaps they wanted to seem intimidating. But without Elders, they had no hope of power projection when it was required. Zero-point energy beams were basically just weapons that fired incredibly powerful lasers with special quantum effects that would multiply their energy by ripping it from the vacuum of space itself.

The problem was making sure that it stayed in a beam and didn't turn into anything else, which usually required a core of specialized, complex particles that Gattica hadn't understood at all, even with tireless study under a professor with an Eonic degree, who had admitted himself that he barely understood.

Spentha tilted his head to listen to his implants.

""They would be interested in signing an official agreement, but they will be coming to draft it. Here is what they have told me:

'We will send over diplomats, who we will not rescue if they are captured, or bargain for if they are imprisoned, but we will never deal with you again and will seek to oppose you in the Judgments when we can. If we do not come to an agreement, and there is no hostile action on your part toward our diplomats our our ships when we pick them up, we may be open to additional negotiations.

The Patriarch has decided that the drawbacks of the Sol Alliance as an ally are equal to the risks on their own. However, he also would require the full assent of Elder Kashaunta before any direct agreement can be signed, and the denial of this assent will change its nature. He would also like the Alliance to issue an apology for the lives lost in the battle that just happened within fifty Earth years, with the period allocated due to the... discomfort losing sides of battles often have.

He would also like a single sample of Phoebe's promised designs, which will be in a format capable of being downloaded, compressed, scanned by antivirus software, and copied if necessary. Note that any attack through this program on the computer systems of the family, from espionage to digital warfare, will also result in the withdrawal of all treaties and agreements signed.

Furthermore, he will want three members of every species in the Alliance, along with whatever additional caretaking staff they may require, to inhabit a diplomatic station to be constructed in his territory. These individuals will be allowed to return to the Alliance if relations break down.'

Now, you don't have to agree to every one of these conditions, but the Patriarch would look more favorably upon you the more you do agree to, and would ask you to explain in full your reasoning for the terms you decline. He also would like one Vinarii and one Cawlarian official present for any official signatures to forestall any unpleasant eventualities. He knows the reputation of the Sprilnav within alien space and does not wish to have people curse the Van name.""

""You have a great many conditions,"" Brey said. ""May I assume there is a reason the Patriarch or his officials are not here either in person or holographic form?""

""Phoebe is the reason,"" Spentha said. ""The rules against AIs exist for a reason.""

Remarkably, Phoebe didn't react at all. To Gattica, it was as if she was a statue. She was good at emotional control. Gattica did wonder if Nuush was still alive. If so, he wondered if he was still a useless bartender at some sleazy restaurant. To the Van family's surprise, he'd managed to stay there for many megapulses, claiming that it 'wasn't a phase' and all that.

Gattica looked back at Elder Spentha again as they continued to talk. The other Elders didn't do or say anything. Absolute children.

""Well, I must say that we are glad you have considered our requests,"" the hivemind said. ""May we be shown a video of our captured people?""

Spentha placed down a small device, which showed a hologram. Gattica assumed it was connected to an isolated network, which would be deleted and rebooted before any further use.

On the hologram, it showed a human with considerable arm muscles gripping the claws of an Elder with a smile. Both their elbows were on a short table below them. The Elder was smiling as well, as much as he could, with the right part of his lower jaw missing. A nub on that area showed that it was slowly growing back, though. Eventually, the man's bulging muscles moved very slightly. The vein present on his forehead vanished, and he slowly pushed the Elder's arm down onto the table.

A crowd of Sprilnav gathered around them began to laugh. Oddly enough, Spentha didn't look upset. And neither did the hivemind.

""What is that?"" Gattica asked.

""One of our super soldiers beating an Elder in an arm wrestling contest, just barely,"" the hivemind said.

""The Elder in the video is the same Elder who was a prisoner of war, and treated rather nicely during his brief time as one,"" Spentha said. ""Though I don't understand how this kind of contest would be proof of anything.""

""Consider that Luke there couldn't access the hivemind or its psychic energy,"" Gaia said. ""What do you think that means about the quality of our soldiers? About the quality of humans when they do have access to the hivemind? If I have not laid out the situation thoroughly enough, then I am sure that the future will. We don't need to have a war. It is better to have an ally than an enemy, no matter what they look like.""",1b05d2d,83,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1b05d2d/the_human_artificial_hivemind_part_479_proof_of/,"[""Remember how languages have accents that develop over time, as cultures separate and age?

Future patch suggestions for Starlo/Adjusted Starlo dialogue and events (DANGER: HYPER(?) CRINGE AT THE START. THIS ARTICLE IS ALSO VERY LONG),"My man Starlo would **NEVER** do that shit **PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE** fix him Undertale Yellow devs 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I'm DESPERATE at this point

Genocide:

* After evacuating everyone, he sees Clover and attempts to shoot them (to protect the evacuated monsters)
* Clover shoots first, but Ceroba takes the bullet
* Since the attack was so sudden, Ceroba's guard is down and thus dies
* Ceroba tells Starlo to get the hell out of here. Maybe she talks about if Starlo got shot and killed, she'd have nothing left? But since she's the one dying, he'll live?
* MAYBE she'd give her staff to Starlo as a goodbye gift and/or extra protection?
* Starlo thanks her for playing along all these years and reaches for her hand. She grasps it as she turns to dust
* Filled with anguish and rage, he initiates the battle. The song theme could be called Executing Aim (executing is an adjective here)
* If Ceroba gives him her staff, MAYBE Starlo could combine the staff and his gun to create a badass shotgun
* 2 phases. MAYBE the Feisty Four join the battle
* Genocide-exclusive fatal-sprite has bullet holes, like this: [bh](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndertaleYellow/comments/1auftm9/if_genocide_death_sprites_in_undertale_had_gashes/)

Neutral/Pacifist:

* idea: [ae](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndertaleYellow/comments/18x12ut/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_that_starlo/)
* he probably wouldn't imprison your Momlet and kidnap you 💀💀💀
* You tell Starlo you want to leave.
* Starlo doesn't want you to leave, because
   * he doesn't want you to die to Asgore or any other Royal Guards, especially since:
      * you're also a cowboy
      * you're just a kid
      * you're a human (he's crazy about humans)
      * you're his DEPUTY
      * you're his child :(
   * he'd having nothing left. No friends, no crush, no reputation, no deputy...
* so he attacks you to protect you/get you to surrender. He even says that you don't even have to be a deputy anymore: just stay in the Wild East.
* He tries to get you to only 3 HP, but due to his recklessness, he'll always kill you. His expression changes when he kills you
* He probably mentions how everyone will miss you if you die?
* He's not used to violently losing a kid figure, so he's desperate. His desperation intensifies as time passes
   * He still uses the lasso at the start
   * about 75% through the duel, he wells up in frustration
   * Also about 75% through the duel, his attacks become more disorganized and impulsive, switching between \[being difficult to dodge and being easy to dodge\]. The switches are random but are similar to an AB AB pattern. The disorganization also intensifies as time passes
* If killed, he says that he always figured he was incompetent. ""How could anyone think I was cut up for the job?"" He asks you to tell his parents that he'll be gone for a while.
* His attacks' disorganization reaches its zenith at the very end, and they stop.
* Checking him at the end: Starlo - ATK 0 DEF 0 - A nobody.
* Sparing him switches the game to overworld-mode. He throws his gun off the platform.
* He laments that no matter how hard he tries, he can't do anything meaningfully good. He asks you if he was a bad mentor to you
* You have the option to hug him (this doesn't affect his friendliness)
* If you don't hug him, Ceroba comes over and comforts Starlo instead
* His apology is more sincere

He eventually comes to terms that he can't control big issues, and that he should instead focus on the reasonably-sized issues of his friends first. He tells you that you can always come back to town if you want to.

&#x200B;

Flawed Pacifist:

* He says that he understands why you had to kill Ceroba: it was in self-defence against a strong enemy
* However, he says that he can't bear being around \[another loved one that'll die soon\], so he leaves
* He tells you he regrets not having convinced you enough to stay in the Dunes",1b0598d,5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UndertaleYellow/comments/1b0598d/future_patch_suggestions_for_starloadjusted/,"[""The only changes I'd make off the top of my head would be:\n\n* Giving you the opportunity to abort the murder route after letting him shoot you with the fake gun;\n* Adding more meaningful ACTs to his battle in general (same for all other boss battles);\n* Adding an ACT to shoot off his hat in the main battle, that involves making an attack with a very high degree of accuracy required, replacing or complementing the current way to defeat him.

Agent Isiah Welsh has died and been resurrected by the Herbert west serum, and given a new life as AGENT FRANK. Agent AUGUSTUS, a buff former marine is brought in to replace the currently injured Agent Vincente Peron, who is in the hospital from wounds sustained earlier in the operation. Also brought in quietly, is EPA agent Samuel Laine, a shy, young gay man (something I only found out later as it wasn't on their sheet) with significant experience in the Wilderness. He is brought in to replace Agent Lila Garcita.

# A Cold Reception

1206 Spooner Avenue waits for their return, cold, dark and at night, singing. During this time, the players for Stan Jacobs & Gary Herschel were absent, and offscreen their agents had begun to dig into the history of the house on their own. Agents Augustus, ""Frank"" and Laine go to the house on their own,this time at night as they arrived late. Initially, they had just planned to look around, but Augustus had visited the house earlier in the day on his own, without entering, and had become *Obsessed* with the house,if not possessed. That's right, the special operator is corrupted and the other two agents are being led into the house. The razor, the axe, smashed windows and all of the damage from earlier still lingers.

&#x200B;

The trio enters and encounters a few small manifestations such as the child in the door, but they are lured into the living room by the sound of the wood chopping as Augustus stalks off, and finds the axe. He enters the room with the axe, taking a swing at Isiah, landing it firmly into Frank's collar,and he crumples. Everyone quickly realizes what's going on. Another swing of the Axe goes at Sam,who dodges it over the couch. Words are exchanged,guns are drawn,when suddenly a music box can be heard from the distant mirror room. For a normal agent,the fireaxe through his collar would be fatal,but as Augustus is distracted,he gets up, proving himself to be a resurrected corpse and shocking Augustus. Frank uses this as leverage to talk to Augustus, weaving a beautiful tragic narrative about how they had seen the other side and ""the house wants you, don't you feel it?"". Augustus buys it hook,line & sinker and places his sidearm on the couch,entering the mirror room with the axe placed at the door. He watches,seeing the figure flirting out of his vision,hints of wonderous sights in the space between...before Augustus notices something hovering in front of his throat in the mirror. The straight razor.

&#x200B;

Both the player,and Augustus seem to have made the same mistake: Believing that the house has friends,that the house has allies,that he was in any way different from the others who have entered the house on 1206 Spooner Avenue since it's creation. He sees the Witch in the mirror for only a moment,as the razor is drawn across his throat and then dropped to the floor. Her hands letting go,the smile fading as she turns away,the slick blade dropped from her fingers like a candy wrapper. {Break} This would have killed most Agents,the attack critted and Augustus was bleeding from his throat,knocked down to 4 HP. But Augustus was a beefcake, a mountain of a man who took a moment to recover as he stood back up. He heard Sam & Frank trying to leave, turned,and clutching his bleeding throat with one hand,fetched the Axe from the floor. And he charged them. Helped to walk by Sam,Frank raised his sidearm (actually Augustus' gun from the couch) with his one good arm and shot Augustus in the stomach. The damage was incredibly lucky,knocking Augustus to 1 hit point and knocking them unconscious. The cops came, attracted by the gunshot, Frank's injuries were condealed, the police chief having been briefed to some degree by the other agents earlier helps to cover up the whole affair. It's just another strange incident at the house on 1206 Spooner Ave,after all. Augustus,now in a coma,as sent to a Hospital in state,and to be restrained. Frank,due to the extent of the injuries,is recalled to March Tech for repair,and leaves the operation entirely. {Break} {new chapter}

# It's not Over...

Stan Jacobs and Gary Herschel learn about this shortly afterward. They get serious and make contact with Elizabeth Tucker,the attractive antiques dealer who helps the agents discover the house's missing furniture. (for reference, Stan Jacobs is a man who looks purpose built to fade into a crowd,while Gary Herschel is a skinny, 6 foot 3 dark skinned man with a head & beard of bright orange hair) The Agents had noticed sections of dust or indents in the floor of the house earlier from where the furniture had been. They acquire the furniture after several days of work and discover the diary,and the ritual knife. And finally,they understand what happened to the house, it's consecration, understanding the involvement of the dark man, the ghosts,and how many souls must be trapped still in that home. At this point,through a lucky surgery and several days of rest, agent Vicente Peron has recovered enough to re-enter service. During his time in the Hospital,Vicente receives a frantic phone call from his wife saying she received a frantic call from him. The address on the caller ID was 1206 Spooner Ave. He panics and tells her not to accept any calls The house is reaching out. It's showing them what it can do,that it can reach them outside of the house. Something needs to be done and soon.

# Getting Serious

The group goes over the journal and figures out how to twist the ritual into a Dismissal for the entity controlling the house. This is the first time the players have had to really look at the rules for casting rituals,and one of the agents with the lowest Sanity (Vincente Peron, or Samuel Laine, it's hard to recall but I think it was Vincente) will be the one to initiate the ritual, although they will all be in some way participating. Vincente Peron has recently gained several points of POW up to I believe 18 due to his consecration to Nyarlathotep after the result of the prior opera in San Francisco ( The Consecration of Vincente Peron  in Part 4 of the Recap) goes ahead as the one to donate POW. To make the players more likely to go through with it, I allowed them to recognize that the ritual *can* be done without a human sacrifice, but at a heft -40% penalty, and it will still require the POW investment. Vincente Peron will take 2 points of POW, the other being taken from Samuel Laine. Of course, Vincente's compulsion forces him to grab hold of the diary the second he can, which raises eyebrows but he's been through a lot. The Agents prepare their weapons, make their peace with the friendly, and head for 1206 Spooner Ave.

# The Night Ritual

The Agents make their way in, and thankfully, little happens. At this point the House has used up much of it's accumulated Willpower, but the Agents regardless, are quite terrified as they enter the house. They enter the Master Bedroom. They prepare the bowl and the knife, and ready themselves to start the dismissal, when Stan Jacobs notices he has notifications his phone: Several voicemails he has failed to answer. Recent.

Since the house called Vincente Peron's wife, the agents had silenced their phones. As he's staring at it, as Vincente Peron and Sam are chanting, he gets a call from the same number: Police Chief Michael Buffington. He picks up, frantic and the first words he hears are ""Augustus has broken out."" 

In the full sized window, lit against the light of the full moon is the buff, buck naked shape of Agent Augustus, in his eyes nothing remains of himself. The Agents see him right before Augustus smashes the window with a broken piece of pipe and forces his way through the window covered in broken glass. Something is beginning to form, a presence from the darkest shadows in the corner of the room. The screaming starts, and Sam and Vincente try to focus on the ritual, Herschel and Stan draw their weapons and start trying to shoot. Vincente Peron notices the shape begin to form from the dark, the knife drawn across his wrist to give his investment. Behind Stan he can see the form of Isabelle Wheeler, laughing, screaming at them from within the mirrored walls. Other forms seem to hide behind frames, watching, almost as if afraid. Gary Herschel's Desert eagle finds his mark in Augustus' side and he collapses, unconscious but not quite dead. The body is slid over to Vincente who raises the knife, shaking and plunges it into Augustus' chest. The shape's form is concrete, and it steps out into the shadows. A man with skin so dark it seems to absorb all light, a head too long, a body too slender, naked aside for a long purple sash covered in something reflective which twinkles like stars. A thing not of this world. Herschel loses his shit and collapses, staring in awe. Stan also drops to his knees. It speaks with a voice which seems to come from within their own heads:  


# ""Who Calls me?""

The figure approaches Vincente Peron, arms outstretched, staring into his eyes, the dark man's own eyes contain nebula. Samuel Laine is the only one who holds it together, continuing to chant the memorized ritual over and over and over. The figure reaches to embrace Vincente Peron, who is frozen in fear, its lips about to close in on his... and Sam finishes the chant, screaming the final syllable. There is a moment where the visions of all present goes black for a second  as if there is a frame missing in the footage, the scream of an old woman from so very far away, ... and the dark figure is gone.

Light for Dummies.,"

First of all - grapple doesnt exist. Its bad, its lame and if you think otherwise - think again.


Then think again about playing light. From around 1.5-1 seconds of reaction window you drop it to around 0.5 seconds. 

If you want to deal damage - heavy can do it much more reliably, while offering powerful utilities like bubble and mesh shield. If you want to be useful to your team - medimedium. 
Defibs is like a kill but backwards, heal beam turns your teammates into almost unkillable annihilation machines. If you think that youre smarter than everyone else - welcome to our freakshow! 

Now lets think how you gonna play. Dash turns into a powerful get-out-of-jail-for-free card, if you of course can react fast enough.

Cloak is a bit more complicated, since its not a ""press one button to not die"", Im looking at you mesh shield. One more downside of cloak - it kinda sucks compared to vanish bomb.

Instead of zooming around, being able to dodge bullets and just being much more annoying to the enemy - youre a sad, slow frenchman. That dies really quick. 

So yeah, dash vanish is your base loadout.

Now lets get to weapons, about which im extremely biased, since im a console player. Guns for me are just not viable after AA nerf, idk how im supposed to move my thumb with such micromovements to reliably control recoil. 

My first ""main"" weapon was db. AA really carried there, also it was pre-nerf. Nowadays youll barely see any db users, the gun itself is way too much of a risk, for same reward. Use it to either stomp other lights or to flank and ""backstab"". Feeling of taking down a heavy in two precise shots between cheeks is just too good to pass on! 5/10. 

After that, we have V9S ""MOST OP WEAPON IN THE GAME"". It really wasnt, but people just love complaining about every part of light class, so lets give them a reason to! Its basically a disguised lmg, since lower firerate and a solid magazine size combine into a deadly and sustainable damage output. Works much better on longer ranges, although iron sights take some time to get used to. 7/10. 

Sword. SWORD. SWOOOORD. Yes baby, you just hit jackpot! Best weapon in the game, just use your ancestral knowledge and go nuts! Giant hit connect window, solid lunge, COMBOS and so on. Dream come true for a scrub like me; just be sneaky, be fast and any, and i mean ANY 1v1 will be closer to bullying, than a fair fight. Your main 2 problems are other lights and flamethrower heavies. 10/10.

MP5 is just a better M11, works best in a 20m range. 8/10.

Other weapons are lame or self explanatory. (throwing knives are bad)

 And now gadgets. Stungun is like defibs for medium or RPG for heavy. Hide behind a wall and wait for someone to try your cashout, cancel rpgs, nukes, camp dead bodies, be as cancer as you can. 10/10.

Vanish bomb is too good to pass on, fully cloaked team can easily penetrate enemy defences, turrets are practically a joke and you can instathrow it when rescued to get out of any sticky situations. 10/10.

GLITCH Grenade is lame and boring, anyone whos saying otherwise is probably lame and boring too. 3/10.

Frag on the other hand does its job flawlessly. Drop it on cashouts to destroy landmines(instead of disabling them lol) or kill stealers, open fights for more reliable kills and drop it under your feet if someone thinks they can catch up. 9/10.

Other gadgets i just dont use that much to give a good explanation. Key to surviving as a light is to wait for your teammates to open fights, using your gadgets first, staying together and flanking if you have enough time.

It works the same as the tazer but you can affect multiple people, it lasts way longer and it also affects shields, turrets and mines.

Alternatively you would have to shoot the mines or throw a frag like you do but it that case you\'ll either move the cashout to a possibly disadvantageous position or you\'ll trigger gas which wasts crucial time.

It\'s not bullet proof. If they are persistent they can just climb over and finish us off but most people just ignore the random goo wall.\n* I do something similar in buildings. Grab statue, run up the first flight of stairs and goo the entrance.\n* There are some spots in the game where the cashout room is next to the outer walls of the building. In such cases you can create sneaky perch spots with goo to hide outside and just below the windows to the cashout room. It needs to be a low traffic area so something like Seoul hospital. They\'ll never see you and once the alarm rings you\'re one vault away from the stopping the theft.\n* More obvious scenarios like creating makeshift cover in open areas or as makeshift cover to close distance to a firing opponent.', 'Dude tried to talk about lights but immediately dissed grapple, making everything else he said inconsequential']"

&#x200B;

Can choose any gun & any 2 secondary gadgets in the game  


C4, claymore, proximity alarm & deployable shield are removed. Bulletproof camera EMP disabled. Gonne-6 has more bullets & is a secondary gadget   


Barricade needs 2 hits to be destroyed  


When operator throws a gadget he can still use a gun   


When operator is injured, he can shoot back with a secondary  


Drones are bigger (not as Twitch's one) but faster & has higher jumps  


Shotguns are slower with lesser dmg  


Flashbang effect is slightly longer  


New running animations  


Any operator can pick a shield (like old recruit). Blitz & Montagne can use machine pistols  


Red pings are disabled. Yellow ones can't be placed by dead teammates  


Planting, defusing, walking & shields are noiseless, but running doesn't  


A headshot requires 2-3 shots (stupid, but random headshot is bullshit)  


When using cameras, drones, defusing & planting operator can watch around (not fullscreen) & trigger gadgets  


Can replace reticle on any scope  


New underbarrel attachment: soft breach grenade launcher that works like Zofia's one  


New secondary gadget: noisemaker grenade, fake frag grenade  


All operators are 2 speed  


New scopes from Rainbow Six Siege Mobile along with its other features: scopes on pistols, underbarrel launchers, ADS reload 

&#x200B;

  


Operator reworks (not all):  


Sledge. Throws a sticky breaching device that creates multiple flashbang effect on the other side  


Thatcher. Drones that can shoot with an EMP (like a bulletproof cam), which disables devices completely  


Smoke. Same gadget but when operator is in gas, controls are reversed (move left button becomes right, etc) and vision darkens  


Mute. Same gadget but its throwable & must be triggered manually. It disables devices for 5s  


Thermite. Incendiary grenades  


Ash. Launches sticky projectile that can be triggered to release flashbang grenades   


Castle. Same gadget but it covers only lower part   


Pulse (can be attacker). Corner cam   


Twitch. Same gadget but now drone has double jump. If it shoots at camera, instead of destroying it, all defenders cameras disable for 10s  


Doc. No syringes. Gives teammates med packs. They can heal anytime but can't revive themselves. When Doc is alive, injured teammates last longer & crawl faster   


Rook. Instead of armor, gives teammates helmets with face shield, that lowers FOV but protects from the headshot (no need for models, can be a UI filter). Will crack with time like Clash's shield making FOV worse  


Jager. ADS must be reloaded manually. Can be done by teammates  


Wamai. Magnet must be triggered manually   


IQ. Same gadget but its a visor, like Jackal's one. When she marks the gadget, its permanent for all team  


Glaz. Same gadget but he also has a launcher with blue smoke grenades  


Fuze. Same gadget but its throwable, sticky, much faster, with lesser dmg  


Kapkan. Same gadget, but instead of explosion, Kapkan gets a notification. When he is in the camera mode, there is a mark of triggered trap that is visible only to him  


Frost. Same gadget but attacker can't move (sitting is possible) for 5s, then he is freed & can't run for 5s   


Capitao. Same gadget but he has more bolts, cycles them much faster & there are regular bolts loaded, if enemy will come close  


Caveira. Interrogation removed, pistol damage nerfed. She needs to shoot at 2 different attackers with a tracker. Then all of their cameras are revealed to defenders  


Blackbeard. Throwawble gadget that creates wide shield & controlled as a drone (it can be folded to move through small space)  


Jackal/Solis. Visor with cameras that can be cycled in real time  


Ying. Instead of blinding - Candela deafens, & only defenders. It doesn't have charge, can be triggered in the air & has higher velocity when reflects from the wall  


Lesion. Same gadget but trigger is noiseless & cans are visible. It covers screen in spots for some time  


Zofia. Drones that can heal & revive teammates   


Ela. Noiseless mine triggers. Attacker starts to make squishy footsteps that can't be heard by defenders, but he leaves footprints  


Lion. Small flying drones that can hover in the air & move through drone holes  


Maestro. Throwable gadget that automatically reinforces the wall  


Alibi. Same gadget but instead of revealing, it imitates shooting & direction of fire  


Clash becomes an attacker & her shield doesn't deal dmg  


Nomad. Same gadget but knockback is bigger, it deals dmg upon bumping into the wall & has a flashbang effect  


Gridlock. Shield (like Clash's, maybe bigger) that jamms defenders electronics & can't be used with a gun. But it can be mounted, so Gridlock can use her guns  


Mozzie (can be attacker). Sticky cameras that can jump from wall to wall & crawl  


Nokk. HEL works as original one (she can't be seen on cameras). Nokk can place a noiseless alarm that upon triggering will make HEL change color. When HEL is activated she can't trigger defenders electronic gadget  


Amaru. Same gadget but it can also pull a huge piece of unreinforced wall, destroy a barricade/shield & get her to ledges  


Iana. Same gadget but its a throwable device that controlled as a drone. Also it imitates shooting  


Zero. Same gadget but smaller, with noiseless mount. It can imitate running sound & emit lound noise for some time  


Melusi (can be attacker). Banshee creates a zone, outside of which sounds can't be heard   


Aruni. Same gadget but it doesn't deal dmg. When there is hole in the wall or a barricade, gate works as a chameleon to cover those holes  


Flores. Much faster drones, no timer, can ride on walls  


Thorn. ""Bouncing Betty"" kind of mine that creates a flashbang effect  


Azami becomes an attacker & her barriers can be destroyed with 5 bullets  


Brava. Same gadget plus she can use teammate's ""body cams"" (like spectator). To hack, she marks a gadget to the teammate, so he can point on them  


Fenrir. Same gadget but it creates purple smoke screen for some time ",1b045ln,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RainbowSixSiege/comments/1b045ln/rainbow_six_siege_rework/,"['So you say you want the game to be more balanced and then your very first point is “let anyone choose any gun in the game” 😂 \n\nI instantly knew this wasn’t a legitimate post', 'No', 'Alone your first two points make the entire system of ""Operators"" worthless.

Struggling with information,"I own a 2002 Jeep Liberty limited, its my first car, and I would love to make it better at off-roading.

All I'm looking for are larger tires, a front and rear bumper, skid plates, and a potential suspension/body lift.

After going through a few forums however, the information from all of them starts to sound convoluted.  If you lift your liberty to much then your cv axles, ball joint, and upper control arm are all at risk. If you don't want a lift the biggest tires stock you can get are 245/70/16, but they may rub because the suspension in the springs wears down over time. Most people don't recommend body lifts and I don't understand why. Getting tires over 31.5 makes the car sluggish and not be able to engage overdrive on hills, and to fix this you would need to regear the differentials.

All of this may not be right this was just from skimming and looking through this page and a jeep forum. If this is wrong please feel free to correct me and offer help/links to sites that actually supply parts for an 02-07 liberty. Thank you!

If you were to up-gun the suspension with higher grade shocks and struts would that help anything?

Should I file a complaint against an officer?,"Situation: 

My Father-in-law was drinking last night when me and my wife had our kids over there visiting him. Now he is a drinker and in the past this has never been an issue. However, last night one of his ex's came over and after awhile they got into an argument, and she decided that she had enough and walked home and my wife walked with her so she wasn't on her own at 2AM in the morning.  

While my wife was walking this girl home my Father-in-law started getting agitated and said something along the lines of ,""If that bitch comes back around here I'm going to fuck her up."" I decided it was time for me and my kids to leave and while packing my things me and my wife's 15 year-old sister heard him load a magazine into his gun and cock it. My wife's sister went into the room and started crying and told her dad that if he unloaded the gun she would stay at his house, and I heard him say, ""If you leave I will use this gun."" At this point I decided to call 911 and involve the police in this situation, because originally I was just going to leave and let bygones be bygones but the minute he had pulled the gun out with a 15, 2, and 3 year old in the house I decided it was time for police intervention. Before the police could arrive my wife got back and saw her dad yelling at her sister, and she decided to step in between them and tell him to stop and that he shouldn't be guilty tripping his daughter into staying at his house, in response my Father-in-law raised his hand and slapped her and pushed her out of the way.

Whenever the police arrived they did their thing and this took approximately 45 minutes give or take a few minutes. There were three sheriff's deputies, as well one city cop that responded to the incident. Two of the sheriff's deputies were relatively new, and one was a sergeant. The city cop was a corporal. During the initial investigation my Father-in-law admitted to being in possession of firearms, and that while one wasn't fired during the incident one was involved in one way or another. After doing their thing we were told we were good to go. 

Before we left we asked what was happening with my Father-in-law and the sheriff's deputy told us they weren't doing anything beyond assisting the city cop in taking our statements of the incident. We asked why he wasn't being arrested for his actions and the fact that he threatened to kill two people during the course of this incident and had the means to do so, and also assaulted his daughter during the situation. When we asked this, the Sheriff's deputy then decided that he was going to turn questions over to the city cop. Whenever we started talking to the city cop he stated he wasn't doing anything at that time beyond taking the statements. We asked why my Father-in-law wasn't being arrested for what he had done, and he said he couldn't arrest him until the DA filed charges. Me and my wife then brought up the fact that he had threatened to kill someone else, and also threatened to kill himself, and askes what could be done to temporarily take control of his weapons so he wouldn't harm himself or someone else as he had threatened. Or at the very least take his safe key so he wouldn't be able to kill himself or someone else as he had said he would. 

The officer said he wasn't going to be doing anything beyond what he had already done, and after a minute of getting nowhere with him I asked for him to get his supervisor out there or at the very least on the phone because the Sheriff's deputy sergeant decided that he was leaving and that the city cop should handle everything else. Keep in mind this city cop is only a Corporal. The officer then told us that he was the supervisor, and I asked, ""So you're telling me that you're the current chief of police and that there isn't a Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, or even a Captain on Duty that we can speak to?"" He responded saying that the Chief of Police was currently in the hospital for surgery recovery, and that the Deputy Chief was on vacation and that he was the only person in the department currently on duty. I found this very suspicious because I am in a town of just under 6,000 citizens that directly borders a city of just over 23,000 citizens. My question for advice is what should I do about this whole situation, and should I file a complaint against this officer for blatantly lying to us and refusing to do what a ordinary person would assume is his job?

The worst ways to die on Runeterra - All 167 Champions listed,"As a casual Evelynn enjoyer, listening her voicelines while playing her makes me sometimes think how horrendous it would be to meet lore accurate Evelynn irl. That thought made me think further, if you would be living on Runeterra as a normal human (not magical, undead, Iceborn etc), what would be the worst way to die assuming you can get killed by every champion?

&#x200B;

**Few important things:**

&#x200B;

* I tried to list all champions based on their lore accurate capabilities, but some champions have no lore. They are listed based on their known in-game abilities and are marked as ""**(No lore)**"".

&#x200B;

* Some champions are myths or beyond normal humans reach. Let's assume you can meet anyone regardless of their whereabouts.

&#x200B;

* Some champions are peaceful and will hardly find any reason to be hostile towards someone. Let's pretend everyone are hostile and their only goal is to kill you, should they meet you.

&#x200B;

* This is all subjective depending on how you look at it. Feel free to comment your thoughts, I'd like to read them.

&#x200B;

**Here are the key factors defining this list:**

&#x200B;

* How much pain the death will inflict
* How long will it take to die
* Possible things that occur after the death

&#x200B;

1. **Evelynn** \- No doubt the worst way to die is by Evelynn's hands; your warm thought of a good time with an extremely attractive individual suddenly fades away, as you realize what nightmarish situation you've gotten yourself into. She subjects you to an unspeakable pain with her sharp claws, spikes and lashers. This slow, agonizing torture session might include being flayed alive, eyes ripped off, etc. Her torturing tools ain't nothing too fancy, but she is The Demon of Pain and Agony, and instinctively knows how to make you suffer the worst way possible before you die. She will squeeze every last drop of pain from you, relishing every moment of it.

&#x200B;

2. **Thresh** \- Sadistic Wraith who kills you slowly with his scythe, rips your soul out of your body trapping it in his lantern where you suffer untold horrors until you become his enslaved thrall.

&#x200B;

3. **Mordekaiser** \- Big bonk by the Nightfall and you're going to Brazil. Eternal servitude in Mitna Rachnun, the Death Realm. There you are bound to his will and he can torment and twist your spirit into whatever shape and purpose he desires.

&#x200B;

4. **Lissandra** \- She can enslave you, freeze your limbs and dismember you, impale you with ice and freeze your wounds so you won't quickly bleed to death. She can freeze you to death and turn you into an obedient thrall. She can also forcefully put you back to sleep and entomb you in ice, keeping you half-dead frozen while she enters your dreams and manipulate them and eventually feeds them to the Watchers.

&#x200B;

5. **Zyra** \- She can trap you with her vines and infect you with the spores of her plants and make the plants grow inside of you. You would face slow agonizing death as you watch plants burst and bloom from your body.

&#x200B;

6. **Malzahar** \- He can force you to see terrible visions that break your mind and drives you insane, causing massive psychic pain. You'd likely be on the verge of a suicide. Then he sacrifices you to Bel'Veth's Lavender sea.

&#x200B;

7. **LeBlanc** \- She can mind control you to kill yourself in a slow and horrible way or puts you in a situation where you are brutally killed.

&#x200B;

8. **Viego** \- He can dominate your mind and body with black mist and force you to kill yourself.

&#x200B;

9. **Singed** \- He will likely use you as a test subject in one of his sick experiments. The amount of pain and time of suffering may vary.

&#x200B;

10. **Urgot** \- He can impale you with a chem drill and meatgrind you.

&#x200B;

11. **Vladimir** \- He is capable to manipulate your flesh and blood to his desire with hemomancy. He can suck you dry.

&#x200B;

12. **Sona** \- She can create sound blasts, possibly deafen you and make you dance so hard your bones will break. Then you keep dancing until you die.

&#x200B;

13. **Varus** \- He might painfully torture you to death with his bow and arrows and revels doing so, but the more time he spends with Valmar and Kai, the more sane he becomes.

&#x200B;

14. **Fiddlesticks** \- Fiddle has an enormous psychological factor; Fear. The Demon of Fear instinctively knows your fears and will fill you with pure terror, making sure you are as scared as you can possibly be before you die. Then it drains your life essence and slaughter you with whatever parts the scarecrow puppet currently consists of or have within reach, such as saw blades or scrap metal.

Illuminate speculation,"I know I'm the minority but the Illuminates were my favorite faction in the first game so I am eagerly awaiting their or their successor's debut in the new galactic war. A great thing about this game is that each faction provides a distinct experience from one another, so here I am trying to predict what fighting the next faction will be like.

Bugs are a typical swarm enemy that consists mostly of armored fighters trying to close the distance so that they may rip you to shreds. Bots and cyborgs are closer to humans and will match our guns and artillery with their own. The Illuminates are meant to be alien and perhaps mysterious with their fancy tech. Their gimmick was control and indirect fighting. Invisible scouts that call the alarm and hide so that the event always knows where you are, snipers that one shot you from off screen, sudden walls manifesting to split your squad, psychic attacks to stun or mess up your controls. The Illuminates did not want a fair fight.

With all that in mind, I am quite sure that fighting the third faction may end up being a deadly game of hide and seek. Players will need to constantly be on the look out for invisible scouts and assassins (hope you enjoyed fighting stalkers). The snipers from the first game were easy to deal with because they don't adjust their aim but, now that we're in a 3d environment and don't share a screen, they'll definitely keep tracking you so that your only options are to kill them or break like of sight before they fire. Mind control in the first game was annoying but totally bearable in a 2d environment but I feel that inverting every control might be a bit much in 3d. Instead, I think mind control might feed into the hide and seek game this time around and cause hallucinations, either cloaking units that aren't already cloaked or making you see enemies that aren't there, maybe another faction. If it's still supposed to be mind control, then maybe your friends suddenly look like enemies and maybe the enemy looks like a friend. 

Of course, everything described above are the specialists and elite. I believe the the regular foot soldiers would be rarely seen until you lose the game of hide and seek. Suddenly, shielded taser bots are teleported to your location and they'll likely slow you like a targeted EMS if they catch you. I expect the Illuminates to have the most punishing reinforcement call if the three factions. Thankfully, there will be no armor but you gotta make sure to finish every event because their shields will recharge. 

The only thing I'm unsure of is the wall maker. Again, the first game's perspective was quite limiting so a sudden wall was devastating. But now, I feel like a simple wall would be too niche of an obstacle. Perhaps it will be replaced by another sorry enemy, one that will shield normally unshielded enemies. That way it still remains the barrier theme. 

Whatever form they take, I am excited show some alien scumbags that their fancy glow tech is far more effective in our hands than theirs. ",1b02wc8,6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b02wc8/illuminate_speculation/,['Walls would still be quite devastating even like this']
"I'm wanting to step back into short story work, I just have something here I would love for you to take a look at, and let me know where I can improve.","""How many... did I save?"", the words barely audible past the sounds of the yelling in the distance. I looked down at him, the floor turning a beautiful red as the EMT's put their lights on him. 

I turned to see the fires being doused and extinguished. Everyone seemingly knowing what to do and where to go. I thought they would of ran around in a panic. Behind them, past the medics, path the firefighters and the police; and even behind the remnants of the nearby people, they lay. Fenced off and behind a wall of improvised hazmat and what remained of the nearby police force. 

Some wall crumbing to a loud thud brought everyone's attention to the junction at the end of the street. The crack in the road that appeared, and the people it swallowed up and spat back out remained. 

We were nearby, walking past the book stores, looking at the coffee shops. I had been pestering him to buy me more books to add to my collection. It took days of begging, but I knew he'd take me. He promised me them on payday. We would step out on his lunch break, to peruse the street. See what I could convince him to buy, it was easy. Just like I knew he would take me to the stores, I knew he'd happily buy me stuff. 

We walked out of an antique book store, the bell ringed behind us as the heavy wood door shut. I admired me new collection held in my plastic bag when I looked to him and then to another store. He matched my gaze and grumbled. But before I even said a syllable, he has begun walking toward it.

The ground shook beneath my boots when I was suddenly jerked to the side, I looked and he had grabbed my puffy jacket and launched my across the road. Slamming into the floor I turned to yell at him. but he was not there. All that remained where he once was, is a hole. A scar into the earth as deep and damning as the depths of the ocean. 

I yelled, but it was lost in the choir of everyone else yelling. Rampant noise flooded into the hole as the sounds of sirens drowned us out. The flashing blue replaced all we could see. When the first paramedics and rescue crews arrived, they occasionally paused to look into the hole, but the unstable ground meant they couldn't look for long. 

I was the nearest to the crack when they showed up so I was one of the first questioned. I told them he was down there and to help them. To save him. They took his name, and as they walked off, I heard they mention quizzically about how many actually fell. 

A man with a drone in his hand ran to the crew. I saw them talk and take the controls. They flew it down to figure where the end was. They stuck a torch to it but I just curled into a ball. 

The more time passed that the drone went down, the more the rescue crews slowed. Until they stopped attaching the lowering winch. Then the screaming started, a woman kept screaming about her child. A college student about their friend. Everyone was screaming about someone. Then more sirens. A lone police car approached down the street at near fatal speeds and stopped abruptly. 

Two officers in heavy armour approached with guns. Everyone paused because this was not normal. Muttering of terrorism, or an attack spurred all around like a flood. 

They yelled for silence before asking to speak to someone... to Him. I yelled he fell down. They looked puzzled. They asked how I know him and I explained he's my partner. Tears began to form for the first time, I was never good with stress... but losing him like this... at all...

They asked if he spoke to me, but as I explained why we were in town my phone rang. I looked and apologised and saw his nickname. I started balling my eyes out as one of the officers took my phone and answered, he sling his gun over his chest when he asked hello. 

Faint, but the sound of his voice broke every scale of sound, nearly breaking my ears. It was his voice... but... why was he frantic. The officers looked at each other and turned to the observant people around the stab wound in the ground.

""GET BACK FROM THE HOLE NOW"" One demanded, the officer then turned to the rescue crew and ordered them to send the winch down to get any survivors out. The other officer took out a bundle of glow sticks from their car and snapped them all. A couple burst in his hands leaving them illuminated as he threw them into the hole. The lights all but vanished as they became no more than small green circles. 

The cable lowered into the hole as everything went quiet. In return for the gift of the winch, was returned a female voice screaming to get her out. One of the nearby men went hysterical screaming what I assume is the woman's name. Mallory or something. 

The rescue crew with the drone yelled for one of the officers. They ran over when once more, he screamed for everyone to get back... but this time he aimed his weapon at them. Everyone went berserk at this until he fired a shot into the sky. Then like a magic show, they obeyed like they were under hypnosis.

As the people from the hole came out, I didn't see him. I asked for him to each of the people but each one started crying. Paramedics arrived between the third rescue when... everyone stopped once the sixth person reached the top. Three gouges rested on their chest. They only whispered something to the paramedics before they yelled to the rescue crew that there is one more in the hole. 

Some people started yelling about how their family and friends weren't out yet. But then it yelled. He yelled. We could not discern who was who. Or what was what. The survivors cried hard. What caused them to be like this in this short amount of time I thought. As the winch started climbing higher and higher. My stomach reached my throat, then the heavens. 

He climbed out, but he looked far worst than any of the others. I ran, one of the officers tried to stop me but I wiggled past as he grabbed me. 

He slowly made his way to his feet. He looked at me, tears streaming down his face as he addressed the crowd. He hurt. More than I'd ever seen. He meekly said

""I..."" tears streamed. ""I tried to...""

Then the yell came from the hole again. He froze. The air turned to ice. The officers aimed their guns at the hole as he picked up a piece of metal rebar from some of the collapsed building. 

The officers yelled to the rescue crew, and to anyone able, to grab a weapon. Anything, or run as fast as they can. 

It was only moments later when we heard the cracking of rubble. getting closer out of the hole. Everyone ran, I hid. I watched as they poured out, the police taking out what they could, he stood swinging. The survivors were some of the only ones who did not run, yet were the only ones who did not grab a weapon. They hid behind him, like a god protecting their subjects.

When they climbed out... they looked like us but... not... One of the women near me gasped and cried into her hands, a man covering her mouth. The first one out the hole was wearing... cloths? It lunged at one of the rescue crew which blocked her with an axe, but he watcher its hands, he didnt know he had to watch its mouth.

It took a chunk out of his face as he screamed. A officer shot the thing as a paramedic ran to the man. The paramedic screaming as she yelled ""Something is in his face... I see things swimming in his eyes""

The rescue member screamed on the floor. His eyes turning a blood red as the paramedic sprinted away. Another came up and swing their axe down onto his chest, the gurgling slowly drowning out the screams of the man.

The gunfire was joined by more sirens, which were accompanies by more of those things coming out of the hole. 

He swing at one, smacking them over the head as it convulsed on the floor by his feet, he used the momentum to take out another one with a crunch to its ribs as it sputtered blood before stopping to move altogether. 

One of the officers shot one, but a second jumped on them, He ran over and smacked the creature of the head and helped the officer to his feat. 

As the sirens drew near, the things slowed down. It seems to have been a few altogether, the officers reloaded. The paramedics, rescue crew and volunteers all exhausted. He dropped to his knees as one of the officers caught him.

He wasn't the most athletic, but he held his ground against those things with athletes. 

I ran up as he looked nothing short of distraught. The fear on his face.

The blood pooling beneath him.

I wrapped him in my arms to comfort him, I was half his size, but I would be damned if I was not going to sound him in myself. He looked up. ""How many... did I save?"", the words barely audible past the sounds of the yelling in the distance. I looked down at him, the floor turning a beautiful red as the EMT's put their lights on him.

One of the survivors ran up and said... 7. One of the officers looked to the group huddled, watching him like zealots as he turned back and said ""I only count six""

The survivor who replied turned and said ""Not everyone made it out, but he made sure they didn't suffer. You... You saw those things""

Once the paramedics bandaged him, they tried to take him into an ambulance as some soldiers secured the area.

He stood up, leaning on my after being bandaged, which was already turning red. 

Then a scream came from the hole. Everyone turned to brace. The police raised their guns, the Military aimed and every stood. Suddenly. Some more emerged. Bolting toward us. They ran as a group, as the sides dropped dead from the gunfire, they got replaced by the middle ones. they moved like a swarm.

They approached us and launched myself, the the others to the side, dragging him by the leg toward the hole. Only the one who held him got away. I sat there. paralysed from fear. trying to find out what happened. The soldiers shot into the hole. And all that was hear... was his scream as it muffled from our ears.

Hardcore complete - parting thoughts,"Note: lengthy post you can skip reading all of it honestly lol just my thoughts.  Im not the best Hitman player but I have my moments and way of getting stuff done.  Yes I knocked out and organized all the suspects by meeting type and killed every assassin/lookout.

——

Now…my thoughts.

I love Hitman 3 or rather, the World of Assassination as a whole.  Completed these titles multiple times over (either as standalone titles or “within” the following game) and apart from frustrations doing the SA/SO Master Difficulty runs in Hitman 2 as well screwing up an elusive target here and there…it’s been the best experience I’ve had in the stealth genre.  As a huge Metal Gear Solid fan and a decent Splinter Cell fan…awarding it such an accolade is just my personal feelings on the matter.  Prior to it my favorite before it was MGSV due to the controls and vibe of that title…but these games have been a real treat.

That is…until Freelancer.  There was some appeal to it right out the bat - very interested in the Hitmansion and displaying all these guns in the basement.  Silent Assassin didn’t mean much anymore unless you wanted the objectives…and you were free to kill ANYONE that got in your way.  I remember my “kill everyone runs” from the past but…usually they were on casual difficulty (for good reason - getting to that in a sec).  I figured sure - if my plans go bad and I’ve got to shoot my way to victory I’ve got this.  Except…I didn’t have this, not for a bit.

I technically only failed four campaigns on my way to completing Hardcore.  I did fail missions along the way (10+ officially, 50-100+ utilizing the internet trick/closing the game fast enough) but I found that in my older age I don’t like to persist on something that is gruelingly infuriating (so after a fail I’d stop playing for a bit and come back fresh).  My fails were due to the gunplay in this game - this is NOT a game built for shootouts despite the wide selection of guns you can acquire.  Maybe if this was designed like Hitman Absolution (with the “marking” feature which I sorely miss) then it would be doable but that is not the case here.  Shootouts, especially as you progress through a campaign, become more and more deadly to be involved in.  The guards will not swarm you from one direction if there’s multiple access points to where you are - they will run around and come at you from another angle.  If you can’t find cover you’ll be dead before you know it…and that only leaves a small amount of time to pause, “shut off the internet” and quit to menu like the Elusive target trick.

I didn’t intentionally get into shootouts…it’s just some asshole NPC or other enforcer causing problems at the worst times.   I could be an hour in playing things carefully and bam - get screwed over by something.  That frustration led me to putting the game down A LOT since Freelancer dropped…but it’s only over the past month that I’ve found myself dedicated to completing 2 campaigns - one normal and one hardcore.  It took a while, with constant resets, to complete the first one but holy crap…Hardcore was something else.

First and foremost - more guards.  My very first mission was Colorado (I chose an Assassination syndicate because I needed it for one of those challenges)…and right away I noticed two extra guards on the roof below the water tower.  I had…trouble getting to a point where I could actually get down to where the Point Man hangs out and figured out along the way this mode operates on Master difficulty rules - can’t wear a disguise if you kill them with anything other than a neck snap/garrot (I found explosions, crushed by stuff, electricity, etc all ruined the disguise).  This in mind…I altered my play style from the normal campaign and would knock out at least one of each guard if it was a disguise I could make use of.  Colorado was perhaps the worst level to ever try in Hardcore simply due to how many guards swarm when a body is found.  I succeeded by using “peek-a-boo” tactics of killing as many guards as I could before they’d run after me then I hid in something until I had an opportunity for another kill or they returned to patrol routes (along with bagging up bodies).  After clearing what must have been half the map of enemies I began hunting down crates…to my dismay they were no longer marked on the map.  My initial frustration with that subsided as I moved through the mode…but it still sucks regardless.  Same deal with couriers…I’m glad the safes and suppliers were marked at least (though they’re always in the same place).  

I had a few close calls on my way to the final showdown but I was taking things a lot more cautiously than I did in normal mode.  Some missions were perfect - basically Silent Assassin but others turned into peekaboos when things went wrong.  Initially - I used Haven Island for the first two showdowns as it seemed to work out well the first one.  Second showdown…not so much.  For the last two I ended up with New York, which I could clear the entire basement and make use of it to lure suspects.  I made a habit of killing all the lookouts and assassins too to boost the Mastery score.  By the time I completed the final mission…I had a good understanding on how to handle each map in the mode but…it was still a very nerve wracking time.

I do not care for Freelancer’s punishing ways.  Normal mode was bad enough making you lose gear and some Merces on a mission…or your freelancer tools on a showdown along with the campaign.  Hours and hours spent gone - with nothing but maybe a few new guns on my wall to show for it.  With Hardcore every step had to be careful - one fail, even not completing a prestige objective, meant the end.  I wasn’t about to deal with a failure after finally reaching this mode so…Hardcore only took one attempt though I did have to do the internet resets to save my skin a few times.  After I completed it…I deactivated it right away.  I have no reason to ever play Hardcore again outside of it maybe causing the 50K merces loss challenge to pop?  From now on…when I return…it’ll be normal campaigns.

* As Diana said…I deserve a break.  I’ve stressed and stressed over this mode off and on for months.  I didn’t think I could ever do it simply due to the bs that can sometimes happen in this game but I managed.  All that’s left is the grind to 100 and all those undone challenges.  So…for now until the Undying returns I’m gonna finally take that break from Hitman.  If I can do it though…beat this Hardcore mode crap…anyone can.  Just use your best tactics…and if possible your Silent Assassin methods from the main game.  The extra enforcers and lookouts are a problem to be sure…so readjust as needed.",1b02fbh,23,2,https://v.redd.it/1j7uw4f8ftkc1,"[""That took you some retries, huh?\n\nPoint of advice - On a controller, don't try to aim at heads manually.

Batman Game,"Now that Rocksteady has moved on, what would you want to see from the next Batman game?

I'd want to keep the movement and combat of the Arkham games, but focus in on a single neighborhood, like The East End, Gotham docks, or Battergate. Maybe even a Dredd or Raid-style fight through a building.

Wherever it's set, I'd want to explore every room of every floor or building, like you could in Asylum. I'd also want both local and online multiplayer.

I'd also want to see different gadgets from what we got in Arkham. Keep the batarang, gas, and rope/grapnel gun, but maybe have a limited use net or bola, a sonic device for calling bats and stunning enemies, an EMP to blow out lights and cameras, and a lockpick. Make the gas regurgitant, tear, or knockout rather than a simple smokescreen.

Finally, make the game playable from three perspectives: the Bat-Family (Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing, Red Hood), the GCPD (Commissioner Gordon, Detective Bullock, Renee Montoya, Jason Bard), and morally grey (Catwoman, Huntress, Deathstroke, PI Riddler, Azrael). Maybe even have a limited character creator like DCUO, where you start with a hero template and mix and match costume elements to modify the hero, cop, or villain.

Putting all this together, have a singular threat like Poison Ivy, Mad Hatter, and/or Black Mask place a building, neighborhood, or site/complex under mind control, with all the residents acting as enemies, in addition to the villain's actual henchmen, the GCPD MCU (sent to stop them), and most of the Bat-Family. Batman spearheads an operation to stop them, backed by his proteges and the MCU as he frees them. Regular police cordon the area and generally act as backup, while outside parties try to take advantage of the situation. You play as one of the main three factions, unlocking characters and customizations as you go along.",1b02f8m,1,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/1b02f8m/batman_game/,"['Not exactly a batman game but a red hood game in the style of splinter cell conviction is my dream game.', ""If a new dev is taking it then it's going to be different.

Open world really doesn't add much of value in my opinion but if you're making it big enough for the batmobile to be a factor, actually use the batmobile like a car instead of a tank, transportation and chasing. Maybe make it more like LA noire with conducting actual investigations, talking to people, figuring it out and making the call based on what you find. Not just magically recreate a crime that feeds all the information to you. If it's a more close quarters game then on top of the initial things I mentioned about stealth and combat, allow more fluid use of throwing enemies, slamming them into the environment or through walls, charging, supplexing being part of your base control scheme along with hand and leg attacks so you can chain any of them together at any given moment. \n\nAlternatively the narrative can be more light with the game loop more of a roguelike mixed with nemesis system.

"Come & Share Your Stories, Ye Veterans of the Automaton Front","I am a veteran of a hundred battles and skirmishes with the wire-heads. 

I dropped into Vandalon when I knew nothing of war. Sweet Liberty, I was so young then. 

I was transferred away to face the Terminids on Turing and Errata Prime to earn my salt, but something inside me missed the cold, wet jungle. The red eyes in the dark that seemed to stare into your soul. It wasn't long before I found myself back facing the chrome-domes. 

Mantes. 

I lost a lot of good friends at Mantes. I must have seen a hundred airstrikes, a thousand bombardments and a million rounds shot. And too many good Helldivers lost to Meat Saws, Rockets and Kamikaze drones. 

Against my screaming body and mind to return back to the Bug front, where I wasn't getting shot at, I remained and I gritted my resolve. I learned, I adapted, and I persevered. 

I fought back, whether behind the controls of a mounted gun emplacement, or crawling through the muck and mud of the jungles. Whispering to myself, to prepare my muscles to burst with explosive energy as soon as I called in Eagle 1 on yet another fabricator. 

When Mantes was successfully liberated, whilst others cheered and celebrated, I only don my tattered, bloodied and shot cape to head off to Ingmar. 

Yet another bloody campaign, but this time I had better training, experience and weapons. I wasn't the hunted - no, I was the hunter now, blasting Devastators and Hulks. My first tank was a harrowing experience, but by Super Earth when I saw Eagle 1 dropping my first 500-kg on that blasted thing I cried tears of democracy. 

I was tutored, and then tutored those new to the threat. 

But there is only so much you can do when command sends you, time and time again to save yet another group of scientists stuck on this godforsaken rock. 

Officially, those 40 or 50 scientists were all that we came to rescue for. But unofficially, I've seen a pile of bodies, shrapnel-filled from our own mortars. I've come to hate their rhythmic 'thump-thump-thump'. I can still hear it now. 

I hated it. 

I hate those civilians, who couldn't run to save their own lives. But all must do their part for Super Earth, and if that means eating yet another rocket to save one more civilian, I would. 

If only to get off that bloody extraction point.

Ingmar stood at the end of the day, thanks to the countless sacrifices of a hundred thousand unnamed helldivers who dropped into hell without asking why, only knowing what they must do. Had to do. 

Yet as I take a temporary democratic breather, I see more attacks launched on defenseless worlds. Worse yet, I hear from my brothers at the Creek that commands is pulling them off that merciless world. 

I close my eyes, thinking of all the pain and suffering I had gone through over Mantes and Ingmar. 

I would love dearly to help them out. 

But my place, and my time is here at Mantes. At Popli IX and whichever world those metal machines decide to attack. To be the shield that protects Super Earth and her citizens.

A kinetic conundrum (MTAs) (VTM),"A friend and I had a discussion recently around the ability of a mage with Forces 2 where they can intensify or reduce the kinetics of an impact. 

In M20: How Do You Do That? pg. 30 it says ‘If the blow would normally inflict bashing damage, and the Forces Effects adds to that damage, then the damage also becomes lethal instead of bashing because it hits so much harder. If, for example, Khan bends physics to intensify a kick, and his player rolls four successes for that kick, then the opponent must try and soak five successes’ worth of lethal damage... if she can!’ 

This is not what’s up for debate. No, what my friend originally asked me was this, ‘Do you think that by using this ability a mage could make a vampire take lethal damage from a gun?’ (Admittedly I don’t remember the exact phrasing of the question but in the essence of what it asked is the same.) 

On pg. 281 of the V20 rulebook it says this ‘Against mortals, firearms are considered lethal damage. Versus vampires, firearms are considered bashing damage unless the head is targeted (see “Targeting,” p. 274), in which case the damage is considered lethal.’  

So I said ‘No, I don’t think that particular use of the forces sphere would make one of the kindred take lethal from a gun.’  

My reasoning being that firearms deal lethal damage already, the lethal damage that vampires take from said guns are usually considered bashing. 

He justified himself by saying ‘It would actually, because the mage would be turning the bashing damage they normally would be getting from the gun into lethal.’ 

So… you see the issue at hand. Am I crazy here? The reason I don’t think this would work is because this use of Forces is exerting control over things OUTSIDE of the party that’s being harmed by it. Transforming a punch into a lethal strike due to the sheer kinetic output of that strike being increased. 

A vampire taking bashing damage from guns in something inherent to their being, like soaking lethal damage. So how would this ability turn the bashing damage the lethal was converted into back into lethal? 

 I feel that in order to do something like this you’d need an effect that changes some fundamental aspect of the vampire, a Life+Matter effect maybe? 

Would love to get some outside opinions!",1b02c68,6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/1b02c68/a_kinetic_conundrum_mtas_vtm/,"[""From what I remember, Vampires consider gunshots only bashing because they don't need their organs, thus them getting hit is not that big of an deal.\n\nI don't think though speeding up a bullet would change much with that, atleast not to the degree Forces 2 can do.\n\nYou don't need to change the Vampire, you just need something with more punch. Forces 3 for example. Or Prime 3 / Forces 2 to make the bullets deal aggravated damage by infusing them with Quintessence / Primal Energy."", ""I have  bit of a cheat solution here. Instead of applying kinetic force to the whole projectile, apply it randomly to its mollecules - ie make the bullets glowing hot. That would definitely do **aggravated**, to a Cainite.\n\nIf you don't do that, you can justify the bashing to lethal like this: Instead of just aligning with their tranjectory, the Forces effects makes the bullets ricochet multiple times *within* the cainite, turning their effect from *just a few holes in a corpse* (bashing) to, effectively, swordcuts, which are lethal.\n\nIf you still won't assume it's lethal… hmm. Going by the standard effect, what you're doing with forces is effectively adding more velocity. I don't think that changes anything (unless you add enough to go relativistic, but let's not go there). \n\nIf you want to interpret RAW, and the only thing Forces does there is add velocity to the bullets, I think you're right because this is the order of operations:\n\nGun, does lethal -> Forces is applies to lethal -> Cainite experiences lethal from a gun source -> Cainite converts it to bashing.\n\nIf you want to cut the difference here, say it's still bashing but it's strong enough to no longer be halved by the undead body (the impact shatters bones)."", 'Nope.

The argument is the rote turns bashing to lethal, where vampires treat specific lethal as bashing.

See first statement."", 'Well, with Forces 2 you could convert the kinetic energy of the bullet into heat. It will travel less far but it will burn as hell. Melted metal should count as aggravated, right?', 'When dealing with Mages, it\'s all about how it\'s thought and expressed by the mage. Forget the rules. The Mage player can\'t just say ""i use force 2 to make my bullet lethal to vampire""  that\'s just game mechanics. The Mage player must clearly explain exactly what magick effect is being casted.\n\nIf the only effect used is to increase bullet velocity then as a Storyteller i would ask myself: if the vampire was shot by a high caliber high velocity bullet, like from a minigun, would it still be bashing or would it be lethal? The same rule apply, because the mage himself described it as ""increased velocity"".  If gunning a vampire with a minigun is still considered bashing then so would be the effect.\n\nBut forces 2 is an incredibly versatile sphere. There is a lot of ways to make it aggravated damage. It\'s all in the Mage description of what he willed exactly.']"

What is this screw for? ,"I was cleaning and oiling my bb pistol and noticed this little flat screw under the barrel. It's screwed into the metal above it and has a small spring that appears to feed into the hole it's threaded into. It's also floating almost exactly halfway between the top and bottom of the metal that enases it. I figured maybe a controls the hop up, but the barrel is one continuous tube with only a rubber gasket of one side to hold the bb and seal the chamber.

I'm racking my brain around it. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Beastialar (Cursed Spirit),"Grade: Special

Appearance: Beastialar most commonly appears as a towering figure, his form a grotesque fusion of human and beast. His body is covered in fur and scales, with green serpentine eyes. He sports a lion's mane, the arms of a tiger, ears of a bat and the muscular legs of a human. He wears makeshift armor crafted from the bones of humans and the remains of other cursed spirits.

Personality: Beastialar is cruel and ruthless, viewing all other beings, even fellow cursed spirits as inferior to himself. He delights in causing suffering and destruction, reveling in the chaos he creates. He is cunning and manipulative, using his powers to create discord and division among his enemies. Despite his bestial nature, Beastialar is intelligent and calculating, always seeking new ways to expand his dominion over the animal Kingdom and beyond. He also displays some social-darwinistic beliefs, believing that the world has always and always will be, survival of the fittest and the strong ruling over the weak is the natural order to things. And just like other cursed spirits, he has a disdain for humanity and being the manifestation of humanitys fear of the animal kingdom, wishes to wipe humans from the face of the earth and have only animals rule over the planet just as they did hundreds of millions of years ago. Fitting with this goal of his, animal life seems to be the only lifeform he doesn't disdain, if not outright care for, frequently using his powers to transform into various animals and hang out among them from time to time.

Abilities: Beastialar is a special grade cursed spirit who boasts incredible power, powerful CT's, massive levels of CE, and the uncanny intelligence of an apex predator. His power is so much so, that it's an unspoken rule amongst sorcerers that if you see a cursed spirit who looks half-man half-beast, don't engage, retreat, and call for backup immediately. He far outclasses even the most talented and powerful sorcerers and cursed spirits just off of physicals alone. Although he has struggled with beings on his level, he's still able to put up a good fight, even nearly killing said opponents on numerous occasions, his only shortcoming being his primal nature that sometimes hinders rational thinking and reduces his mental abilities to that of a feral animal. Another testament to his might is that he's been around God-knows how long and has yet to be exorcised.

Immense Strength: Beastialar wields physical strength far beyond what's been seen and achievable for a special grade cursed spirit, having effortlessly lifted and used massive vehicles such as buses and trains in combat in the past. He's been shown to tear through various metals as if they were paper and send his opponents flying for miles with his attacks. Even the shockwaves from his attacks causes severe damage to tall buildings and neighborhoods. His greatest feat of strength so far, was destroying the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge, the largest bridge in Japan, with a single attack.

Immense speed and agility: Beastialar boasts insanely fast speeds that aren't even perceivable to even the most experienced and powerful sorcerers. Whenever he launches an attack, it moves so fast that it's been likened to machine-gun fire. He can also maneuver and react while moving at incredible speeds, allowing him to avoid hitting things along the way and maneuver and maintain speed no matter what, regardless of limitations such as inertia. At his fastest, Beastialar can reach hypersonic speeds.

Immense durability: Beastialar is quite the tank when it comes to receiving blows. In every battle he's been apart of, he's been jumped by multiple sorcerers, all with powerful CT's in their own right and not only survive, but come out unscathed and win. His insane durability also helps when he's traveling at hypersonic speeds. 

Hand-to-hand combat: Beastialar possess immense combat skills, both offensive and defensive, that far surpass other beings of his caliber. Beastialar incorporates his immense speed, strength, reflexes, CT, and basically all aspects of practical combat when fighting. He's been shown to merge separate fighting styles together for an extra edge in combat. He's even created his own personal fighting style which he dubbed ""Beast Arts"", an animal-themed fighting style which centers around combining animal imitation with fighting. For example, fight with the brutality of a bear, move with the speed of a cheetah, dodge with the agility of a leopard, etc.

High intelligence: Despite his beastial nature, Beastialar is surprising intelligent, even by cursed spirit standards. He can easily guess his opponents overall skill level and CT after trading only a few blows or watching them in action. His predatory instincts allow him to discern all factors of any situation and is able to manipulate them so it's the most optimal and favorable for him. This also makes him a master of manipulation, pursuit, and capture. He can accurately sense what will happen and how to adapt to it, what move a target will make, where they are headed, etc. effectively allowing him to manipulate the target and causing them to inevitably play right into his hands, as well as how to attack without giving away his presence, and how to preserve energy when attacking.

Immense CE: Beastialar wields vast amounts of CE that he can finely manipulate and use at his disposal. While he rarely uses his CT and prefers a battle of fisticuffs instead, he has been shown to be able to utilize his CT repeatedly without even making a dent in his reserves. 

Cursed Technique:

Animal Manipulation: Beastialar can control and command all forms of animal life, from the smallest insects to the mightiest predators. This technique also allows him to speak with and understand animals. He mainly utilizes his CT for spying or information gathering, as just normal animals wouldn't be helpful to Beastialar in combat. 

Extension Techniques:

Cursed Critters: Similar to Kurourushi, Beastialar can produce and control his own army of various animals reinforced  by and made by his CE. This also allows him to even create any kind of animal he can think of, both living, extinct, and he has even shown the ability to create fantasy animals, although this takes up a considerably larger amount of his CE reserves then most of his abilities.

Beastial Transformation: Beastialar can transform into any animal, living, extinct, or fantasy. He can transform partially or completely, as well as use the abilities, traits and appearance of animals. The animals Beastialar has transformed into/used the abilities of include, but not limited to:

Chameleon: Camouflage, prehensile tongue

Bat: Flight, night vision, echolocation

Giant snake: Enhanced speed/agility, venomous fangs, flexible jaw/powerful bite, molting

Spider: Multiple arms/eyes, bio-electricity production, wall crawling, webbing generation/manipulation, hallucinogenic saliva

Dragon: Fire breathing, flight, immense size/strength

Shark-wolf hybrid: Underwater breathing, electrolocation, powerful bite, enhanced sense of smell, strength, and speed, fur armor generation

Domain Expansion:

Wildheart Convergence: Beastialar's DE takes the form of a jungle, a primal wilderness teeming with untamed life. Trees stand at towering heights, rivers form with raging torrents, and jagged rock formations upheave the very ground itself.

When using his DE, Beastialar can summon forth an army of shikigami that resemble animals, living, extinct, and fictional to do his bidding. These shikigami can be summoned instantly and once summoned, they immediately target anyone with CE and once they give chase they never let up until either Beastialar commands them to do so or when their target is dead. Beastialar is also bonded to the shikigami he summons inside his DE, allowing both parties to share senses and instincts with each other.

While inside the DE, Beastialar can also command the very forces of the jungle itself, unleashing lightning strikes at his opponents, cause earthquakes, and conjure storms, shaping the territory as he pleases.",1b01fv0,15,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/1b01fv0/beastialar_cursed_spirit/,"[""I really like this Cursed Spirit, his personality reminds me of Bane from Batman. The Domain's name is very cool, although I don't like the fact he can control the weather and environment in it, it seems a little bit overkill.""]"

The Use Of Conventional Weaponry In Skibidi Toilet. (This Post Is Very Long.),"Salutations, Now, As of recent times I decided to actually watch Dafuqboom's Skibidi Toilet Series after all the hate and memes I've seen, Wanting to truly see what the series truly was.

Now, I've been a fan of Mr.Boom way before the Skibidi Toilet Days, Around the times of Male\_07, Back when he was barely topping 1 Million Subscribers.

Now, The Early Episodes... They were.. Decent, But... As the series went on I got invested into it, By Episode 44 I was HOOKED, Into this series.

And I recently just watched Episode 70. That episode was great.

Now, You see. Why Am I making this post?

Well, For a good reason, to cover the use of the conventional weaponry in Skibidi Toilet.

Now, Just to keep clear what I will be covering, From Google: Conventional Weapons encompass a wide range of equipment not limited to **armoured combat vehicles, combat helicopters, combat aircraft, warships, small arms and light weapons, landmines, cluster munitions, ammunition and artillery**.

This means weapons like Acid, Lasers, Claws, Speakers, And Other Such. Will not be covered for I do not consider them conventional weaponry.

Now, Let Us Begin.

The first ever sight and use of conventional weaponry actually happened all the way back in Episode 5, With the Human Military (The United States) Taking up arms against the Toilet's, This includes Helicopters, M1 Abrams Heavy Combat Tanks, And M142 HIMARS Missle Trucks. (Correct me on the missile truck's if I'm wrong.)

But, As you can see, The Humans were all infected, So it seems... By that, Conventional Weaponry was NOT Seen as viable against the toilets.

Except, They still are, As of many examples in the series.

Now, For the next few episodes, It's mostly just, Punching, Throwing, And well.. Flushing.

I won't be covering the Camera Strider cause that has a type of Ion Cannon.

Now, In Episode 14 There comes well... AN Unorthodox Conventional Weapons, The Kamikaze. Or as it's known, The Rocket Skibidi.

The Rocket Skibidi is just Kamikaze, I can't really consider him a conventional weapon, So I'll just consider him a weapon.

But, I will consider Titan Cameraman's Shield A Conventional Weapon.

Now, In Episode 15, Comes yet ANOTHER Conventional weapon.

Bombs. (It's yours, My Friend. As long as you have enough Rupee's.)

Now, It doesn't need an explanation that Bombs are effective.

Moving On.

Now, I won't be covering the Orbital Laser used in Episode 17, That's not really conventional, More of a super weapon.

Nothing much special for the next few episodes, And no, I will not be including Titan Cameraman's Plasma Orb Cannon On His Finger.

Nothing to note in Episode 24, Other than the introduction of Speakermen, Their marching. And the fact there's possibly a female toilet. (The Toilet that gets the flusher handle shoved into their head could possibly be a female toilet.)

Now, I will be covering the Speakermen's Weapons, And Titan Speakerman's Blaster, For those... Aren't really Conventional Weapons.

Now, Nothing much for the next few episodes, I won't be considering the Parasites a conventional weapon, Cause that's more... I don't know, Biological/Chemical Warfare?

And I won't be covering the Parasite Disabler Device, Cause that's a bloody laser. (That includes The Tanks.)

Now, Moving on.

Now, Episode 37 Actually includes the first use of one of the most widely used conventional weapons in the series.

**The Knife.**

In Episode 37, The Large Speakerman On The Right Lodged A Knife onto the device/breaker on the back of First Skibidi Mutant, Disabling his movement, Thus allowing the Large Speakerman on the left to punch him.

Now, Episode 39 Comes A Long.

The TV Men's psychological beams will not be covered, As well... They're a form of psychological warfare.

Now, In Episode 44, The Episode where I got hooked into this series, Is where yet another conventional weapon.

**Rockets.**

""If You Know What's Good For You, You Will Run!"" - Soldier, Team Fortress 2.

In This Episode, The Quanlauncher Skibidi Toilet And two Masked Launcher Skibidi Toilet's are equipped with large Rocket Launchers.

Now, As we all know, TV Man became Cinemaman and well... *THX.*

Now, For Episode 47, Titan TV Man's Hooks And Claws... Now, As I said earlier in the post, I said I *Wouldn't* Consider weapons like that to be conventional, But then again...

Weapons like the Indian Bagh Nakh and the Chinese Flying Claw Weapons Exist, So...

Maybe I should reconsider, I'll leave it up to you.

But, Now comes Episode 49...

The episode where everyone's favourite Television was introduced, TV Woman.

Now, This episode actually includes the use of MULTIPLE Conventional weapons.

First off, On The Flying Buzzsaw Skibidi. (I'll leave it up to you if you want to consider Buzzsaw's a Conventional Weapon.)

On His Sides, Lay.. Two Machine Guns, No gimmicks, Nothing. Just two genuine machine guns.

Then, When the two TV Men came in, And TV Woman, Two more Weapons are shown.

They're a bit odd though.

The TV Man on the right has some type of device that shoots out a projectile, Now, It could be a type of laser, but by the sound of it it seems more likely to be a type of gun.

And then, There's TV Woman's Orange Light.

Now, I'll keep it short and simple, I'll consider the Orange Light to be a flamethrower on a different platform.

Now, Episode 50, A Turning Point In The Series, Also what I like to call, The Alliance's Counter Offensive.

Is where some Conventional Weapons are seen.

First, We have the Flamethrower Skibidi's Well... Flames.

He's just a living flame thrower, So like the Rocket Skibidi, He IS the weapon.

Now, There's also Helicopter Rocket Launcher Skibidi's Seen In The Episode. Firing At The Turret On The Alliance Base.

Then Comes In Upgraded Titan Cameraman, Now, His Gravity Gun And Laser Cannon aren't really conventional weapons, But... There is one he is holding that is a Conventional Weapon.

A WAR HAMMER.

Nothing like a good War Hammer to BONK Your opponents.

I will also consider Titan Cameraman's Core Fire A Flamethrower, Cause well, That's what it is.

Now, In Episode 51, There is the Flying Skibidi with the Four Rockets, And of course the Helicopter Toilets at the end.

Now, In Episode 52, Continuing The Alliance's Counter Offencive Ark, In comes Elite Camera Woman.

Now, Plungerman's Plungers... I'll discuss that later, But... I will consider Camera Woman's Weapon, A Conventional One, One it's a... Dart Rifle, Just a very high velocity one.

Now, Episode 53 Is Special.

In This episode, Another One Of Titan Cameraman's Weapons Are Shown.

The Guns Are His Back are a type of Grenade Launcher Or Even Howitzer.

As seen in the in the episode, Titan Cameraman's Howitzers are seen to be, Very Effective, Causing Havoc A Long The Way for the toilets.

As Napoleon Bonaparte Said: ""God Fight On The Side With The Best Artillery.""

Episode 54 is where more conventional weaponry is shown, Now, I won't consider the Paralyzer Laser Rifle a conventional weapon, Cause that's just... Laser Taser.

But, I will consider two things in the episode conventional weapons.

One#: The Large Cameraman's Batons, I mean.. Police And Nightguards use Night Sticks and Batons, So, It is.

And, Strider Skibidi's Machine Gun. I mean, it's a machine gun.

Now, Nothing of much to say in Episode 55.

I mean, There's the helicopter Skibid's and The Flying Skibidi Triplet Tub, But that's about it.

And before you ask, No, I will not consider Astro Toilet's Weapon to be a conventional one.

Now, Episode 56, This episode shows a TV Man fighting In Close Combat for the first time, It show him stabbing the toilets with a knife.

Now, This knife is actually similar to the Hidden Blade from the Assassins Creed Franchise. (I can actually see a TV Man as an assassin now, Maybe that's what the Elite TV Man will be.)

And in Episode 57, One of the Strider Toilers is equipped with four large blades to stab Titans, Now... It's just giant blades, So they are conventional weapons.

And it also sadly the episode where Titan Cameraman loses his WAR HAMMER, And it also shown how TV Woman's hands can turn into sharp blades, Or that she just hidden blades like an Assassin from Assassins Creed.

Nothing much for Episode 58 Other than the Rocket Toilets, And nothing really for Episode 59 Other than the fact of, Well, The Multi Weapon Toilet. (Who Has Rockets.) And well the Flying Toilet who shot Titan Speakerman.

This is also the episode where I heard Depeche Mode for the first time.

Now, For Episode 61, There's the Buzzsaw Car Skibidi, And then Charlie/Moistcrit1kal Skibidi, He uses high powered flashlight's, something like a flood light, Imalent SR32 Flashlight to blind the Cameramen and shoot them with Rockets.

Then, Speaker Woman comes in, And ends the Charlie Toilet, Now, Not much to say other than the fact she shot knives into his eyes.

This is also the first and only episode where we see a Large Speakerman doing the dance, Or as we all know it, The Orange Justice.

Now, Episode 62 Comes, This is the episode that I call, ""The Toilet's Counter Offensive.""

Now, There is actually a conventional weapon shown here, Bombs. Again.

This time, From The Air.

The Bomber Plane Skibidi Toilet can be seen in the episode dropping bombs, Now, It's like a traditional bomber plane, Something Like the B-17 Flying Fortress, Or the German Heinkel He 177 Greif.

Episode 63 Also now shows the use of yet another Conventional Weapon, It is shown in the first few seconds of the episode.

It is shown has the alliance is now equipping Grenade Launchers on their... Jeeps? APC's? Whatever one you prefer to call it.

And it is shown to be... Effective, As you can see.

Then Some Helicopter Skibidi's Come in and destroy the first jeep, Then we are shown Elite Speakerman with his two knives, Then another APC get's destroyed by the Mutant Skibidi.

Then comes in Upgraded Plungerman with the Glitch Toilet Mobile.

And then the mutant is finished off by the Injured Large Speakerman by getting stunned by his audio wave,

Then we see the Bomber Skibidi Again, Only to be destroyed by Titan Cameraman's New Rail Cannon.

This is also the SECOND Episode where I heard Depeche Mode Again.

Now, Not much for Episode 64, Other than... An Anomaly.

The Rocket Skibidi in this episode, That was infront of G-Man, Had Acid Filled Missiles.

Now, Missiles are a conventional weapon, But as I said I wouldn't considering Acid a conventional weapon, But... This one's an anomaly, So... I'll leave it up. And also when it was flushed, It had a bomb in it, So.... I will also consider the toilet itself a weapon.

Then comes Episode 65, Where we are met with... The Police Skibidi, Now... His weapons are... Odd...

It's a Nail Gun, Or more over.. A Spike Gun.

The Police Skibidi's Gun are similar to the Rail Way Rifle from the Fallout Series, A Makeshift Steam Punk styled gun that fires Rail Way Spikes. That's essentially what it is.

I'll leave it up to you to decide if it's conventional or not.

Then during the Fake G-Toilet Battle, Titan Speakerman can be seen using the Trick He used on Titan Cinemaman by using a knife to stab his head, Only this time using two Knives to take out Fake G-Toilet's Eyes.

And then there's.. Kamikaze's, Again.

Now, Episode 66, It's special...

In the start, We see the battle is not like the battles from Previous Episodes, Instead, It's being fought like a conventional war. Not like battles from previous episodes where it was more Medieval and just charging at eachother.

Both sides have Strider Skibidi's With Machine Guns And Rocket Launcher, And Helicopter Skibidi's Firing at Large Cameramen (And One Normal one) who have been equipped with a new weapon.

They now have... Bazooka's.

There's also the Speakerman on the Upgraded Toilet Car, Now including weapons. It could possibly be guns or even rockets, But. We never saw them used, So. It's up to guessing and deciding.

And it is shown in the episode the Alliance has their own helicopter now, The Camera Copter can be seen firing two Volley's Rockets at the Toilet's before being shot down.

Then we see the POV Cameraman paralyzing a normal Skibidi with his Paralyzer Rifle, Then another following up with his Dart Rifle.

Now, I would consider the Dart Rifle NOT A Conventional Weapon, But... There is argument.

It's not actually a Dart Rifle, But rather... A Flechette Gun.

You see, The Alliance's Dart Rifle is actually similar to a real world weapon we have.

The Steyr ARC. A Flechette Firing Bull Pup Rifle made of Polymer From The 90s Made In Austria. Deutsche Qualität.

From Wikipedia: The **Steyr ACR** was a prototype [flechette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flechette)\-firing [assault rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle) built for the [US Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Army)'s [Advanced Combat Rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Combat_Rifle) program of 1989/90. Although the [Steyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steyr_Mannlicher) design proved effective, as did most of the weapons submitted, the entire ACR program ended with none of the entrants achieving performance 100% better than the [M16A2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16A2), the baseline for a successful ACR weapon.

So, Essentially, That's what the Alliance's Dart Rifle Is, A Steyr ACR Rifle.

And that's also what Camera Woman's Gun Is, An ACR.

I'll leave it up it to you.

I should also mention the tactic used by the Two Cameramen in the beginning of the Episode is similar to a German Sniping Tactic from the Second World War.

When the Paralyzer Cameraman Shot His Laser, The Cameraman With The Flechette Rifle followed up with two shots.

This is similar to a tactic used in the Second World War, By German Snipers.

The One With The Sniper Rifle, would fire fire, Hopefully It's target, Then, The second squad mate would follow up shots with his gun, Either it be a Gewehr 43 or MP-40, And STG-44. (I don't know if this was actually a German Squad Tactic, I just saw it in a Short Film.)

Now, of course, The Alliance get's the message of their two injured titans, Rage Mode Activate.

And now it got Medieval Again, This time with all the raged induced Camera And Speaker Men charging at the toilets, And as we can see with the First Toilet who was punched by POV Cameraman, Was given a knife by the Secret Agent to stab the toilet.

Then, As we can see down the road, The Injured Rocket Skibidi was then stabbed to death by Speaker Woman and Elite Speakerman.

The Helicopter Toilet was then shot down by Elite Camera Woman's ACR.

And... We can see the Strider Skibidi firing it's Machine Gun at the Speaker Man, Which the Strider Skibidi was then killed by a Helicopter Skibidi being controlled by TV woman, Who used Rockets to kill it.

Then, We see the Upgraded Strider Skibidi appear, Now, he uses two lasers, But, Just as any Strider Skibidi, He has a machine gun. Though, Possibly a more powerful and upgraded one.

Now, That's it for Episode 66.

Let us move on.

In Episode 67, We are met by the POV Of a Large Cameraman, He is with a Fellow Large Cameraman, The Both of Them carrying Two Bazooka's And they begin transported to the base why a cameraman driving the APC.

Then, Two Skibidi's Attack The APC.

Now, These two are special, For One Reason.

These Toilet's Were Equipped with Light Machine Guns On Them.

Yes, Just... Normal Light Machine Guns, No Weird Gimmick Or Anything, Just normal bullets.

They were then killed by the POV Large Cameraman with his Bazooka's.

Later Down The Road, The Police Skibidi with his Spike Guns came in, Killing the Driver Cameraman And Injuring the Second Large Cameraman.

The Police Skibidi Flew Away after the POV Large Cameraman who had much better aim than the other Large Cameraman, Hit his weapons.

After that, They get out of the APC, And the Injured Large Cameraman Takes Care of the now Injured Police Skibidi with one last rocket, Taking him out.

Then the Upgraded Mafia Toilet Comes in, Kills the Injured Large Cameraman, Then it cuts to the Injured Titans.

Titan Cameraman used his Back Howitzers One Last Time on the Buzzsaw Skibidi before it got melted by the Mafia Toilet, Who then got slapped, Had acid splashed over him, Then slapped again.

Then, In comes the Scientist Toilet Mech.

Now, He has, Well... The Laser Cannons, His Eye Laser, And then The Acid Rocket Launchers Again, Then the Speakers and the TV.

But... He does have ONE Conventional Weapon.

On the side of his head, Is a Cannon.

This is the only conventional weapon the Scientist Toilet Mech Possesses.

Fortunately, He only got to fire it twice, As Titan Speakerman stabbed it with his knife.

Now, Moving onto everything, G-Man coming in, The Reveal Of The Scientist's TV, Then Upgraded Titan TV Man coming in.

Now, I can't say much about Titan TV Man, the only conventional weapon he has, is... His blade.

I can't really say much in Skibidi Toilet 68, Other than the fact that one of the Flying G-Toilet clones has Box Rocket launcher like the United States Army M202 FLASH.

And the fact that there's two Rocket Helicopter Skibidi's.

The Rockets I'd argue to be better against Titan TV Man cause the lasers just powered him up.

Then there's also the Worker Skibidi's in Part 2, Who uses a Spike Gun similar to the Police Skibidi.

And, That's all I can say other than the Very Large Cameraman with the Bazooka.

And Elite Speakerman's Knives.

Now, Let's move onto Episode 69, Part One.

Now we can talk about Plungerman's, Plunger.

Now, Plungers AREN'T Conventional weapons, They aren't even a weapon.

But, In this episode, Oddly...

Plungerman's Plunge now has... Spikes on it, This turned it into a mace type weapon.

Now, I will consider Plungerman's Now Makeshift Plunger Mace, a conventional weapon. Cause it's like the Trench Clubs from the First World War.

Then, We see the Two Speakermen with the group.

They have conventional close quarters weapons as well.

One of them has barbed wire bat.

""What's the matter? You freakin stupid?"" - Scout, Team Fortress 2.

And the other, A Knife.

""Well, Off to visit your mother!"" - Spy, Team Fortress 2.

Of course, The Only Action we saw from these weapons was from the Bat Speakerman whacking already paralyzed Skibidi's.

Now, Nothing more for the rest of Part One.

But, Two is where things get interesting.

At the end of Episode 69 Part Two, It is shown that... The Alliance is now equipping the regular soldiers with more conventional weapons.

As seen in the episode, They have shotguns now.

And at the end of the episode, We see the POV Cameraman pulling out some weird weapon.

And in the beginning of Episode 70 Part One. We see that the rolls of Toilet Papers from the previous episode were actually Grenades.

And also at the beginning, We can see one of the Camerman using their shotguns.

Then those... Rocket Skibidi's On Wheels came in, Destroyed him, The The Large Juggernaut Cameraman came in and destroyed their whole battalion with his Laser Cannon.

Then at the end of Episode 70 Part One, Upgraded Elite Camerawoman Is Shown, And now she has Two Flechette Rifles On Her Arms.

Now, Not much more for Part Two, Other than the fact Pipe Bombs were introduced into the series.

Then at the end of Episode 70 Part Two, Elite Speakerman grabs a spear and... A Machete of sorts.

Now, Let's move on to Episode 70 Part Three.

In Episode 70 Part Three, During the battle with The Scientist, Elite Speakerman threw his new weapons into the head of The Scientist, Which seem to have little effect, Then Plungerman threw his Plunger Mace into the Scientist Toilet's Left Eye, Which did some damage.

Plungerman then blocked the laser from Scientist Toilet with his Flechette Rifle, Which softened the blast enough for him to live.

Then, We skip to the Scientist Jumping Into His Second Mech.

Now, At First, It looks like his Second Mech only has Lasers, But... Upon Closer Inspection, He actually has Two Cannons In-Between The Lasers, The Same One's Used On His Larger Mech.

Now, When we cut to The Juggernaut Cameraman and the Female Trio coming in, The Juggernaut Cameraman Actually shot off one of the Scientist's Cannons, But.. You see, The One On His Right was left Undamaged. Meaning it could be captured and researched.

Now, Let's cut to the Scientist throwing the Female Trio Off Him, When they're next to Injured Plungerman, Elite Camera Woman is shown having a much larger gun on her back. It seems that one is actually a laser.

But... That's all for now.

I have covered the use of Conventional Weaponry.

Now, What can we summarize from this?

Conventinal Weaponry was first, abandoned, then tested, Then adopted again.

And we can see in the series how it went from a medieval styled charging at each other warfare to a more conventional one.

And with the series now going into a new stage, I believe the war will evolve into a conventional one.

Possibly seeing use of more guns and other conventional weaponry.

Also, I would like to thank Mr.Boom for introducing me to Depeche Mode, It's a grand band, Glad he introduced me to it.

And to anyone else who has listened to Depeche Mode cause of Mr.Boom, Tell me.

"""New kid on the block"" achievement bugged?","Dear Spartans,   


I have a question because I'm at the end of my nerves/whims/call-it-the-fuck-you-want.   


Is this fuckin' achievement bugged? Pardon my language but a lot of times I've managed to GET enemies with Commando, ofc, WITHOUT MISSING A SHOT and ending on a Headshot? I've even had a situation where I found an afk player in BTB, doing it on them and nothing. I literally went shot per shot, NOT TO CHANCE a miss with a fuckin' awful bloom from this weapon and I killed him in like, 4-5 shots.   


I saw somewhere that with a Commando, it needs to be 7 shots with an 8th going to the head. HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU DO THAT IN A REGULAR PVP FIGHT, when as soon as the bloom kicks in, the gun goes haywire and no amount of sensitivity (high or low) can control that properly, without, ofc, missing a shot. NOT TO MENTION with people strafing (as they should), in order to, well, NOT GET KILLED.  


How? I mean, do I NEED TO COUNT the shots(?), because, if I do not miss, break the shields and finish them with a shot to the head, why wouldn't it count? Even if it's below the 7 count shot or whatever the fuck the count is. (Note that I know that I need to be the one doing 100% of the damage to the target)  


This must be the hardest and the most fucked up achievement I've ever came across and it's stopping me from achieving platinum. Can I get any clarification on this? Any help? Advice? ANYTHING.   


343 (from what I saw) did not mention WHEN the bots will be coming back and who knows if they'll even allow for PVP achievements to be completed, once they come back.   


In advance, I would KINDLY ask ""git gud"" people to refrain themselves, because we all know that you got the achievement on the bots or you did it on an AFK player. Maybe 2%(or even below that) of the player base got it in a REGULAR pvp fight.

Ralthum 84th - Counterattack,"With the greentide charging ahead with no signs of stopping, a counter assault had been prepared whilst forces at Saint Patroclus' Keep were ordered to dig in and prepare defensives.

Several tank companies of the 84th were prepared to smash into the ork lines. The only reprieve being that the war bands had, for the most part, broke down and scattered amongst themselves, some infighting had been spotted by scouts.

Of the Tau lines, little was known, much had folded back but it seemed the ork advance had stalled.

=================================

*Tau’s Bane* led the charge, with *Reaper* and the remnants of Flynts company close behind. 

**TC Tanckova**: This is it Gentlemen, time for a real fight.

The tanks screamed across the landscape, in the distance, ork guns slammed without any semblance of order.

A voice crackled across the vox

“This—*cough* is Commissar Rast…last wave of transports from Shortama got hit by flak. We’re down hard.”

**TC Tanckova**: Hold on Commissar, we Read you. I’ll divert some of my forces to unfrak your situation.

**Commissar Rast**: Copy all. Im consolidating our forces, Frak load of civilians here too. Ordered other transports to wave off, areas too hot. Be advised, orks want us bad. We’ve got the high ground but they’ve got the numbers.”

**TC Tanckova**: Copy. Be with you presently.

She switched to the vox of her tank columns.

**TC Tanckova**: Column Aion, Nyx, Fides and Huginn with me, everyone else continue on mission!

"Out of Cruel Space, Part 933","[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/)  

The Bounty Hunters  
  
  
Pukey and Sallie arrive in the infirmary after just a little bit and Susie-Lu is sitting under a scanner that is slowly moving a green beam across her body to check for any problems.  
  
Cindy’s reaction is to Pukey arriving is to rush over and give him a hug. He kneels down to catch her and lifts her up.  
  
“How’s everything holding up in the... two hours I’ve been gone?” Pukey asks checking the time and Cindy laughs.  
  
“Well, the eggs are incubating beautifully. They’ve begun to twitch just ever so slightly.” Cindy says almost vibrating in his arms.  
  
“Whut? The eggs of... what your kind twitch before hatchin’?” Sallie asks.  
  
“That’s right. Here! You sit too! Having a baseline for your sister’s health will be a great help.” Cindy says hopping out of Pukey’s arms and then pulling Sallie along and getting her to sit.  
  
“And what about our little guest? How’s the tiny wriggler doing?” Pukey asks even as Cindy activates the scanner and then turns.  
  
“She’s finally fallen asleep. The severe sunburn is already fading and will be passed in a few more hours. I also used a very low intensity scan and it seems that her body’s particular Axiom defences react very, very poorly to Ultraviolet light. I can’t tell you the specifics yet. My specialties are prosthetics and surgery after all. But I have the local network to help and while much of Mordonan is primitive for one reason or another, it’s still got the communication pylons for The Lablan Empire in orbit and they’ve got all the info I need. I just need time for my search algorithms to sift through the useless stuff to find the good.”  
  
“So it’s the Axiom in her that makes her vulnerable to sunlight.” Pukey says as he starts walking over to where the tiny figure is sleeping. The area is in shadow to allow the little one to rest in comfort and he looks down. Where the burns are the light does not shine through. He can make out the tiny places where Onyx’s fur had sheltered the child from the sunlight.  
  
Like many, many races the galaxy over, this little mollusc person has hair for some reason. It’s short and downy and collects the light pouring from the child’s head to give her a pale green halo around her head as she sleeps. Unlike the rest of her, it seems to be bone dry. Pukey wonders at that.  
  
“She’s cute when she’s not screaming, isn’t she?” Cindy asks.  
  
“You’re going to have to look long and hard to find any baby that isn’t absolutely adorable while napping.” Pukey agrees as he gently reaches down with his prosthetic arm and softly brushes a lock of hair out of the baby’s face. She squirms ever so and deflates a bit before reinflating and resting further. “Did the scan tell you anything else?”  
  
“Dietary preferences, the species is omnivorous but has a digestive preference towards plants. Likely a lot of roots, moss and fungus. However I was able to feed her some leafy greens and not only is it sitting very well, but it has a few nutrients she was missing.” Cindy says walking up and pressing a button to cause holographic steps to fade in. She walks up them until she’s at shoulder height with Pukey.  
  
“The species seems to use milk like most, however this little one is a few months old at least and is ready to start going for more solid foods. Or at least something pre-chewed. She only has two and a half teeth.”  
  
“A half?” Pukey asks and Cindy reaches down to point at a little nub in the open mouth of the baby.  
  
“Half out.” She says. She then turns her gaze to the incubators in the corner of the room and smiles. The spherical egg she had laid and the longer one that Lytha had birthed were side by side in their own pods. The whole readout was green across the board. All good.  
  
Pukey puts his arm around her. “I’m glad you’ve got some place to put all that mom energy you’ve been struggling to burn off. With The Chainbreaker being so safe and secure it’s been hard on you to find something to do with all that den making drive.”  
  
“The circumstances could be better, but next time around Slithern won’t have me fussing him so much.”  
  
“That’s good, and also bad. Half the reason he’s been in the gun range as much as he has been recently is because you don’t like it in there and he wanted some alone time.”  
  
“I’m not that bad!”  
  
“I never said it was bad.”  
  
“Ya’ll think they forgot about us?” Sallie asks Susie-Lu.  
  
“We haven’t forgotten either of you.” Cindy calls back and Pukey’s head snaps around with his eyes wide.  
  
“Who are you!?”  
  
“Really?” Sallie asks.  
  
“No.” He says with a grin. One of the machines gives a ding and Cindy hops off the stairs and rushes towards the central control of the scanning device.  
  
“Alright then! Thank you both for your patience, and the verdict is that while Susie-Lu isn’t hurt or sick she hasn’t been eating enough and could use some more water. So this doctor is recommending a meaty stew and a tall glass of water to re-hydrate and get her protein levels back up.” Cindy says before pausing and patting her stomach. “Also for myself, I missed a meal taking care of our adorable little slug.”   
  
“I see so...” Pukey says before Cindy reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out a small remote and presses the button. “What is that?”  
  
She holds up three fingers, lowers one, then another and then points to the door right as it opens and an automatic stroller floats in. “When did you get that?”  
  
“You’ll NEVER know!” She teases him.  
  
“I have ways of making you talk.”  
  
“Yes and those ways involve us needing another one of those.” Cindy counters pointing back to the stroller. Being literally threatened with a good time was not something she had ever prepared for as a little girl, but she was an adaptable woman.  
  
“But it is effective.”  
  
“I never said it wasn’t.”  
  
“Dust’s sake you two! Kiss or knock it off!” Sallie states and Pukey shrugs before sweeping Cindy into a bridal carry and kissing her deeply.  
  
“You’re not allowed to be mad when they do what you tell them.” Susie-Lu chides her sister after a moment as it becomes very clear that the kiss is not going to be quick or chaste.  
  
“The worst part is that they ain’t forgetten’ us, they just ain’t got no shame.” Sallie grumps.  
  
“What do they have to be ashamed of?” Susie-Lu asks. “Aside from leaving a starving girl to go hungry while they tongue wrestle.”  
  
“Oh fine. Be joyless.” Cindy chides after they break off the kiss. She then bundles around and gently transfers the sleeping infant to the stroller and activates the hood to keep the light off the little napper. “Now then, who wants to eat?”

“So uh... wuts this and why’s it cold?” Sallie asks as the big frozen dish of something is handed to her.  
  
“It’s cold because we froze it to store it. We’ll reheat it when we have a bit for everyone. What it is is a Chunky Lanwrack Stew.”  
  
“The spit’s a lanwrack?”   
  
“Big doofy lizard that has all the meat in it’s tails. It eats and eats and eats, putting more and more fat and muscle on the tails and can grow them back too. Meaning it’s a perfect food animal. Just chop off one of it’s three tails and it doesn’t even slow down as it grows that one back.”   
  
“The heck does doofy mean?”  
  
“It’s a really stupid animal. I mean really stupid.” Pukey says.  
  
“How stupid is stupid?”  
  
“If you were to give it a big bucket of all it’s favourite foods it will not eat them, because if the food is not on the branch then it doesn’t see it as food.” Pukey says.  
  
“Wow... that is stupid.” Sallie admits.  
  
“But it’s completely harmless so instead of being annoying it’s more endearing. Hence doofy. But it tastes pretty good and is very healthy. So lets get all these heated up and get eating.”  
  
“Ya’ll are hungry too?”  
  
“I’m human, we eat a lot more than most races our size. In fact we generally eat a little more than most Cannidors who start off eight times our size and get BIGGER.” Pukey remarks. “Of course the fact that most humans off our home world are highly trained soldiers that need a lot more food than average also helps with that. But that’s just nitpicking details at this point”   
  
“I see, so what do we do with these frozen clumps?” Susie-Lu asks.  
  
“Here, this is a basic thermal food projector. Different from what was used back home, and far better to be honest.” Pukey says as he guides both woman to a small part of the wall and places his and Cindy’s meal inside. He then taps it on the ‘toasty’ setting and a pale red beam projects from the top and into the frozen stew for about five seconds as it rapidly melts. The beam turns off and he pulls out the tray. “The numbers and symbols on the side are temperature notations and the word is just what we generally call it. Warm, Toasty or Hot are you best options.”  
  
“What happens if we put our hands in there?” Susie-Lu asks.  
  
“It will not turn on until the hand is removed.” Pukey says.  
  
“And if we stick it in while it’s going?”  
  
“It turns off. These things are pretty idiot proof, you need to be extra special stupid to hurt yourself with it.” Pukey says as he sits down at the nearby table where Cindy is waiting.  
  
“And how’d they do that?” Sallie asks as she watches her food heat up to a nice hot temperature and moves out of the way as Susie-Lu decides to have some nice warm soup instead.  
  
“By breaking the machine and turning off the safety features.” Pukey answers before looking to the right as the door to the Mess Hall opens and Cindy starts waving Lytha over.  
  
“Wut the...?” Sallie asks as she sees the massive Synthetic Nagasha slither in. “Uh... I didn’t... have ya’ll had yer... everythin’ replaced?!”   
  
“Oh, no I haven’t. I was made this way.” Lytha answers as she settles in next to the table and leans down to kiss Pukey. “I am Lytha Powercoil. Your eye in the sky and the voice in your ear when your working with The Chainbreakers. Also I’m the chaplain of the ship. So if your spirit needs tending, I can certainly sooth your pain.”  
  
Sallie pauses, clearly looks from side to side and considers. Thinks then turns to Lytha.

“And I am a Sister of the Synthetic Ascendancy, or the Synth Ascendancy. We believe that evolution and learning are just two parts of becoming something greater, technology is part of it as well.

“You were Built!?” Susie-Lu asks in fascination as she clearly starts taking Lytha apart with her eyes.  
  
“I was. While we still struggle to make a full, actual person from scratch on a computer, we CAN copy someone. I was copied from Lisa Powercoil before she could be fully be made into a synth herself?”  
  
“Wait... you can make someone into a... synth is it? As in no more meat? Just metal and... what else are you made of?”  
  
“Plastics, ceramics, carbon fibre nanotubes, a great deal of khutha totems and many, many other bits. The full list is rather extensive.” Lytha says. “And yes, it’s very possible for someone to become a fully Synthetic  person, but the final few touches take time, and rushing it can kill them.”   
  
“What part is that?” Susie-Lu asks in fascination.  
  
“Up here.” Lytha says tapping her head. “The mind and consciousness may live in the brain, but it’s not stuck there. You can shift it to a machine, but it moves at it’s own pace, and rushing it can only hurt it.”   
  
“That’s incredible.” Susie-Lu gushes before beginning to grill Lytha about everything about Synths. Sallie has to remind her to eat more than once.

Macin Smith Still Missing ,"Them being Mormon MIGHT have had a problem IF Macin Smith was a homosexual. BUT, I have yet to see evidence of this claim. However, killing him is very extreme and unnecessary! 
FIRST AND FOREMOST, He likely would have been ""councilled"" by the Mormon Church, Corrective Action Youth Groups or the Church Elder Leadership against his ""SINFUL, SLOTHENLY, PERVERTED, UNNATURAL FALL FROM BOTH HIS FAMILIES AND GOD'S GRACE ways"".
He would have been given NUMEROUS fantastical STEARN LECTURES ON THE SINS OF EVERYTHING HE ENJOYED! Just like most repressed teenagers who are searching for some enjoyment in his life 
THEN, if he rebelled against the Mormon Church and/or his OWN family in the slightest way (video games, reading Anime and that LUDICROUS video game/Anime reading material CURFEW).

That resulted in his gaming console, video games, Anime magazines and INTERNET ROUTER being COMMANDEERED by his biological father that fateful night. At the time of this he was a polite, nice, shy and quiet 17 year old HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT. 
It really irks me that DESPITE HIS OBVIOUSLY DEPRESSIVE STATE, loner qualities, lack of a real social circle (despite his largely scattered Mormon family) that his father chose to continuously harp on him everyday, took away all the activities that brought him interest, happiness and solace and YET CHOSE, not to do the most productive thing for Macin.
If he really cared he would have sought out a psychiatrist or a psychologist that could have helped him.

Macin Smith's case and actions are very typical in the sense of not wanting to be found. He took nothing. No personal effects, food or drinks, additional clothing, his Drivers License or School ID Card, important papers such as his SS Card, Birth Certificate, Journals, Anime drawings, additional electronics such as a cellphone to sell, nothing of monetary value to pawn, oh yeah and HIS WALLET!!! 
I have a few reservations regarding WHY/IF his computer/laptop Internet Search History was wiped clean, taken away at 9:30pm by his ""Father"", locked in the RECENTLY RECONCILLED parent's bedroom and left when Macin disappeared. 
For one, I agree with you that it's possible he wiped the Internet Search History that night in an attempt to cover up his plans to disappear without a trace. But due to his parents controlling and domineering ways, sadly I see Macin doing this on a daily/nightly basis as a way to avoid any further punishments.
Sadly, I have known many younger and older people who have committed suicide. Younger ones tend to be despondent and blame a parent(s). IMO, Macin being a 17 year old DID NOT go to the ""outskirts of the desert"" to kill himself. Especially, not having left a suicide note in a very visible place and sadly killing himself closer to home where he could be found easily.

It was Macin's mother that stated he did receive a minimal allowance IF he followed the rules. Once his father rejoined the family he no longer received an allowance. His father simply stated that Macin was not following the "" THE RULES"". Previously, it has been explained, that she believed the allowance he received from his mother had been spent on computer video games, a gaming console and the numerous in-purchase ""add ons"" for such games.
Regarding ""what of substance could be in a 17 y.o.'s wallet""?

Well, he did have a UT Driver's Permit (never mentioned by LE or family), also a Highschool Student Identification (never found) and lastly Journals he valued greatly. He kept them handwritten, as opposed to on his computer, once his father joined them in Utah.

Additionally, the Utah landscape is very punishing and it's extremely easy to lose track of where you are/were. IMO, it would be near impossible, or at the very least risky, for him to return to retrieve hidden clothing or food and water he ""hid"" almost 5 months prior. Besides, at that point MANY MANY people said he had a great relationship with his mother and was happy and excited for the future. Mostly because his father was no longer around and there had been rumors of divorce between his parents.

NOW THIS! This gives me an awful amount of hope. I, myself, was very into gaming, LARPing, following R&R bands, etc. I am one of the lucky ones (being female) that I have NOTHING but great experiences with both meeting people and traveling long distances alone, with only people who I didn't know! 
THIS IS ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT I HOPE HAS HAPPENED TO MACIN SMITH!!!  HE WAS SO YOUNG AND JUST LOOKING FOR LITERALLY HIMSELF!  I hope he connected with great gamer friends that understood him, loved him and helped him begin a new life!

I DO NOT DISAGREE WITH NOR THINK THAT THE UNDATED, ""SUICIDAL NOTE"", FOUND INSIDE OF AN EMPTY WALLET... SIX DAYS LATER, IS NOT INDICTIVE OF A SUICIDAL INTERACTION OR SUICIDAL IDEATION! 
Instead, I am of two beliefs as to why it was written, as you stated. It's possible it was written, by him to his parents, as an attempt to get them to HEAR what he had to say. All of his previous vocal attempts were completely disregarded and he was not only NOT HEARD by ANYONE at home. EVEN more tragically, his written/drawn pleas for help from school officials. These were found in numerous depressing Creative Writing and English Paper assignments, the skillful, yet, despondent and painfully sad drawings in his Art class also point to a young man with severe depression and loneliness.

Even his siblings didn't really express much interest in listening to what he was going through at home. Most of ALL his siblings had left or been kicked out of the parents home, before the move to Utah. Some were still teenagers, the rest very young adults. 

This to me suggests a very domineering household, run by the husband, and his need for TOTAL & ABSOLUTE control over HIS ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD, ALL OF IT'S MATERIAL BELONGINGS, HIS WIFE, and ALL OF HIS CHILDREN!! 

Lastly, I too, would have put the 3 page note on the refrigerator!! But I believe he was a very depressed, lonely, distraught, confused, sad, angry, very emotionally vulnerable and bullied YOUNG 17 Y.O. TEENAGER WHEN HE DISAPPEARED.

Most likely he simply had resigned himself to the fact that either:
1. The 3 page ""suicide"" note simply wouldn't make any positive difference for his situation at home.
OR...
2. The note in the wallet (found 6 days later) was simply an ""exercise"" in writing your feelings down for therapy/counseling that was never meant to be read by the parents.
OR...
3. The letter being stuffed and ""hidden"" in his bedroom drawer was to ENSURE that IF IT WAS FOUND he would not get into any further trouble.

I believe he ditched part of, if not most, of school that day or took off afterwards. He decided to go hang out with friends he met either at school or in the gaming community. Likely, he was still angry from the night and night(s) before and being a teenager wanted SOME FREEDOM!  All this poor young man wanted was to alleviate his depression and enjoy his hobbies: playing games, reading Anime, behave like a teen without repercussions and  have a general semblance of freedom!

MY PERSONAL OPINION ON MACIN SMITH

I believe he voluntarily left that fateful day fed up with being a 17 y.o. who was treated at home as a MUCH younger child. He received good grades, followed his home curfew, diligently did his chores, worked PT as an unpaid tutor at his highschool and was regarded as a good kid! 

On the flip side: Macin was obviously depressed and suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue.
***SIDE NOTE IS MAJORITY OF MORMON'S DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR ANY TYPE OF MENTAL ILLNESS***

Yet, according to his parents, his mental health troubles were minor and never so bad that the parents removed the unlocked guns and ammunition from the home or added a gun safe. WTF?!
However, none of the guns were missing from the home. No clear and distinct suicide note was found in the open. He did not take a single piece of his vital Documentation, No food, No water.... Nothing!

My belief he is still alive and out there hopefully living the life he dreamed of is this: 

His only other options are; suicide, accidental death (run over, fell, etc), murdered or a major traumatic psychological event/psychosis.

SUICIDE: Explained above, would've found body near by family home.
ACCIDENTAL DEATH: Very rough terrain could have caused this, however, he or something of his would have been found already.
MURDERED: This is possible if he was hitchhiking, got into the wrong vehicle, etc. Yet, he had literally no possessions on him so probably not robbery. Could he have been the victim of a serial killer? Again... probably not. For MANY reasons.
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA/PSYCHOSIS: This is what I think was the catalyst in him leaving. Depression and Apathy on his part would certainly be a reason to leave. Sadly, it seems he had no long-term plans to care for himself. If indeed he is living destitute or surviving on the streets he is at a huge risk of being institutionalized, remaining homeless or seeking help with his mental health and homelessness. Sadly, these Government Systems that are supposed to assist people like Macin, are subpar and extensively understaffed and underfunded.

If you know of any sightings since mid 2018 post them here or message me privately. I simply want Macin to be found. \n\nI have extensively looked into Las Vegas, NV. I\'ve gone to and spoken with managers at Casinos, reviewed 1,000\'s of hours of surveillance footage, gone to speak to volunteer\'s and hundred\'s and hundred\'s of people in various Homeless Outreach Networks, over 50 Homeless Shelters for Men, In and Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinics, Methadone Centers, Mental Health Hospitals and Addiction Clinic\'s and practically every pawn shop, cheap grocery store, gas station, work for hire boards and more.\n\nNow, let me be very clear and concise here. I DO NOT THINK MASON HAD A DRUG PROBLEM! I STILL DO NOT! BUT, THESE ARE PLACES THAT NEEDED TO BE CHECKED OUT. HE PROBABLY NEEDED A TEEN SHELTER OR SIMILAR ONCE HE LEFT HOME WITH NOTHING... The options that are centered around Mental Health are based on two ideologies.\n\nThe first, that when Macin disappeared he was suffering from severe depression and other issues. Being that his family is of the Mormon Faith he would not have been able to take ANY medication for his Mental Health and was possibly seeking treatment.\n\nSecondly, during and even after the COVID Pandemic new Substance Abuse Center\'s were constantly being opened and filled to capacity. Perhaps, some substance abuse treatment center was adamant he get proper Identification. THIS could mean that he DID obtain ID AFTER his 18th Birthday and that he is going by either an alias or some form of his actual name. \n\nOver 2,500 plus hours doing true ""leg work research"" on the ground, by speaking to anyone that will speak with me or take a flyer. Even going as far as to enter the Las Vegas Storm Drain Tunnels looking for leads. After this, I spoke yet AGAIN with not 2 or 3 BUT 6 DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT Agencies. They stated that unless he was a KNOWN & VERY VIOLENT person he wouldn\'t likely be in the tunnels at all! \n\nIf, for some reason, he had been down there and met with foul play his body would have been found, washed outside of the storm tunnels and into the storm drain fallout. He\'d have been found right in the middle of the desert, in any of the 15 designated areas.\n\nAlso, if he was violent enough to be down there, then LE assured me he would have been arrested, had a mugshot taken or had been through the Court System, possibly resulting in a Bench Warrant being set. Seeing as he was a minor with no record, no fingerprints in any database and probably going under an alias, I asked to speak to a superior. \n\nWith the permission of Lt. R. Oldenburg, I was permitted to look over various mugshot books and review any arrest records of adults and minors (names redacted) that possibly matched the time-frame. Now, obviously some of these are not for review by LE. So, I prioritized my research and left Nevada with the names, etc of people that I could look up in Public Records.\n\nI am still researching over 200 of the nearly 750 possible names/photos/rap sheets that could have been or are indeed Macin Smith. I will continue to actively pursue even the smallest lead in hopes of finding him alive.\n\nWithin a fair degree of certainty, I am pretty positive Macin never went to Nevada, let alone Las Vegas, NV. The weather at night and during winter months is absolutely freezing! With no shelter, Macin, being a smart kid, with knowledge of the desert and it\'s extreme weather fluctuations wouldn\'t have chose this destination.\n\nWhere I am based, in Los Angeles California, the opposite is true. We have extremely favorable weather (it rains maybe 10-14 days a year and the night temps reach as low as 42°), beaches, National Parks with free camping, a huge situational homeless population, County offices that provide a One-Day Approved Emergency Support Services Network. To receive benefits you do not need ID, SS number, Birth Certificate or any documentation. If he was asked by the police or a street service volunteer, if he needed a Shelter Voucher, Transportation Voucher, Medical or Psychological assistance, Food or even something to drink.... He would have been taken to the Social Services Department or a County Hospital for evaluation. \n\nI firmly believe Macin first made his way to California. If he stayed here or not, I think he did, but could be wrong. Another MAJOR reason I believe he came here, is here or was here is our Railroad System.

"1066th penal regiment. Part 24, integration.","Captain Mary stood at the head of the newly assembled thementhis warriors, in their freshly issued minthelian uniforms. They were to be brought in to her contingent. Evidently, general Batherston believed all women were the same. They looked out of place, they were too formal, too straight, and too fearful. She raised her voice.

“You will come to my office, one at a time. Rear rank first.”

They clapped a closed fist across their hearts, evidently their salute, in unison.

//////

As the captain checked her uniform, Saba stood rigid to attention. She adjusted the collar a little as she spoke. Saba had a uniform infraction. She braced up to be punished. She would say the words herself.

“I am ready for my punishment, I have failed in the emperors duty.” 

The captain turned and looked puzzled. “What punishment?”

“Incorrect uniform. Standard punishment, one hit and seven compliance pins, Ma’am.”

“I’m sorry, what?” Even the name sounded horrifying. “What about losing your weapon?”

“Simulated drowning, five minutes, Ma’am.”

“Capture?”

“300 lashes, Ma’am.”

“Delay in following an order?”

“Death, Ma’am.”

Mary was horrified. “And what was your training?”

Saba remembered the training well. It had been agonising. “Pain prevents im-Proper practices, ma’am.”

“You can stop calling me Ma’am.”

“Standard punishment, one compliance pin, Ma’am.”

“What did you do before the regiment?”

Mary got her answer. Like the rest of the unit, a hundred thousand of them had been drafted at age 12, to form the army unit. They had been continually beaten, tortured into model cannon fodder soldiers. Lashes, simulated drowning, pain-causing drugs, and the control pins, a tally counted by soldiers before their machine time, where a device would insert miniature needles into them, and cause them agonized pain. This one was 23. She looked a decade older. She made her decision. A moment later she stood outside, in front of all of them.

“As of this moment, I formally rescind all of the regulations of your regiment, aside from following my orders, you will follow new regulations. And that means there will be no drowning, no beatings, and no lashes. You will all remain here, and then read the new regulations, which I shall shortly produce. All clear?”

They stood silent. Then Saba, at the back, spoke up. “Yes,” she said, and sat down. Mary watched as the others slowly realised they could too, and copied. She disappeared back inside. Now she just had to write some regulations down.

//////

“We need a way to make the uniforms uniquely yours.” Tammy wondered aloud as she sat with Saba, Isla and Xeme for her lunch. They were still quiet, but they did at least talk more now than they had before, as they were being integrated as one block before being assigned into the units of minthelians. They wore the uniform straight laced, and their complexion was different, but there needed to be an better differentiator. 

“Headbands?” Xeme asked, her speech still the curt, to-the-point style as before.

“Maybe,” Tammy wondered. 

“The chest pips?” Saba suggested. 

It was a good idea, but how. Tammy wracked her brains. Rose had some white nail polish. Hazel’s watercolour set. Some melted lime scraped off a few local buildings. This could work. 

//////

“Right, Girls,” Maxy began, rifle in hand. “You all know what guns are, but this is a special one. This is the minthelian battle rifle. You hold it, like this. The power cell release is here. With the power cell this way, it shoots at high power, and this way, low power. Use low for supressing fire, and high for big targets. The safety is here, and this is the slide. When you push this forward, that engages the weapon.”

As they set off for some target shooting practice, in the next room, something equally important was happening. Private Elzy pointed to a board.

“These are the main minthelian acronyms used. Learn these ones first, and you will pick up the rest…” as she taught long into the night.

//////

Hope stood across from Saba, both women holding what were effectively stage knives. Hope stepped carefully, but Saba followed her old training and charged into melee. Hope dodged and pressed the knife into her back as the blade retracted. 

“Too eager, again,” she said, backing away, as two more entered the ring. “That’s hardly fair!” Hope began, but they all lunged forward. She got one of them, but the others got her, and wrestled her to the floor as they all began laughing. 

From where they stood at the side, ‘Tauret’, ‘Nalwa’, and ‘Mesi’ laughed with them. The eight real Thementhis warmaidens who had been composited to provide their identities had all been very co-operative in revealing all that was needed to create three fake members of the regiment, last survivors from a squad none of the others knew like all of the prisoners had been. These generous women had been rewarded by a quick death and being quietly fed into a crusher, uniforms looted and carefully tailored for the disguises. Lara, Stephanie, and Klara would wait, and bide their time. The mission for the three elite agents was simple, to take out the most senior officers they could, for the greater good.

Salute to my Brothers,"(Spoken word-posting for a friend to see what ya’ll think.)

Where do we go when we die?
Do outcomes change if we fight?
The world is full of greed and pride.
I lost brothers to murder and suicide.

For them, I will stand and salute.
Respect runs back to our roots.
We symbolize freedom with the American flag.
Yet, the U.S. submits to an incompetent dad.

We live in a place where nothing is cheap.
It’s ironic we call it the land of the free. 
There’s no peace for love, if we keep going to war. 
If we keep fighting each other, faith will never be restored.

We’re losing our families ruled over repetitive kings.
The fight’s never over for those that still dream. 
Politics, violence, drugs, it’s all crowding our streets.
They tax us so high, we then fumble our feet.

Some of us feel like we got nothing to lose.
We’re not given the same options that society loots.
We’re losing our community to new generations,
Who do want to work, but just not for our nation.

Where do we go when we die?
Do outcomes change if we fight?
The world is full of greed and pride.
I lost brothers to murder and suicide.

For them, I will stand and salute.
Respect runs back to our roots.
Why do we shackle indifference in chains?
We are all patriot, it’s the blood in our veins.

Why do we always have to stick to tradition?
Authority treats us like puppets in detention.
We never learn from history. We keep repeating mistakes.
There’s still ignorant people who discriminate, in vain.

Can’t you see we’re being brainwashed by the schools?
They teach about freedom, yet they treat us like fools.
Society falls victim into the government’s pool.
Those who are awake then use conspiracy to duel.

When will we learn that we all bleed the same?
Choosing war and to kill will never be okay.
We’re taught while we’re young to play by the rules.
We enable the government to use us like tools.

Let freedom ring for all those who have fallen.
Same to those who decided against society’s pollen.
When will we finally reach end satisfaction?
How many more bodies will fall, until we learn compassion? 

Stop taking my brothers we’ve resisted enough.
Some never learned what it means to be loved. 
Why do we fight if we’re reaching for peace?
I pray that the earth sees me down on my knees.

Why do the strong like to prey on the weak?
Since when is it wrong to try to be unique?
Why does it matter how we express our beliefs?
Families are ruined yet we don’t share their grief.

We hide behind weapons and light up cigars.
Gun control isn’t the problem, us as people are.
Whats the point of an election if no one even cares?
Our whole world is toxic and in need of repair.

Why did love thy neighbor turn into war?
I understand why God struck and flooded our shores.
We hold on to anger, revolt, and rebel.
We all seek for kindness but our hearts are in jail.

There’s no need, for us, to mimic an individual’s past reflections.
Signing new treaties protect us from losing our direction.
We destroy our own country for money and greed.
It’s time to act now we need to plant new seeds.

We need to be thankful for all that we have.
Instead, we keep planning for the next attack. 
We seek resurrection from idols that sin.
We’re crazy and selfish. When will insanity end?

Why is this world so stuck on revenge?
It makes me so angry my fists won’t unclench.
Is there even a soul here that genuinely cares? 
Or is the entire public having a moral affair?

Why can’t we be fair and learn self control?
Why do our egos seek to dig bigger holes?
We all create problems but are last to forgive.
We should help one another, so that others can live.

Should we heal our country or help it die?
We need to stop the civil and political fights.
Stop being greedy, put a leash on your pride.
Let’s put a halt to the murder and suicide.

For EVERYONE, I will stand and salute.
Respect runs back to our roots.
Why do we shackle indifference in chains?
We are ALL patriot, it’s the blood in our veins.

Where will you go when you die?
You can’t change the outcome with just your mind.
We need to stand up and protest for what’s right.
Change is afoot, by working together and being kind.",1azztsv,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poem/comments/1azztsv/salute_to_my_brothers/,[]

# The Wingbard War

&#x200B;

Falcor was one of the few vassals in the empire that didn’t leave the empire as soon as it had the opportunity. This was mostly down to the fact that the Queen of Falcor, Maximilliana, feared that Falcor would simply fall under Wingbardian influence should it declare independence. Left with the choice between an imperial overlord that had brought peace to Falcor for two centuries or domination by the ancient enemies of the Falcorians, the most despicable Wingbardians, she chose the empire. Like the rest of Griffonia, Falcor’s economy also collapsed with the empire as borders started to matter again. Unlike most of Griffonia, the Falcorian economy bounced back within only a few years since the mostly agrarian nation was not greatly dependent on trade and could simply sell more of its produce to the Herzlands.

The revolution in 978 effectively gave Falcor independence as the empire was now busy fighting for its very life and could no longer afford to garrison Falcor. Due to the nation's trade ties with the Herzlands the Falcorian economy collapsed again, but this time the recovery was much slower. The revolution also meant that Wingbardy could now assert its claims on Falcorian territory, and Falcor was forced to step in to defend itself. The Falcorian army was a modern force, but it did not have nearly the numbers needed to take on Wingbardy and so conscription was introduced, tripling the size of the active army and giving Falcor the ability to mobilize a large force quickly.

In 985, a clash broke out in the border town of Meranclawo. Both sides sent in reinforcements and the clash became a skirmish, the skirmish became a battle and finally the battle became a war.

&#x200B;

**985**

&#x200B;

Thanks to having been first to mobilize and her efficient mobilization system Falcor got to enjoy a three to one advantage over the Wingbardians in the early weeks of the war. Knowing that this would not last, Field Marshal (some Italian name that sounds vaguely like Haig) ordered a front wide offensive to crush the Wingbardians before they could mobilize their forces. This started the 2nd bloodiest two weeks of the war as open combat on a modern battlefield left soldiers no cover from artillery, mortars, machine guns or gunfire. 

Thanks to their superior numbers in men and artillery, the Falcorians suffered only 23.000 casualties compared to the 35.000 on the Wingbardian side, a 50% loss ratio for the Wingbardian troops on the border. Nevertheless the offensive was a failure since reinforcements left the Wingbardians with more numbers in the field than at the beginning of the war. Additionally most of the Falcorian casualties had been with her best professional army units, leaving her with little offensive capabilities. In the weeks following the (offensive) both sides were incapable of offensive action, instead using the time to dig in and replenish their numbers. Thus ended the short but brutal phase of open combat, replaced with slightly less brutal trench warfare. 

&#x200B;

**986**

&#x200B;

Only in February of 986, six months after the war began did the staring contest across no man's land end with the 2nd battle of Meranclawo. The Wingbardians had long realized this would be a war of attrition and had planned their offensive accordingly. 

The battle began with an hours-long bombardment from 500 pieces of artillery, followed by an assault from 3 infantry divisions. The assault faced fierce resistance from the Falcorians whose trenchworks had mostly survived the bombardment but the outnumbered Falcorians were still pushed back to their second trench line by the end of the first day. On the 2nd and 3rd day the offensive slowly ground down, giving the Falcorians time to reinforce their positions and bring in their artillery, evening the field. Even as mountains of casualties piled up on both sides neither was willing to accept defeat so the battle went on for months longer. During the 3rd month of the battle the Falcorians introduced poison gas to the battlefield which was soon also adopted by the Wingbardians. The 2nd battle of Meranclawo only ended in December of 986 as by then the Wingbardians had firmly exhausted themselves.

Behind the lines Falcor was struggling along as the war economy and mobilization were putting the already poor peasantry into even more dire positions. These conditions were fertile grounds for republicanism and communism to fester and spread. Meanwhile, Griffonstone was watching the events in Falcor with great interest, sensing both the opportunity to return Falcor to the empire and also the threat a republican Falcor would pose to the imperial position. Consequently Griffonstone began sending military and economic aid to Falcor so as to alleviate the situation there.

&#x200B;

**987**

&#x200B;

Thanks to the imperial aid Falcor was in a much better position and could finally prepare an offensive of its own to knock out the Wingbardians for good. This was to be achieved by attacking the weak left side of the Wingbardian front and exploiting any breakthrough with relatively light infantry formations. Once the offensive began in March of 987 the weak 2nd Army was quickly overwhelmed in the battle of Clawporetto. Within only three weeks the Falcorians advanced the frontline more than 20 kilometers deep into Wingbardy, even encircling and wiping out two divisions. The success of the offensive could have ended the war, were it not for the flooding of the Piumave River which gave the 2nd Army the time it needed to rebuild its defenses.

For all the victories it brought, the offensive had come at the great cost of nearly 50.000 casualties. Additionally, the offensive had only been possible due to the withdrawal of several divisions from the right side of the front where the Falcorians consequently were heavily outnumbered. Once the Wingbardians caught wind of their weakness attacked with devastating success, especially on the right flank where the 4th Army managed to cut the rail connection between Sudfolc and Falcor and the 3rd Army advanced ever closer to Falcor.

In June, the heavy casualties taken in the prior three months, the bad living conditions on the front and in general and an unwillingness to fight for feudal lords lead to a wave of desertion and rebellion in the army. In a desperate attempt to restore morale for at least a few weeks, Queen Maximilliana promised democracy to her subjects. This restored some semblance of order to the army enabling one last desperate counterattack.

In their advance on Falcor and Sudfolc respectively, a three kilometer gap had opened between the 3rd and 4th armies. Erika Feveros, who at that time was only commander of a single battalion, exploited this gap to get behind the 3rd Army and attack it from behind. This caused sufficient chaos to stall their advance for just long enough to allow the forces in Falcor to launch their offensive which managed to push back the Wingbardians back out of artillery range from Falcor.

While Falcor was struggling to stay alive, the vultures in Sicameon used the opportunity to seize the JoJo islands. Falcor was unable to react to this, but it was able to call out to the empire for aid. As tensions between the empire and republic had slowly decreased after 985, Griffonstone finally felt ready to intervene directly. The empire also drew in Cyanolisia which had been waiting for a good casus-belli against Sicameon ever since the War of Asterionese Independence. This started another war, the JoJo War, between the empire and its vassals / allies of Falcor and Cyanolisia on the one and Sicameon and Asterion on the other side.

Seeing as Falcor was just weeks away from total defeat, the empire wasted no time and immediately sent 350.000 soldiers to the front under the command of General Cornelio Galluzzo. This drastically changed the balance of forces from one somewhat favoring the Wingbardians to one favoring the empire and Falcor. Yet, Gen. Galluzzo did not use this advantage for the time being, instead replacing most Falcorian units on the frontline so as to enable the Falcorian army to rebuild itself. Thus, the Wingbardians continued to have more troops on the frontline even as they had inferior numbers in total. Still, now that they no longer had an advantage in resources they were much more reserved with offensive operations for the rest of the year, only launching a few small offensives to secure their grip over the Falcor-Sudfolc rail line.

&#x200B;

**988/989**

&#x200B;

The imperial intervention in the war led to a panic in Wingbardy as the war suddenly seemed both impossible to win and to be about national survival. The prospect of losing their independence rallied the Wingbardians better than even their hatred of Falcorians had, and even the socialists and communists that so far had been fervently opposed to the war aligned with the Monarchy, favoring the bourgeois democracy to the feudalistic empire. With newfound morale and another wave of freshly trained troops Wingbardy entered 988 with a force that could and would still fight. Additionally, WIngbardy also tried to put pressure on Francis VIII. to join the war, but Francis refused due to the threat of an Aquilean intervention to retake Tarrin.

988 had battered the Falcorian army so thoroughly that it took almost a full year for it to fully recover. While some forces har been ready to fight again as early as October of 988, those were used to staff the relatively inactive front with Sicameon. Overall this meant that for the first few months of 988 the Wingbardians would retain their advantage in numbers, but as soon as the Falcorian army would be back in the fight the Wingbardians would be outnumbered very heavily.

The Wingbardians, very aware of this, planned one major offensive for the year to inflict high enough casualties on the empire to convince it that the war wasn’t worth it and withdraw from the war. Thus in spring of 988 the Wingbardians launched their final offensive, named after their king Garibald. The Garibaldi offensive was supposed to cut the land route to Sudfolc while also taking Falcor as a side objective.

Once the offensive began it quickly became clear that the offensive would not go as planned. The first day of the offensive saw an entire division wiped out and the next few days didn’t go much better as the Wingbardians were torn to shreds under heavy artillery barrages. After only 14 days the offensive was called off due to unsustainable casualties. As it turned out, Gen. Galluzzo had, with considerable help from Gen. Feveros, predicted that the Wingbardians would try to cut off Sudfolc and prepared accordingly. Nearly all of the imperial artillery had been concentrated on the small Wingbardian bridgehead across the Falcor River. And thus, once the Wingbardians attacked from said bridgehead they were under constant bombardment with no shelter. Consequently the attack did not only fail miserably, but half of the 100.000 casualties were deaths. As it was now clear that Wingbardy would lose the war, Talouse, which had joined the war back in 986 and done nothing for the duration of the war, withdrew from the war and signed a ceasefire with the empire.

Not long after the failed Garibald offensive did the Falcorian army finally return to the frontline, cementing the imperial advantage over Wingbardy. As the Falcorians and imperials were growing ever tired of the war they wanted to bring an end to the war as soon as possible. Thus they made sure not to give the Wingbardians much time to recover, and launched their own offensive to end the war. Having learned from years of trench warfare, the Falcorians and imperials finally adapted their tactics to a modern battlefield and implemented so-called “stormtrooper” tactics (developed by a certain Gen. Feveros). Heavily armed knights and tanks would break the enemy line in a given place, after which lighter infantry would exploit the breakthrough and wreak havoc behind enemy lines.

Once the offensive began the stormtrooper tactics proved devastatingly successful. Within only a few weeks the Wingbardian army was pushed back into Wingbardy. The advance was temporarily halted for a few weeks by the bad infrastructure in northern Wingbardy, giving the Wingbardians some time to dig back in. Once imperial engineers had managed to build a proper supply line the offensive continued on. Again, the Wingbardian lines were broken easily. By November the imperials were at Griffano where the Wingbardian 1st Army had dug in. Protected on one side by the Warthog Forest and on the other by (that river) it had to be taken if the imperials were to continue their advance on Karthin. 

The battle of Griffano was the last major battle of the war as the Wingbardians were unwilling to give even an inch of the city and thus contributed all forces they had left to the defense of the city. The battle itself was a slogfest as the imperials didn’t want to risk unnecessary casualties in an assault and thus just kept on shelling the city for months. In February of 989, King Garibald Talonuel III was killed during a front line visit to Griffano. News of his death broke the morale in the city leading to mass desertions. Finally, the Imperials attacked the city which fell with almost no resistance. As the news of Garibald’s death and the fall of Griffano spread, the spirit to fight on  was finally broken. Thus, the Wingbardians signed a ceasefire that put half the country under imperial occupation. 

&#x200B;

**Aftermath of the War**

&#x200B;

While half of Wingbardy was under imperial occupation, the other half was collapsing into civil war. Communist revolutionaries proclaimed proclaimed a Worker’s state in Wrobert and began fighting the liberals, reactionaries were fighting the communists, the conservatives were fighting republicans, the new king was fighting the liberal government, the liberals were trying to hold the country together and what remained of the army was fighting everyone and itself. 

The imperial government originally had planned to just annex Wingbardy, but seeing the absolute state it was in it did not wish to get any more involved than it had to be for any longer than it had to be. Thus, the empire left as soon as it formally ended the war with the Treaty of Karthin. In exchange for Independence, Wingbardy ceded Asbolus, and much of the borderlands up to the Warhog River, dissolved the Karthinian Pact, ceded its fleet to Cyanolisia, (promised to) demilitarize and was to pay millions in reparations. Knowing that the government that signed the treaty would collapse as soon as the imperial occupation ended, the empire demanded all of its reparations be paid immediately. However Wingbardy was at this point all but bankrupt, so it instead had to pay its debts by handing over what assets it had, foreign and domestic, to the empire.

The chaos of the Wingbardian Civil War gave Francis VIII an opening to seize the crown of Wingbardy for himself like he had done with Tarrin a decade before. In spring of 990, Francis crossed the Folino and began his invasion of Wingbardy, adding another side to the war there. As he had a professional army he was easily the strongest of all belligerents and quickly managed to take control of Karthin. 

Conquering the rest of Wingbardy proved not to be so easy as he spent the next two years in fighting the communists in Wrobert all the while having to put down uprisings in Wingbardy and Tarrin. In an act representative of the whole war Francis VIII torched Wrobert to the ground after finally conquering it. This act and the many others like it that occurred during the invasion and civil war caused immense destruction to the nation, killed many tens of thousands and displaced millions, causing a refugee crisis in southern Griffonia.",1azziqo,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/equestriaatwar/comments/1azziqo/exiles_at_war_the_wingbard_war/,[]
"Me and a friend investigated the Bristol Hum back in 2021, and we may have found the source","For those who don't know about the Bristol Hum, imagine a pulsating throbbing low pitch sound, like an air turbulance or that sort of sound you hear in horror movies before something bad happens, as you can guess, it can be annoying, and best of all? no one knows the cause, there have been various investigations over the years and supposed recordings along with hypothesis after hypothesis, yet no one knows the true cause, and it's made stranger by the fact that the hum isn't just in Bristol, or the UK, or Europe, it's been heard all over the world.

&#x200B;

Me and one friend (who we'll call M) started hearing the hum back in 2020 during the lockdowns, exclusively at night, the day after the first night i heard it i phoned M up and his first words? 'dude what was that strange sound last night'

&#x200B;

And for the next year, we continued to hear it, and that's when our interest in finding the cause increased, our attempts at recording it were in vain, but we did manage to get something with the help of a friend who works in audio, we tried to use special microphones to find a bearing of the sound, but it seemed like it was coming from every direction.

&#x200B;

One night the hum was particularly strong so the next day i had an interesting proposition for M, to investigate it, to assemble a small group and leave our comfort zone to find the source once and for all, so the next day i texted all my friends, expecting at least a few to decline.

&#x200B;

But it turned out that they'd all been hearing it since 2020 and were just as interested, and so we all agreed, to prepare and wait for a night where it's bad again and hunt it down, you see, the hum isn't as bad every night and some nights it's not there at all, it's one aspect about it that can drive you insane and leave you wondering if you just imagined it.

&#x200B;

Over the next few weeks we got our equipment and plans together, sound engineer friend, S, supplied us with recorders and microphones, a friend who liked airsoft, T, provided us with two way radios, torches and a military grade NVG (PVS-14) for me at least, the rest of the crew got night vision camcorders.

&#x200B;

We all coordinated it like a military operation, my job, since i had the night vision device, was just to keep an eye out, while recording the hum making notes with my recorder, S would attempt to narrow down the direction of the sound and give us areas to investigate, M would be providing backup for me and focus on videoing the action, T would keep track of where we were and would be the first to investigate any potential sources before we went in further, finally a techie friend, B, kept an eye on our locations with FindMyiPhone and monitored and recorded our radio communications all from home.

&#x200B;

Our plan was simple, wait for a night when the hum was strong by 12 AM and if we all heard it, we were to bring our equipment and rendezvous at a nearby park, starting our search from there.

&#x200B;

Every night we made sure to keep our batteries charged, and followed Ts strong advice not to burn out his NVD by using it during the day, it took a few nights, but finally the night came.

&#x200B;

Quickly texting my friends, they all confirmed they heard it too, some even texted before me, X was notified, and i grabbed my recorder, phone, NVD, torch and made my way to the park.

&#x200B;

The rendezvous went perfectly, we met up and setup and tested our equipment, everything on and recording, we started off, the hum sounded kind of different outside, and S had found an ever so slightly stronger hum signature towards the west, in the back of my mind it occured to me that it could just be ships but there was no turning back now.

&#x200B;

We advanced westward down the Avon, S still reported the hum was stronger towards the west, soon we passed the S.S Great Britain, but according to S no sound signature was coming from her, and my NVD showed nothing, we continued advancing for an hour and a half, and soon the city of bristol was behind us, and we were on the near the leigh woods between bristol and the dock, heading towards the clifton bridge.

&#x200B;

Suddenly our radios crackled into life with the voice of B.

&#x200B;

'This is control, comm check, comm check, 123' control was what we called B over the radios.

&#x200B;

'What is your 10-20, i repeat what is your 10-20'

&#x200B;

10-20 is old CB codewords for location so i replied

&#x200B;

'Just wanted to warn you that your signal is dipping, i estimate you will have no comms back to me if you go beyond the bridge, i advise keeping to high ground'

&#x200B;

We heeded Bs warning and continued on, keeping away from the edge of the Avon while trying to stick to higher ground, it was pitch black and the PVS-14 was doing a great job of making sure i could see, what i didn't realize was the hum was becoming increasingly louder and it was being picked up clearly on all our recorders, the reports from S solidified that, and we were just a few hundred yards away from the bridge when i noticed the hum, it was strongest i'd heard it.

&#x200B;

S moved even closer to the bridge and reported that it seemed to be coming from across the avon, somewhere in or near leigh woods.

&#x200B;

We all focused our equipment across the gorge, but i couldn't really see anything out of the ordinary, to my perspective it just looked like when you see night vision being used in the woods, creepy, but nothing obvious popped out as an immediate threat.

&#x200B;

We stood around investigating for a while, not finding much of anything, we decided to backtrack to investigate leigh woods, we found our way on the other side of the avon gorge and kept following the hum, it seemed to be getting much stronger, you could almost feel it.

&#x200B;

The whole group descended into leigh wood and that's when we noticed it, aside from the hum, there was no other sounds, the woods seemed devoid of any animal life, i looked around the woods, and up at the night sky, i thought i noticed a little structure in the distance, and S's sound equipment showed the strongest signature yet eminating from that direction.

&#x200B;

It was at this point that M started telling me he was getting a bad feeling, we had fearless almost the entire investigation up to this point, i did too think something was disagreeable about the hum, something not right, but i quickly snapped out of it, it's just a strange sound, that's all.

&#x200B;

We slowly advanced towards the small structure with T at the front of the group, at it drew closer it seemed little more then a small wooden shed, the kind you would see in someones back garden, a familar sight, in an otherwise creepy landscape, yet i did feel as though bad vibes were coming from the shed, i dismissed it as infrasound from the hum, infrasound is supposedly a pitch of sound that can cause feelings of anxiety, creepiness, and paranoia, and the hum apparently produces it.

&#x200B;

At this point it felt extreamly strong, it felt like it was eminating from the shed, and indeed T said he could almost feel it with his hand against the wood work.

&#x200B;

The shed was up against a tree, and the four windows on one side seemed to have been painted over, none of us could see what was in there, when we peered in with our night vision devices and torches.

&#x200B;

The front and only door was locked, by an old fashioned lever-type padlock, it was here our radios lit up with a crackly tranmission, barely understandable, it was from B, another comm check, we told him of the shed, the padlock, the painted over windows, B told us that he would continue tracking us, but radio communication might be hard or impossible any further out, saying the trees were blocking the signal.

&#x200B;

We looked at the shed and wondered if and how we should effect an entry, none of us knew lock picking, so that was out of the question, T told us that if we really wanted to see the source of the hum, put a stop to it and possibly even end up in the news, we were going to have to break in.

&#x200B;

T, who was the kind of person to do an SAS-type raid on his own house, and the person assigned to go in before us, happily obliged to do it, every kick of that wooden door sent a loud rattling bang across the gorge, it seemed much louder then the hum, almost like a gun going off, and i wondered what gossip there would be tomorrow of the hum and apparent gunshots, the hum didn't even seem that loud, but S said those low pitch sounds can travel far and wide, like a ships horn, and that the sound of our forced entry wasn't going that far.

&#x200B;

With every kick the wood seemed to weaken and on the fifth kick, the wood around the shackle gave way and lock flew off, the door didn't burst open, as it was an outward opening door.

&#x200B;

T put his foot in the door, and after a count of three, swung the door open.

&#x200B;

Our equipment focused on the space as T went in first, it looked like a typical shed, a shelf hung below the windows, we all checked for signs of security cameras, but there was nothing, save for a small box we went through, and it just contained old car parts, some old gaskets, a stereo, filters, and some aftermarket steering wheel.

&#x200B;

We were all just going to leave when T suggested something:

&#x200B;

'Wait a minute, move the box, don't ask why, just move it'

&#x200B;

I shifted the box across the small space and to my surprise, there was a hatch.

&#x200B;

'I thought so' T said

&#x200B;

T again, obliged to lift the hatch, as we watched and filmed on, all i saw down there was a blizzard against an inky black sky, the achilies heel of passive image amplification, according to T, was true darkness, not star or moonlight, so we'd all need our camcorders night vision, which are like invisible torches switched on, according to T, the NVDs were capable of seeing this infrared night vision.

&#x200B;

T descended on a dodgy old ladder and came down to a small space with an indescript piece of machinery, the hum seemed to eminate out of this hole, from this machine, we all descended after T deemed it was safe.

&#x200B;

The space was no bigger then the shed itself, the machine seemed to vibrate with the humming, and sheets of paper littered the floor, we walked over to one corner, where was a little table with an old book on it, it looked victorian, like the kind of book that would contain a 19th century engineering text.

&#x200B;

It was blank on the cover but the first page was signed by I.K Brunel, the late great engineer, and most of the book, written in latin with some english, mixed in with depictions of whatever the pump-like steampunk apparatus behind us was, thinking back now, it had a thick wire extending straight into the earth.

&#x200B;

We did find manage to find some english writing in the book, reading by torch because that PVS made it almost impossible to read close up.

&#x200B;

'Such an apparatus shall gurantee the west country if not the entire world a certain security from the beast'

&#x200B;

The word beast was underlined, but a werid book was never going to put a stop to the sound that has quizzed the world over, so T went up to it and grabbing a lever like you would see on an old steam locomotive, squeezed the trigger and pulled it.

&#x200B;

Just like that the hum stopped, it was now 3:30 in the morning, we left, but not before taking the book with us.

&#x200B;

As we exited the shed to a hum free world, we radioed B and told him of what we did, we would be in the news, for sure, and no doubt soon people who knew what they were actually doing would descend upon the machine.

&#x200B;

But we never got that far, for as we were walking across Leigh Wood, i caught sight of a huge inky black mass beyond a tree line, we stopped, it was like a dog almost as big as a car, and even though the NVD it seemed entirely black.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, it turned toward us, two eyes seemed to give off an immense amount of infrared light, temporarily blinding me with the NVD, and according to T 'caused them to go into autogated bright source protection mode but it still burned two dots into the tube' when i regained my vision all i remember is shouting 'Run Run Run!' and we took off, running back towards bristol.

&#x200B;

We felt a presence much worse then the hum, thinking back at this point the hum was almost benign, we ran, but we were soon stopped by a figure in victorian dress near a tree.

&#x200B;

A figure who looked a lot like I.K Brunel and who seemed to freeze time as he spoke.

&#x200B;

'I am the late brunel, and i come here because i know you switched my apparatus off, that... machine, protects the world'

&#x200B;

'Protects the world from what? not being annoyed?' M said

&#x200B;

'From the beast, let me tell you a little story, you know that in September of Eighteen Fifty Nine i ceased to be, such is true, but what has never been told is three years before, September of Eighteen Fifty Six, i saw the beast in this very wood, the hound, he is, sent to collect the souls of those whose contract have expired, i knew not long was left after i saw the beast, so between designing my great ship i should never see fully built, work i did upon this machine, putting it into action was the last thing i did before i fell too ill'

&#x200B;

'The hum though!' T joined in

&#x200B;

'A ghost can neither maintain nor oil a machine, so it is not my fault, but the likes of the great tesla would later improve its powers by way of the so called herztian rays, which were found early on to deter the supernatural'

&#x200B;

'Indeed' The continued

&#x200B;

'If you looked more upon that book of yours, which i ask back, you may find another half of it is written by the great Nikola Tesla'

&#x200B;

We handed back the book, and with that, the ghost vanished into thin air, and so did the hound, we looked behind, and the little shed was gone.

&#x200B;

We got into contact with B, who said he had been trying to contact us for an hour, it was now 4:30, and we made our way back to bristol without a problem, apart from the ever present hum that had returned.

&#x200B;

The next day we checked our recordings, but it was as if the recordings around the time of finding the shed were deleted, no camera or recorder had any recording of it, it was always us walking into leigh wood, then cut to us walking back to bristol, that's it, Bs recording of our comms was normal, but again there was no mention of a shed, or padlock, just B telling the void that the signal was weak.

&#x200B;

The FindMyiPhone logs were of no help either, showing that we went no where near where we think the little shed was.

&#x200B;

Nor did any of S's equipment capture anything, it was the same story, hum, but the shed, the ghost, the book, none of it.

&#x200B;

But the only reason i write this three years after, is because last night, i dreamed of a large black dog, with [red eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/search/?q=subreddit%3Anosleep%20author%3Anocommunication7&restrict_sr=1).

[BECOMING ZO'AN] Chapter 10 - Overwatch,"As the overwatch vehicles barrels through the wastelands of a forgotten city, Dante is realizing the gravity of the situation. Commander Preston said something about the locations of Krix outposts. Those probably aren't so easy to come across. Is the information worth sacrificing the lives of highly skilled operators?

“Hold here!” Cassie yells out to the driver, setting a waypoint on everyone’s HUD that is positioned atop a collapsed skyscraper. 

With a sudden jerk, the vehicle mounts the sloped face of the building, hauling against the mud that’s buried its exterior. With little effort, the vehicle reaches the waypoint and drifts to a stop. Without delay, the vehicle locks in, slowly lifting the wheels off the ground as the support beams lift into place. Shortly after this, the ceiling of the vehicle opens and all of their seats rise up above the roof of the van. 

Each of the recruits are startled as the vehicle turns into an overwatch center, with monitors in front of each member and a clear view of a large portion of the landscape.

“Switching to over watch,” Cassie says as the colors on Dante’s HUD switch to Orange. Without much delay, the orange outline of four soldiers appears far in the distance, and deep below a mountain of rubble. The blue waypoint set by the squad of operators blinks ahead of them, at the base of the skyscraper. 

“Overwatch engaged,” Cassie calls out.

“Talk to me O2,” Commander Preston orders.

“Are you- position, Sir?”

_Debugging concludes: “Are you in position, Sir?”

“Affirmative,” Commander Preston confirms.

“Copy that, Commander. Running the package to you,”

The four outlines blink off and a sudden noise erupts in the comms as a massive vibration ripples through the area, the shockwave even traveling through the overwatch vehicle in the distance. Briefly after the initial burst, an amalgamation of rubble and buildings suddenly cave into the ground, like a massive manhole swallowing a portion of the landscape.

“O2?!” Commander Preston panics.

He continues calling out for the squad as all of the recruits wait in angst, avoiding the thought of the operators having died. Or worse, dying with the data.

Shit. Dante’s mind worries as he anxiously taps his foot.

“Mission Control, have you got a read on O2?” Preston asks.

“Negative, Commander,” Mission control responds amongst a sea of noise. “Should we prepare to infiltrat-”

“Negative,” Preston cuts off mission control. “I'm not giving them any more of us,”

Everyone glares at the rubble with desperate eyes, squinting with hopes to see the slightest hint of O2’s plan coming to fruition. But, as the fog drops and the rubble comes back into view, the stillness of the area sends a discomforting message.

Cassie sighs, aggressively rubbing her forehead as Mission Control says, “It looks likd the mission's a bust,”

Commander Preston sighs alongside her, still glaring at the last position of O2. “Let’s mo-”

“I’ve got one!” Cassie yells as she takes off her headphones and shifts the communications console away from her. With a few swipes of her hand, she shares the orange outline of a lone soldier, crawling his way to the waypoint. “Dante, Nadia. On me!” Cassie yells as she leaps out of the vehicle.

Dante and Nadia both hesitantly exit the vehicle behind Cassie, trying to keep up with her as she slides down the side of the building. “His vitals are reading positive,” She yells in excitement.

“Be advised, there are hostiles on O2’s six,” Commander Prestons voice warns over the comms.

“Copy that,” She says, “Keep up you two!” She adds as her feet touch the ground and she starts sprinting in the targets direction.

Nadia leaps from a few meters above the ground to catch up, barrel rolling safely as she lands behind Cassie and Dante follows suits- catching up with them and seeing the targets outline is just over five hundred metres away amongst the ground level smog of the explosion. Reducing vision to a few metres ahead of them.

Cassie raises her fist, and the two recruits stop in their tracks. She reaches behind her back and pulls out a scanning grenade. Upon pulling the pin and tossing it into the thick grey mist, a brief explosion pulses a laser through the area- immediately highlighting a swell of over twenty units marked in red.

Dante’s heart drops as he immediately wonders why Cassie would bring him here if he isn't ready yet. He’s still learning to deal with one target- twenty is insane. The red dots slowly begin to fade one by one- the Outer Wall System is struggling to track the targets through the smoke.

Without a sound, a few lasers beam through the mist- barely whizzing past Dante and Nadia.

“They firing blind?” Dante panics.

“Who says they're blind?” Cassie responds before stepping forward.

As her foot touches the ground, another laser barrels through the smoke and Cassie slightly tilts her head to dodge it.

“Dante, use eighty percent of you mana on a shield,” She orders.

“Eighty percent?” Dante panics, wondering how he’ll fight with only the remaining twenty.

“That’s an order!”

Dante immediately casts a curved energy wall ahead of the three of them-

_HP: 100

_MANA: 20% REMAINING

_DETAILS: 16/80

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 100%

A few lasers deflect off the shield, and Dante can feel the intensity of the blasts chip away at the shield strength quicker than any of the blasts at the academy.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 84%

“So, they can see us but not the target,” Cassie says curiously.

“I don't think my shield is strong enough,” Dante says.

“Then let’s move!” She says as she starts jogging towards the target, forcing Nadia and Dante in a jog as well.

_TARGET DISTANCE: 400m

_TARGET DISTANCE: 300m

Without a sound, Cassie’s energy blades emerge from her arms and her head darts around, searching amongst the grey smoke surrounding them. Out of the fog, a mechanical beast like that of a giant spider lashes a claw from the grey- striking the shield and sending a heavy vibration through Dante’s body before it disappears back into the cloud.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 61%

Cassie darts through the shield, exposing herself to the abyss when the creature steps up again, raising three claws to strike Cassie- but she is much to quick, and the creature suddenly splits into two when Cassie steps behind the shield. Avoiding the sudden burst of lasers that collides with it.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 43%

_TARGET DISTANCE: 200m

“Nadia, you're up,” Cassie says, pinging the waypoint of the target.

“What do you mean?” Nadia asks in a panic.

“Grab the target with your whips,” She says sternly.

“We’re too far,” She stammers.

“Another fifty metres?” Cassie asks.

“Uhh, sure,” Nadia shakes her head.

Cassie dashes forwards with her energy blades, swiping them into the air as two spherical machines fly into view. One of them gets a shot off but shortly after it, both machines drop to the floor in multiple pieces. 

I can't even see her attacks!

Three more flying spheres emerge, firing in their direction and Cassie successfully takes down one of them before stepping behind the shield for cover.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 32%

These one's keep firing at the shield, sending a gust of concern through Dante as he realizes they've been focusing on taking down the shield. Multiple beams emerge from the distance too, all hitting the shield at the same point.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 20%

Cassie darts at the bots while they-re firing and before they can turn to her they both crash to the ground.

“Now!” Cassie yells, pinging the target once again as the orange outline of a soldier glows amongst the smoke filled area.

_TARGET DISTANCE: 120m

Nadia takes a deep breath as the energy whips drop from the PEG’s around her arms and she steps right up to the edge of the shield before twirling the whip into a lasso above her head and casting it out into the gray.

“Got him!” She confirms as she tightens her grip and starts reeling the whips back into her arms.

“Dante, retreat,” Cassie orders.

Dante slowly starts walking backward, shielding the lasers that continue converging at it's center as Nadia reels in the surviving member of O2. As the orange outline gets closer and closer, Cassie continues scanning the area before locking her eyes straight ahead of them.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 12%

The soldiers body emerges past the shield, and Nadia helps him to his feet as they continue jogging back to the vehicle.

“He’s taken serious injuries,” She says as he groans in pain.

“Just get back to th-” Cassie stops in her tracks, and stares ahead of them again. The lasers have stopped too, and an air of discomfort washes over the areas as it falls to silence.

“Sending evac,” Commander Preston says, only adding to Nadia and Dante’s discomfort.

The sound of heavy, mechanical footsteps start chugging in their direction as the sound picks up pace- growing louder and louder.

Cassie empowers her blades the moment a large, humanoid robot jumps out of the smoke and busts Dante’s shield into pieces with a punch to the weak point.

_SHIELD DESTROYED

“Ah!” Dante yells as a surge of pain penetrates the arm he used to cast the shield.

_HP: 73 (-27)

_NOTE: Sustained muscular damage to dominant arm.

_MANA: 20% REMAINING

_DETAILS: 16/80

A sudden swath of nearly a dozen bots dash from behind the humanoid machine. In a panic, Dante uses the remaining mana to cast another shield around them that immediately sustains damage.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 64%

_HP: 73 (-27)

_MANA: 0% REMAINING

_DETAILS: 0/800

_NOTE: Combat environment detected- Regenerate mana ASAP.

“Keep moving,” Cassie yells out as she faces off with the humanoid robot. 

Dante and Nadia keep running back to the vehicle as the occasional glance over his shoulders gives Dante the impression that Cassie isn't handling that robot as easily as the others. In fact, this ones managed to strike at her multiple times, even prompting her into a defensive stance.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 48%

A support vehicle drifts in front of Dante and Nadia with a back door open and the gattling gun on top of it fires into the smoke to provide them with cover fire. As they enter the vehicle with the O2 survivor, Dante sends his shield towards Cassies blue outline and without much time, he notices her run in their direction, using the shield as cover.

_SHIELD STRENGTH: 26%

“Good job, recruits,” The O2 soldiers says.

With a concerned look on her face, Nadia looks back at him and asks “Where’s the rest of your squad?” before Cassie dives into the backseat of the evac truck. 

_SHIELD DISABLED

“Go, Go, Go!” Cassie orders as the door shuts and the vehicle launches out of the area.
