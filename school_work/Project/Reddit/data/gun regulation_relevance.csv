Supreme Court allows Biden ‘ghost gun’ regulations,,15loz1r,2306,444,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-allows-biden-ghost-gun-regulations-rcna97310,"[""In brief: Ghost guns, in this context, are the kits that can be acquired as a disassembled gun, and then you can put the gun together at home.  They have no traceable parts, no serial numbers, hence they're gaining popularity.\n\nThe Biden administration says the kits are in fact firearms and as such subject to the same regulations as any actual assembled and sold gun.\n\nOf course, the kit makers and gun rights activists don't like that, and in Texas:\n\n>But in Texas, Judge Reed O’Connor came to the opposite conclusion in a case brought by Jennifer VanDerStok and Michael Andren, people who own components that they want to use to build guns. Plaintiffs also include gun rights groups and makers and sellers of ghost guns.\n\nToday the Supreme Court knocked that down:\n\n>The court in a brief order put on hold a July 5 ruling by a federal judge in Texas that blocked the regulations nationwide.\n\n>The vote was 5-4, with conservatives Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the three liberal justices in the majority.\n\nSo the kits are now required to do all the things a 'real' gun has to go through to get sold.\n\nIt seems to be a logical conclusion, but of course, everyone has their opinion and right to it.\n\nCarry on. \n\n/or not, if you're not a gun person..."", 'So it is still ok to buy an unfinished receiver and a separate  drill kit to finish the receiver and then buy the rest of the parts separately?', 'I thought the analogies given in this [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/supreme-court-biden-ghost-guns.html) were funny, but thought provoking:\n\n>In the government’s emergency application, Ms. Prelogar asked the justices to consider an analogy.\n\n>“Every speaker of English would recognize that a tax on sales of ‘bookshelves’ applies to Ikea when it sells boxes of parts and the tools and instructions for assembling them into bookshelves,” she wrote.\n\n>A Supreme Court brief from one set of challengers said the comparison was flawed.\n\n>“A better analogy would be to a ‘taco kit’ sold as a bundle by a grocery store that includes taco shells, seasoning packets, salsa and other toppings, along with a slab of raw beef,” the brief said. “No one would call the taco kit a taco. In addition to ‘assembly,’ turning it into one would require cutting or grinding and cooking the meat — and until that was done, it would be nonsensical to treat it as food and the equivalent of a taco.”', 'The ""ghost gun"" industry obviously did not pay their bribes.

#Handgun permits

The Supreme Court [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf) 6-3 Thursday that states may not limit who can carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home, creating a new legal test in the process.

The case, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, involves New York’s law that to obtain a concealed carry permit, an individual needs to prove an elevated need for self-defense (e.g. specific threats against a person’s life). This kind of statute is not unique to the state; California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey—encompassing a quarter of the U.S. population—also have such a law (and the lowest [firearm mortality rates](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm) in the country).

In New York’s case, the law has been on the books for over 100 years. This was not long enough for the conservatives on the Supreme Court, however. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, held that any gun control law must be “consistent with this nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”

>We reiterate that the standard for applying the Second Amendment is as follows: When the Second Amendment’s plain text covers an individual’s conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual’s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment’s “unqualified command.” 

In practice, this means that empirical evidence cannot be used by the courts to uphold gun control laws. The lethality or proliferation of a certain type of weapon, for example, no longer has any bearing on the legality of gun control. Real-world impact means nothing, because the majority is only looking backwards. What time frame does Thomas want us to live in? The courts must ask if there is a “historical analogue” from 1791 (when the Second Amendment was ratified) or 1868 (when the 14th Amendment was ratified). 

>Throughout modern Anglo-American history, the right to keep and bear arms in public has traditionally been subject to well-defined restrictions governing the intent for which one could carry arms, the manner of carry, or the exceptional circumstances under which one could not carry arms. But apart from a handful of late 19th-century jurisdictions, the historical record compiled by respondents does not demonstrate a tradition of broadly prohibiting the public carry of commonly used firearms for self-defense. Nor is there any such historical tradition limiting public carry only to those law-abiding citizens who demonstrate a special need for self-defense. We conclude that respondents have failed to meet their burden to identify an American tradition justifying New York’s proper cause requirement. 

Further, if a law targets a social problem that existed at the Founding but in a different way for today's world, that's evidence in support of a claim that gun regulation is unconstitutional:

>For instance, when a challenged regulation addresses a general societal problem that has persisted since the 18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical regulation addressing that problem is relevant evidence that the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the Second Amendment. Likewise, if earlier generations addressed the societal problem, but did so through materially different means, that also could be evidence that a modern regulation is unconstitutional.

Now, lest you think the court is freezing gun rights in the 18th and 19th centuries like it is gun control, Thomas added that “even though the Second Amendment’s definition of ‘arms’ is fixed according to its historical understanding, that general definition covers modern instruments that facilitate armed self-defense.” 

Justice Breyer, writing a dissent joined by Kagan and Sotomayor, notes that the Court invalidates all modern deaths and injuries caused by gun violence:

>In my view, when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms…At a minimum, I would not strike down the law based only on the pleadings, as the
Court does today—without first allowing for the development of an evidentiary record and without considering the State’s compelling interest in preventing gun violence. 
 
Justice Alito, in his own concurring opinion, snidely asks Breyer if New York’s handgun permitting law would have stopped the Buffalo massacre:

>Why, for example, does the dissent think it is relevant to recount the mass shootings that have occurred in recent years? Does the dissent think that laws like New York’s prevent or deter such atrocities? Will a person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that it is illegal to carry a handgun
outside the home? And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.

#Miranda

The Supreme Court also [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-499_gfbh.pdf) Thursday that individuals cannot sue law enforcement officials for using a statement obtained without a Miranda warning at trial.

The case, Vega v. Tekoh, involves a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who questioned a suspect, Terence Takoh, for an alleged sexual assault. The deputy, Carlos Vegas, obtained a “written statement apologizing for inappropriately touching [a] patient’s genitals,” but without informing Tekoh of his Miranda rights. Tekoh was arrested and charged but acquitted in both instances. He then sued Vega for violating his constitutional rights.

* Note that, according to Tekoh, Vega also used threats and intimidation to extract a confession. “Vega threatened Tekoh with violence, flashing his gun,” a [brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-499/220387/20220406105332804_21-499%20Vega%20v%20Tekoh%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) filed with the Supreme Court detailed. “He warned Tekoh, an immigrant, that he and his family members would face deportation back to the country he and his family had fled in fear of persecution. And he called Tekoh a ‘Jungle Nigger.’...Vega would not permit Tekoh to leave the room, and he ignored Tekoh’s pleas to see a lawyer or talk to his co-workers and supervisors.”

The Ninth Circuit held that the “use of an un-Mirandized statement against a defendant in a criminal proceeding violates the Fifth Amendment and may support a §1983 claim” against the officer who obtained the statement. 

The Supreme Court disagreed. Justice Alito, writing for the conservative majority, held that “[a] violation of Miranda is not itself a violation of the Fifth Amendment.” This is in direct opposition to the origin case for Miranda rights, [Miranda v. Arizona](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/436/). As the Court wrote in 1966, individuals questioned by police must be given “a full and effective warning of his rights at the outset of the interrogation process” as a “safeguard…to secure the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against self-incrimination.”

>...the following procedures to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege must be observed: the person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he has the right to remain silent, and that anything he says will be used against him in court; he must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation, and that, if he is indigent, a lawyer will be appointed to represent him. 

Justice Alito’s opinion expresses clear disdain for Miranda rights, calling it “a bold and controversial claim of authority” for a “judicially crafted rule.” He adds that the Court will follow Miranda’s rationale only “for the purposes of deciding this case.”

Justice Kagan, joined by Sotomayor and Breyer, dissented:

>Today, the Court strips individuals of the ability to seek a remedy for violations of the right recognized in Miranda. The majority observes that defendants may still seek “the suppression at trial of statements obtained” in violation of Miranda’s procedures. But sometimes, such a statement will not be suppressed. And sometimes, *as a result, a defendant will be wrongly convicted and spend years in prison.* He may succeed, on appeal or in habeas, in getting the conviction reversed. But then, what remedy does he have for all the harm he has suffered? The point of §1983 is to provide such redress—because a remedy “is a vital component of any scheme for vindicating cherished constitutional guarantees.” *The majority here, as elsewhere, injures the right by denying the remedy.* [emphasis mine]

###North Carolina legislature

In 2018, North Carolina legislators passed Senate Bill 824, which required voters to present photo ID in order to vote. The Democratic governor vetoed the bill and the legislature overrode the veto, enacting the bill into law. The NAACP filed a lawsuit seeking to have the statute thrown out, maintaining that it discriminated against and disenfranchised a significant portion of African American and Latino voters.

As is required, the Democratic attorney general, Josh Stein, defended the law in court. The Republican leaders of the state Senate and House, however, sought to intervene, not trusting the attorney general to adequately defend the Republican-created law.

The Supreme Court [sided](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-248_4fc5.pdf) 8-1 with North Carolina's legislative leaders, allowing them to also represent the state against the NAACP.

Justice Sotomayor was the lone dissenter, writing that “the Court errs by implying that the attorney general’s defense of the constitutionality of the voting law at issue here fell below a minimal standard of adequacy.” Crucially, allowing the Republican-controlled legislature to defend the voter ID law ensures that the attorney general will not settle the case without their approval.

###Death penalty

Michael Nance was connected and sentenced to death for a 1993 murder in Georgia. Nance filed a civil rights suit against the state seeking to challenge Georgia’s only method of execution, lethal injection. Instead, he sought to be killed by firing squad, believing it “would significantly reduce the risk of severe pain.” The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Nance must bring a habeas petition, not a civil rights lawsuit, because preventing Georgia from executing Nance by lethal injection would mean that he could not be executed at all (since the state only approved of lethal injection).

The Supreme Court [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-439_bp7c.pdf) 5-4 in favor of Nance, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, Breyer, and Kavanaugh in the majority. The appellate court’s ruling, Kagan writes, would doom inmates’ petitions to fail, cutting off any chance of relief from the courts:

>The approach of the Court of Appeals raises one last problem: It threatens to undo the commitment this Court made in Bucklew. The Court there told prisoners they could identify an alternative method not “presently authorized” by the executing State’s law. But under the approach of the Court of Appeals, a prisoner who presents an out-of-state alternative is relegated to habeas—and once there, he will almost inevitably collide with the second-or-successive bar. That result, precluding claims like Nance’s, would turn Bucklew into a sham.

We need to stop bickering over gun regulation and think of other solutions.,"If the U.S could do an about face tomorrow and basically ban guns like other countries and round up existing guns would that solve our mass shooting problem?

It's not a full solution, but I sincerely think it will help.  Have two education programs nationwide in our public schools.  Maybe have these two subjects be taught more than once.  Like teach it when they are young maybe 2nd or third grade.  And then teach them it again with more material when they hit puberty.  Maybe around 9th grade or so.\n\nThe two subjects would be: \n\n(1). Coping skills, and basic ways of handling and dealing with the world, as well as exploring solutions to common problems many people face.  After all if people can cope better, and know what solutions are available, then perhaps people would be more resilient from breaking down and stealing a gun to shoot others.\n\n(2). The second course is about creating and maintaining healthy families and stable parents.  That's the goal and it would help society so much if it worked.  But the class subject would be about relationship education.  Teach kids what is ok and not ok.  Healthy versus abusive.  As well as understanding common issues, red flags, and in general what solutions often work in those situations.  The goal here would be to help outlr next generation create a stable household for the following generation to start life into.  And let's face it, the best resource for any kid is a stable household and parents that look out for you, protect you, and pull you out of the really dangerous life decisions we can and do make in our lives.  \n\nThis second subject would address so much more than just gun violence, but it would help minorities and communities as a whole.

Mass shootings were extremely rare. \n\nThe issue is not the possession of ""military grade"" or automatic/semiautomatic rifles or even the ease of purchase. It\'s exclusively an issue with American society. For over 100 years civilians could own modern military rifles. Firearm ownership rates are lower now than they were historically. This phenomenon is recent and happened generations after the items were first legal.\n\nThe only immediate solution is harm reduction.

As a society, we have popularized single-parent households, have a degenerate culture and social media has divided us more than ever.  But the root cause that started our decline was the youth movement of the 60s.  In all previous generations, the young aspired to be old due to gaining rights thru responsibility.  The 60's changed this as the old aspired to be young. People stopped respecting experience and wisdom and started respecting youth and vitality.  The shift from plan for the future went to a live-for-today attitude.  A decade later women in droves entered the workforce. This led to more money being in circulation and dual-income houses which led to having both parents having to work due to inflation. This led to kids not being raised properly. Kids were placed in front of a TV with no supervision to absorb whatever was on.  As technology advanced the TV was replaced by the computer. The internet while a great invention is an unfiltered source of knowledge. This combined without adult supervision can be changing to a child.  The big things on the net are porn, predators, and white supremacist. Combine this with huge segments of children out there who have no real interaction with their parents is it any wonder why they act like little hellions? Social media has catered to any and all perversions as these now adults are seeking attention and validation from the world. The easiest way for someone to become famous overnight is to become a meme of some kind. This either requires you to do something of greatness or to do something so stupid that it lives forever.

I’m actually pretty talented. Hundreds of thousands of rounds under a variety of circumstances will do that. I shoot A LOT. I’m also an educator. The mindset of carrying a firearm and working as an educator are so hopelessly far apart that I don’t think I could do either adequately at the same time. \n\nCarrying a firearm requires you to constantly be on guard, with full situational awareness. It doesn’t lend itself to sitting there administering an assessment, de-escalating a student, or trying to participate in a meeting. \n\nAnd that’s me. I know how to carry a pistol. I train at least three times per week with people who know even more than I do. So what happens when you get someone who was a pog in the army?

What if we got hit during passing time? Lunch time? Anytime where the halls are filled with… children? I can put quick rounds on steel at a hundred yards with my pistol (that’s not easy… btw). But there aren’t children between me and the target. My friends aren’t standing frozen, running in terror, or already bleeding on the ground as I run my training courses. The rounds that I miss, don’t end up in anyone. But that’s what the situation would be. And I don’t care how many rounds I’ve sent down range. I’m not prepared for that reality. And I never will be.\n\nWhich brings me to my final concern. I’m not a soldier. Neither are the 90 some percent of my female coworkers I’m not trying to be sexist.

CMV: Gun regulations are mostly pointless,"The gun debate is a non-issue.  
The UK passed a series of increasingly stringent gun laws, with the most significant being passed in the 1980s. Despite guns effectively being banned, homicides continued to increase throughout the 80's and 90's, until finally decreasing 16 years after guns were banned.  
In Australia, after the Port Arthur massacre, guns were effectively banned. While it is true there was a modest and gradual decline in homicides, the decline was inline with trend rates and didn't seem to accelerate. Like the UK, Australia saw an increase in homicides throughout the 80s and 90s, before peaking and declining. Over the last decade, the private gun ownership rate in Australia has increased significantly, returning to about 70% of the rate of the rate before Port Arthur. Despite this significant increase in private gun ownership rate, there was no correlative increase in homicides outside of trend rates.  
Meanwhile, the largest decrease in homicides out of any advanced economy has been in America. Like the UK and Australia, America saw a rapid increase in homicides during the 80s and 90s. Despite an increasing rate of private gun ownership, the per capita homicide rates declined drastically during the 00's and into the late 2010s. In fact, America's homicide rate in the late 2010s dropped below the UKs homicide rate in the 90s.   
All 3 of these countries have since seen increases in homicide rates.  
What this demonstrates is that gun laws seem to have very little, if any, impact on actual homicide rates. Since the purpose of gun bans supposed to be curtailing homicides, I see no evidence that support gun bans. Owning a gun will increase you risk of suicide, accidental deaths, etc., but this is true for swimming pools; swimming pools are, statistically, more dangerous to own than guns. I think owning a gun is stupid, but things aren't banned because they are stupid.  
Since this is a non-issue, I believe we should default to liberty. ",17b5zrw,0,240,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17b5zrw/cmv_gun_regulations_are_mostly_pointless/,"["">In fact, America's homicide rate in the late 2010s dropped below the UKs homicide rate in the 90s.\n\nThis is such specious reasoning. \n\nDo you know what was going on in the UK in the 90s? The Troubles. It was an on-going conflict in Northern Ireland that featured regular bombings and shootings of soldiers, police and civilians. The homicide rate in the UK peaked in 2002 and then halved in 10 years. Why? Because the IRA and Loyalist groups began disarming in 2003 and their weapons were destroyed. \n\nThe fact that America's homicide rate is at the level of the UK during an active conflict doesn't support this view, it proves the opposite. The homicide rate in the 90s was at an intolerable level for the British people, so they made changes that included gun regulation that drastically reduced the homicide rate.

But you yourself have not provided anything but correlation. And yours is clearly just an eyeball of some stats where you chose what you wanted to see. At least all of the studies here are conducted under some set of standards and threat of peer review', 'Since Australia began adopting gun restriction laws after the Port Arthur Massacre, the murder rate has dropped to [40% of what it was](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/AUS/australia/murder-homicide-rate). Over the same period, in the US the rate dropped, but then rose again to be [120% of what it was](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/murder-homicide-rate).\n\nAlso, the laws in Australia are not just an outright ban, but rather it only allows certain categories of firearms to just those people who genuinely need it. There are also strict rules on storing, transporting, and using them. That is why despite having higher levels of gun ownership, the murder rate is still down. This is an indication that the gun laws do work.', ""My arguement here is simple. \n\nThe vast majority of British police are not armed. \n\nWe do have armed police, but for your every day interaction with police you arent dealing with armed officers. \n\nCompare this to the US, where the police have to be armed because they may have to deal with an armed citizenry. \n\nIn 2022 US police shot and killed around 1200 people.

That sound like an effective result. \n\nThe US also saw a similar 60% drop in homicide rate, up until the assault weapons ban ended, at which point it increased by about 50%. The assault weapons ban coincided with a 25% reduction in gun deaths, as well. The sunsetting of that ban led to returning to nearly the same level. \n\nThere is no doubt that the guns laws are effective at what they intend. It’s a common argument that these laws would have no effect on crime, but the data shows a definite drop in gun deaths, and a definitive drop in homicide rate whenever they are implemented. \n\n\nWhen you start with a relatively low homicide rate, like UK and Australia, smaller changes in rate are more meaningful.

Even by suicide idrk about that but how many times has a swimming pool killed somebody. Also, guns really only have the main utility of killing.

And how many of those times do guns actually help people? (Not police officers or people in the military but actual citizens)', 'In order of that which I think that someone who would post this would find most persuasive, although, my personal favorite is the 3rd.   \n\n\n1. The fact that the homicide rate is low then means we have to ask the question of what percentage of gun related deaths are we willing to tolerate based upon certain guns being banned or not. Meaning, if, for example statistic for X type of gun causes Y number of deaths, and we could ban the current supply of that type of weapon to decrease the future pool of that type of gun forever (or even specific model or type of model which causes more danger). Think of if a gun has a safety flaw. Like some cheap plastic or a manufacturing defect. Such a law would be a good thing.\n2. Having bans on specific weapons or possession of guns in such cases effectively, ""reduces the cost of doing business"" for a person found in possession of such. In practice, it can empower local law enforcement to confiscate guns from people who are either legally barred from owning them, or are engaged in criminal activity.\n3. Remember here, your point is quite general. So, in something like the Japanese enforcement and adherence to cultural norms it certainly seems to be the case that strict gun laws work for them. Certainly we would say such is true for the Russians or the Chinese, or perhaps even empowering the few good people in corrupted military state or, say, one of those pseudo-democracies  with a president and all. Certainly gun laws have a point for them. THUS, (I think implied), that even in Western countries, the question is what Gun law do you wish for the state to enforce. None at all? Seems like YOUR POINT IS THE LAW SHOULD CHANGE!  \n\n4. Lets say our mere objective is to prevent tragedy, which is the point of having a gun in the first place. The bureaucratic question then is what type of tragedy do you wish to prevent. It seems to me that you want to prevent the atrocity first, and not the individual murders. For the tragedies sew the community and the entire place (especially worse in smaller towns) with pain and broken heartedness in NUMBER and strength than to the individuals who are harmed by a marginally increased murder rate. Therefore, the mass shootings have to be stopped, because mass knifings, for example, don\'t escalate beyond a few people.

We have hundreds of thousands of guns here but only via licence, because of this the gun-murder rate is about 1000x lower than the states per capita.\n\nComparing murder rates overall it’s still 4.5x lower per capita. Yes violence still happens but I think it’s obvious that if you make highly effective killing machines widely available to all and have a culture of fear and violence then the dangers are going to be greater.\n\nWe’ve had one school shooting, ever, which killed 17 and wounded 15 others (32 total - no I don’t care about the murderer) and since taking dangerous weapons away from violent and deranged people we’ve had none. I’m not aware of any rampage attacks on schools involving other weapons, it seems to be a purely gun centric issue.\n\nAmerica has had 34 killed by gun violence in school just in 2022. 276 deaths since 2000.\n\nEvery time I read another story of children in America shot in school I am so grateful that guns are essentially banned here. Never once have I sent my daughter to school and wondered if she’s safe. I can’t imagine the same is true in a country that has to have active shooter drills for kindergarteners.', 'Here are some peer reviewed sources which demonstrate you are incorrect. \n\nReducing gun ownership reduces gun deaths.\n\nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301409\n\nReducing gun deaths does not cause increases in other forms of violence.\n\n\nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305808', 'In America, the murder rate dropped bc of Roe.', ""I think you are oversimplifying it. Trying to make an argument using one statistic (gun ownership) and one trend (homicide rate) is often not going to tell the whole story. In the 80s for instance, there was an enormous amount of general social upheaval, there was a change in national wealth distribution, there was a large amount of middle class people moving from the cities to the suburbs, leaving pockets of concentrated urban poverty, there was organized crime. All of these factors influence homicide.\n\n Also, with any of the date ranges, the important question is not whether homicide went down from what it used to be. The question is whether the homicide rate is lower than it would have been had the regulation not been passed. Obviously a difficult question to answer because we don't get to see the alternate history where the regulation was not passed. But gun ownership is just one of many things that can raise homicide rate.\n\nTake this hypothetical: you have a neighborhood where gun regulation had just passed, and it's much harder to get guns. As a result 16 year old Timmy never was able to sneak a handgun out of his dad's nightstand to show off to his friends and be a wannabe gangster. 50 year old Jim with an anger problem was never able to buy the handgun that he would shoot his neighbor with in a fight over whether his fence was over the property line. 20 year old alcoholic david didn't have a gun with him when he was hammered and  learned that his girlfriend cheated on him. Situations like comprise a lot of the gun killings in America. It's not all hardened criminals who could get a gun off of the black market anyway. And in this neighborhood with regulation, those murders didn't end up happening.\n\nBut, at the same time a new addictive drug hits the streets, and organized crime moves in. Regulation doesn't affect them, they have guns anyway, and the overall murder rate in this neighborhood is higher than it used to be.\n\nBy just looking at the stats of gun ownership vs. murder, it would be easy to say that the regulation didn't help. But in reality it did work. Not perfectly, but without it Timmy would have accidentally killed his friend with the gun they were playing with. Jim would have shot his neighbor instead of a run of the mill fist fight. David would have shot his girlfriend in a regrettable moment of incoherent rage. \n\nAll of these murders would have happened on top of the organized crime murders. Even though overall murder went up after the regulation, it would have been even higher without the regulation."", "">The UK passed a series of increasingly stringent gun laws, with the most significant being passed in the 1980s. Despite guns effectively being banned, homicides continued to increase throughout the 80's and 90's, **until finally decreasing 16 years after guns were banned.**\n\nHope this clears it up for you."", 'I wonder how many school shootings those countries have.', "">Despite guns effectively being banned, homicides continued to increase throughout the 80's and 90's\n\nDid those homicides happen *with guns?*\n\nThis is a straw man to assert that gun regulations are supposed to stop all murder. They’re supposed to stop *gun* murders."", 'It\'s not only the murder rate, also suicide rate that counts about an order of magnitude higher. This has decreased in the UK and increased in the US over ~1980-now.\n\nThere is more at play than guns here, but it very likely plays a large factor in the ""success"" rate. Another is blister packs.', ""In America, gun laws have become so lax nearly anyone can have one.  As a result, anyone does and so gun violence is thru the roof.  Get cut off in traffic, shoot first, ask questions later.  A stranger standing on your porch?  Shoot first, ask questions later.  Look at someone the wrong way, get shot.  It's crazy!  Seems the county feels if we all just kill each other, all our problems will disappear.  I guess they could be right as we'd all end up dead."", 'Sine the 1990s the Uk has 3 school shootings while Australia has had 6, in the same time period the United States has had 390 school shootings.', 'Another part of gun regulation is the weaponry itself. In the Uk only people with reasons can buy guns and the guns are limited to shotguns and old rifles. Gun crime is mostly illegal handguns. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure it’s easier to kill someone with a semi automatic ar15 than it is to do with a glock or old rifle.']"

If the safety features on a gun fail, a manufacturer can be sued and held liable just like any other manufacturer of any other product. What they are immune to is lawsuits based on some absurd idea that they should be held liable if someone uses their product to commit a crime.\n\nNow, smart gun tech.\n\nGuns are amazingly reliable machines.  They stand up to incredible stresses and rarely fail.  The second you add electronics into that mix, the failure rate increases dramatically.  If a gun manufacturer introduces a wide spread smart gun tech, suddenly they are liable for failures of that tech.  If someone who wasn\'t authorized to fire is able to fire, they can be sued.

The link he gave us is to an anti-gun piece which doesn\'t belong on this sub.\n\n---\n\nIf I were to believe these results (the paper says it was an online survey panel and says that they acknowledge they have problems) that still doesn\'t mean much. The #1 question is \'would any of these laws do anything\' and the answer tends to always be \'no\'. The Bureau of Justice did an investigation after the ten-year \'assault weapon ban\' experiment ended and concluded that it had no real impact at all. Furthermore, we always see spikes for these laws after a shooting, even if the shooting had nothing to do with anything proposed. Support for banning \'large capacity magazines\' was up after the Parkland shooting, but zero large-capacity magazines were involved in the shooting.\n\nWhich brings me to my point: I firmly believe that gun control is about \'revenge porn\' on gun owners - not an actual honest attempt to increase safety. Nobody can actually make a coherent argument as to why a two ounce plastic pistol grip makes a rifle suddenly incredibly dangerous, but it\'s on every single \'assault weapon ban\' list. \n\nEven if a lot of people support a law, that doesn\'t mean it\'s a good law that should exist. Do they actually know enough about the subject matter to properly articulate their support for a law? Is there a reason to believe the law would be effective? Do the drawbacks of the law outweigh the potential benefits? Is the law constitutional and ethical?\n\nThere are a lot of measures gun owners agree with - universal background checks, for example.\n\nThe problem is the implementation. Gun owners want a Switzerland-style system where you go to the post office, get a background check certificate, and then present it to a seller (be it at a gun store or a private party). They have a verification code they can use to see if the certificate is valid and verify the name it was issued to. And that\'s it. Gun owners really want this because it would take power away from predatory gun stores who charge $35-$50 *per gun* on a background check.\n\nDems don\'t want this, but they won\'t really say why. And this is going to lead into the second half of my post:\n\n*I firmly believe that the vast majority of gun control proposed by \'non-gun owners\' (or ""anti-gunners"" as is probably more accurate to call them) are done to be malicious to gun owners, not to save lives.*\n\nWhen you look at the kind of gun laws that constantly get proposed, with almost zero reasonable explanation for them, occam\'s razor comes down to most of them being \'revenge porn\'.

That said, the NJ law requiring all handguns sold in the state to be smart guns as soon as the technology is commercially available is a good example of a political strategy to make guns more expensive and less available in the state.  Most gun owners I know who rely on a firearm for self-defense would not be willing to rely on a new biometric technology to use a firearm that they may need instantly.  I use biometrics for some safes and my phone now, and it's fine, but it routinely fails to unlock if I don't perfectly align my finger, or if my finger is wet, or if I am wearing gloves, or if there is dirt or debris or lint on the sensor, etc.  Not a big deal for my phone, but that would be a problem for a gun that I might need immediately.

"Washington state voters pass ballot measure to further regulate guns, including semi-automatic rifles",,9v0co1,26937,7629,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/gun-regulations-initiative-1639-takes-lead-in-washington-state/,"['In other news, ... Sales of 80% finished lower receivers skyrockets in Washington as its now cheaper and easier to just build a semi-automatic rifle yourself.  \n\n', ""They're FULLY semi automatic you know. - _-\n\n/s"", '""Further regulate"" is a very soft understatement. This initiative makes Washington one of the most restrictive states in the US for gun owners. Among other things, the measure:\n\n* Adds a 10-day waiting period and recent training requirement for purchase of ""assault rifles"", which is vaguely defined to include any semiautomatic rifle.\n\n* Adds ""enhanced background checks"" for purchases of ""assault rifles"" which forces the buyer to waive medical privacy, since the check allows government officials to access private medical files to determine eligibility. This enhanced check costs an additional $25 which is added to the buyer\'s existing transfer fee.\n\n* Removes the right to purchase most firearms for lawful citizens aged 18 to 20.\n\n* Makes firearms unavailable for self defense by requiring gun owners to lock up their firearms or face criminal charges.', 'This makes perfect sense. ""Assault (scary-looking)"" rifles make up about 2% of gun deaths total. Of those, maybe a handful of notable incidents would have, in any way, been affected by these changes. So we\'re targeting 1% of 2% of gun incidents. Sure sounds like blind fear to me.\n\nThat\'s akin to banning all household chemicals because some guy one time made an explosive out of them, then thinking we will be any more the safer because of it.\n\nPeople are so afraid and so desperate to do absolutely anything, they\'ve stopped considering the ramifications or even if the actions themselves make sense. Regulation shouldnt be a question of why not? (which so many here seem to think is okay). It should address a specific issue with the potential to demonstrate a measurable effect.\n\nThese gun control measures do not address recent mass shootings, they\'re simply regulation for the sake of regulation, which is the problem.\n\nEdit (now that I am at my computer with some ability to research):\n\nThe argument I keep hearing made is ""These measures were introduced to curb mass shootings"" which seems to allude to some notion that the measures directly address some of the recent shootings we\'ve seen. \\[Edit: That is the argument I\'m addressing in this post. Redditors here are making that claim and if you follow supporters of the measure, for example in the ""support"" section here: [https://ballotpedia.org/Washington\\_Initiative\\_1639,Changes\\_to\\_Gun\\_Ownership\\_and\\_Purchase\\_Requirements\\_Measure(2018)](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_Initiative_1639,Changes_to_Gun_Ownership_and_Purchase_Requirements_Measure(2018)), you\'ll see plenty of references to mass shootings and how this will help.\\] That\'s a fair point and worth looking at, so let\'s flesh that out a bit.\n\nI-1639 does a couple things (aside from its false definition of assault rifles):\n\n1. Requires Safety Training\n2. 10 day waiting Periods\n3. Raising the purchase age of rifles\n4. Safe storage\n5. Enhanced background checks\n\nLet\'s ignore 1,2, and 4 above, because never (ever) have safety training requirements, waiting periods, or safe storage requirements stopped a mass shooting. I could ask why they\'re part of I-1639 then, if they don\'t address mass shootings, but we\'ll move on.\n\nSo we\'re really interested in raising the buying age to 21 and enhanced background checks.\n\nLet\'s look at some recent high profile shootings:\n\n1. Vegas shooting (Stephen Paddock) - Over 21 and successfully passed background checks.\n2. Pulse Shooter (Omar Mateen) - Over 21 and successfully passed background checks.\n3. Virginia Tech - No rifles used here so these measures don\'t apply. Interestingly this is also the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, and all without the use of a rifle.\n4. Sutherland Springs (Devin Kelly) - Over 21 and successfully passed background checks. Failure on the part of the Air Force to register a prior DV conviction.\n5. Luby\'s Cafeteria (George Hennard) - Over 21 and successfully passed background checks.\n6. McDonald\'s (James Huberty) - Over 21 and successfully passed background checks and already owned his guns.\n7. San Bernardino (Farook and Malik) - Over 21 and successfully passed background checks. At least two of the weapons purchased legally.\n8. Sandy Hook (Adam Lanza) - Legal purchase but under 21\n9. Parkland (Nicolas Cruz) - Legal purchase but under 21\n10. Dylan Roof - Roof got his gun from his dad, which was already illegal, and was a handgun, not a rifle. Irrelevant to the measures in I-1639.\n\nSo of the recent shootings I listed above, only two even seem remotely related to the measures listed in I-1639 and that\'s the age requirement, which hardly seems like a valid point considering the rest were all over 21. It\'s almost as if age is an arbitrary factor as it relates to the potential of someone to be a mass shooter. Two (2!!) incidents involved both a rifle and an actor under 21 years old, and somehow this law being applied to everyone will stem this ""epidemic."" Two incidents are what I\'d call an outlier, not an epidemic. \\[Edit:\\] To explain my thoughts on age a little more, let\'s replace ""age"" with ""people with red hair."" Out of the ten shooters I listed above, two have red hair (because two were under 21). We make a law banning people with red hair from buying rifles, and we reason that weve done something that would have completely stopped two mass shootings. That\'s specious reasoning. First of all, people with red hair account for a small portion of the fraction of gun deaths caused by mass shooters. Theres no evidence people with red hair are more prone to carrying out mass shootings than anyone else, and in fact recent shootings show us that most mass shooters dont have red hair (and are not under 21). Still, we tell ourselves weve stopped two mass shooters. Again, that\'s conjecture. We dont know that at all. We know only that *had* the law been followed (it is often ignored) we may have at most made it more difficult for those two to use the particular weapon they used that day. I\'d argue they would just find another way to get a weapon, use a different weapon, or wait until they got their hands on the weapon they desired.\n\nBut thanks to the voters, we\'ve now passed I-1639 under the false assumption that it was ever targeted at the prevention of mass shootings. Maybe I\'m crazy or just a fool, but I do believe if you\'re going to pass laws to address mass shootings, that the law should address mass shootings. (Edit for clarification: I know some people voted for this strictly as a gun control measure, but a lot of the promotional material around it, many of the people I know who supported it, and many people in this thread, all believe the purpose was to curtail mass shootings, and that was the reason they voted for it).\n\nYou\'ve all been sold a bill of goods under the guise of taking action. The way I-1639 was promoted was as a successful fear-mongering campaign and a blatant exploitation of the victims of these crimes in order to pass unrelated gun reform. I\'m not against regulation when it makes sense, but I would be ashamed to have voted yes on this one.\n\nWhen you hear about mass shootings in the news, they are awful and terrible, but if we want to start addressing mass shootings instead of just responding out of fear, start looking at commonalities. Pay attention to the weapon used, how they got it, their age, and other factors so that we can better understand what proposed laws might actually help. Data is useful. Ask what we could have done to stop it before it started.', 'This initiative is not valid and will be overturned by the first court challenge.  \n\nIt was already subjected to court challenge and removed from the ballot for a variety of reasons (signature collection had different language than the actual bill, legally required language and formatting not followed, etc) but was placed back on the ballot by the Washington supreme court by ruling initiatives are not subject to legal challenge BEFORE and election, only after.   So the courts have already pre-nullified the bill, it just has to go through the formal process.\n\nEven without that, the Washington state constitution, [Article II section 19](https://ballotpedia.org/Article_II,_Washington_State_Constitution#Section_19) requires that bills have a ""single subject"", and this initiative not only violates that, but ignored it completely and put at least 5 distinct subjects into it.\n\nThe initiative is a disaster, legally speaking, and the result is predictable.  Court challenges will be filed (probably today), it will be overturned (all legal criteria to overturn it have been fulfilled), and the people who supported it will start blaming the NRA instead of the people who wrote a bill so flawed it could never stand.', 'I take a low dose of Prozac to help me sleep.

If you want to shoot you can but it seriously restricted.', ""I think something that is similar to but much less restrictive than Canada's.....something like:\n\n* Some set time/waiting period after initial purchase before you have the gun where the following is performed:\n* Mental Health Screening \n* Social Media Check\n* Background check, including not just convictions but family court/arrests only/civil etc, to weed out domestic violence (which is the majority of non suicide gun deaths in America).  \n\n\n\nThe issue is the government is incompetent at best, outright corrupt typically.

Both nations do not have nearly as many problem with guns as we do."", 'I’m a gun owner, I think it’s very important to allow *most* citizens to own firearms. Having a position in government or just being wealthy does not give you the right to have a monopoly on violence. When I see “ban all guns,” my brain immediately translates it to “disarm the poor and vulnerable.” Because that’s exactly what it will turn into in a non-homogenous country like the US.\n\nThat being said, I’ve known multiple gun owners who shouldn’t own guns, simply because they are either addicts/drunks with zero impulse control, or because they have no concept of firearms safety. Or honestly because they’re just hateful, racist people who constantly fantasize about violence.\n\nIMO, a good solution to this would be to require a truly extensive background check. No history of mental problems or domestic abuse, and a requirement to list multiple references all of whom must give the “OK” for the individual to own guns. After the gun is purchased, you should be required to be safety trained with it if you want to take it out of your home or have children. I like the idea of needing a license to carry in public or take a gun to a public range, considering I have been shot at on a public range and witnessed firearms injuries before. Waiting periods are also a great idea, as plenty of people buy guns impulsively to commit a violent act or suicide.\n\nOn a societal level, I think the media is mostly to blame for mass shootings. So many mass shooters these days are inspired by shit they’ve read on the internet. Look at the Buffalo murderer for instance. Also the media has caused Americans to lose all empathy for each other. “America is fascist and racist and evil” literally is propaganda that indirectly causes these sorts of things. We are a divided nation, and that hopelessness and lack of unity will always spawn evil people. Joe Biden implying that everyone who owns an “assault weapon” is an unhinged psycho is a great example of this.\n\nI’m just throwing out suggestions here. I don’t have all the answers. I just work here and am a responsible firearms owner who would never think about harming another person or animal unless they are a threat to my life or my loved ones.', 'The system you’re describing is common in many countries. The problem with comparing efficacy of such systems is there are so many cultural and other differences that it’s not analytically valid to do so. Essentially you are trying to design a research study, and if you don’t control for other variables you can’t get valid conclusions. Specifically there are geographic, ethnographic, racial, historical, income inequity differences to name just a few between the US and your typical Western Europe country. I say this not to invalidate gun control per se - just to highlight that it’s not as simple to look at comparisons as you think.', 'Personally, I feel like banning any type of gun at this point is going to bring more harm than good. There’s so many guns already in circulation and it would cause a massive uproar within the gun community. I’d say, make proper laws that require proper storage for one. That way, less firearms are stolen and used in crimes. Plus, make stricter background checks. A lot of criminals get guns through straw purchases or from stealing them from friends and family. So, in the background check, there should be a section that checks the criminal record of family members. If a family member has a criminal record that would prevent them from owning a gun, that person will get red flagged. If their gun was used by said family member in a crime, the purchaser would also face penalties. Idk if this approach would work in practice, but it’s an idea. As a gun moderate, I’m always open to hear more gun regulations ideas so I’d love to hear feedback if anyone is willing to.']"

Unfortunately, this CNN article only discusses firearm homicide *victim* rates by race, not firearm homicides committed. After several minutes on google, I had a hard time finding any information on firearm homicide rates by race, specifically. \n\nHowever, we do know racial differences in overall homicides. In 2013, [blacks accounted for 51.3% of all homicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States#cite_ref-55). The total [U.S. murder rate for 2013 was 4.5/100,000](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/murder-topic-page/murdermain_final). If you take out the black share, that would equal 2.2. On the [Wikipedia list of countries by intentional homicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), the U.S. would then fall around #138 out of 230 countries. Much better than we are for current totals (#89), but hardly ""one of the safer countries."" The 45 safest countries all have a murder rate under 1.00/100,000. This includes Iceland, Ireland, The Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Norway, etc. Germany has a rate of exactly 1.00 on this list. \n\nWhat happens if we subtract all Hispanic murders, then? Well, from the same source above, the Latino share is 12.8%. So, subtracting the black and Hispanic share (51.3 + 12.8), we get a national murder rate of 1.62. That\'s getting a lot better. It would drop us to #155 on Wikipedia\'s list, which is roughly the lower 32nd percentile, but I wouldn\'t quite say that\'s ""one of the safer countries"" in the world. That\'s just the lower safer third of all countries. We\'d still be beat out by the U.K., France, Denmark, Sweden and all the countries mentioned above. But it would be a major drop.\n\nHowever, you\'d be comparing apples to oranges, because you\'re looking at the U.S. with no Hispanic or black populations compared to the total populations of all those other countries. And yes, the U.S. has higher proportional (and total) black and Hispanic populations, but all those European countries don\'t have 0% of those groups. So if you took out their share of those populations and then re-compared these figures in a true apples-to-apples fashion, the U.S. would lag further behind Western (and most of Eastern) Europe. \n\nSo yes, a disproportionate and large share of the U.S.\'s homicide rate is coming from black and Latino communities which are found in much smaller amounts in East Asian and European countries, but these communities do not tell the whole story. The U.S. still has higher rates of homicide among the non-Hispanic white/majority population than those countries.\n\nNote: Some of the figures I showed are from different years, but generally all come from the mid 2010\'s (i.e. ~ 2013-2017). Also, this is admittedly total homicides, but I suspect demographic rates of gun violence are at least roughly similar to total violence rates, so I would expect these findings to hold reasonably accurately for gun homicides, specifically.', 'It would be better to exclude firearm homicides that are specifically gang or narcotics related, rather than based on race. While criminal gangs are disproportionately composed of minorities, there are homicides related to gang activity and narcotics trafficking not committed by minorities, and not every homicide committed by a minority is gang-related. Basing that exclusion on race would lead to some degree of inaccuracy.', '6% of the population ( African-American males)\nAge 18-35 make up over 50% of the violent crimes according to FBI statistic. \n\nDon’t down vote me I’m just telling what I’ve read.', 'Poverty and the drug war are the primary causes of gang violence, not the brownness of the participants.

The studies they reference showing a link between gun laws and gun homicides/suicides are by David Hemenway, whose studies have been debunked multiple times. More recent studies are refuting that: https://www.journalacs.org/article/S1072-7515(18)32074-X/fulltext\n\n2. The way they measure gun ownership in a state is by gun suicides, which is a terrible metric:\n\n>Gun ownership is not directly surveyed across all 50 states each year in the US. A review of over 24 gun ownership indicators found that the percentage of suicides committed with a firearm was the best measure for estimating gun ownership by state.\n\nAgain, supported by studies by Hemenway. This is pretty bad because states like California, which actually has a high rate of gun ownership, has fewer suicides than states like Washington, which has much higher suicide rates.\n\n3. They accounted for only a limited number of variables, notably missing was access to affordable healthcare.\n\n4. One good thing about the study is they used the ACTUAL accepted definition of Mass Shooting instead of the reddit-made one.\n\n5. Mass shootings are still exceedingly rare and account for a statistical anomaly within the greater realm of firearm homicides.\n\n6. The authors themselves say that they can't account for which gun laws have an effect:\n\n>To develop effective state gun laws, the underlying cause of the association with rates of mass shootings needs to be identified. Perhaps as a result of outside pressures, relatively few specific gun laws have been scientifically studied, much less proven effective, for gun violence outcomes in general, and mass shootings in particular.\n\n>Non-legislative approaches, such as environmental modifications, policing practices, and bystander training, could also be worthy of evaluation in potentially preventing and reducing the tragic impacts of mass shootings\n\nLimitations of the study:\n\n>There are several limitations to our study. Our study design incorporated a time series component, lagged variables, and multiple covariate adjustment strategies, and was primarily able to show broad associations between state gun laws, gun ownership, and mass shootings. The potential for omitted variable biases and reverse causation remain and future analyses are encouraged to build on our work by testing the before-and-after effects of enactment or repeal of gun laws in specific states, or both, alongside appropriately matched control states. In addition, the state restrictiveness-permissiveness score we used has not been validated.\n\nEdit: First of all, thanks anonymous redditor for the gold, but I'd rather you gave that as a donation to the 2nd Amendment Foundation as reddit is really terrible for both gun rights and freedom of speech."", ""Wow, it almost like there's a connection between the number of guns out there and gun deaths!

Meaning that most gun crimes happen in a very small portion of the area of the US. So comparing this on a state by state level is poor research at best and disingenuous at worst. While compounding laws means that a state will have their laws, then a county, then a city, etc.\n\nNow, what our researchers so nicely ignore is that certain cities actually do report their gun crime on a city level. The two most prominent are New Orleans and Baltimore, as random as that seems. Two cities with huge gun crime issues and we also have data on DC (gun murder capital of the US). What do these three cities have in common? Some of the most restrictive laws in the US when it comes to gun ownership and some of the highest gun related crime levels. \n\nSecond issue is that they plotted their regression curve against a magazine rating. That is almost as sacrilegious as four boys I knew that plotted the economic data of the past 50 years against the breast size of the Playboy Playmate of the month when I was in college. \n\nNot to mention studying “mass shootings” fraught with issues like what is the proper definition? How does such a small sample size skew the data? How can you reliably come to a conclusion with such a small sample size? What happens when you change the definition to 3 or 5 or 2 injured? Why are deaths chosen over casualties which would be more representative of crime than just deaths? Dying could have more to do with medical care than gun violence. And how does poverty play a role in this measurement (hint: it is everything) \n\nThe truth is that gun crime is like real estate.....it’s local. You can have a state like Maryland which is relatively benign and safe with a city like Baltimore which is incredibly dangerous. Same goes for DC and New Orleans.

A gun is a weapon for defense of the people, the nation, and the crown, not a toy to intimidate anyone who temporarily pisses you off or to vent your personal issues on innocent people. I do not understand why this is so hard to understand.']"
Gun Regulations,"There are a few goals we should have in passing new gun regulations. In my mind, the goals of this should be as follows:

* Prevent guns from getting to criminals.
* Prevent mass shootings.
* Reduce gun crime.
* Don't burden responsible gun owners.
* Prosecute straw buyers and those that sell to criminals.

As much as some people believe, I do not wish to ban all guns. Other regulations, such as age and such can be implemented, and may be an improvement in different areas, but I believe that it is only touching the edges of the problem.

To this point, I have come up with a plan to accomplish this. The following lists out the ideas for dealing with these problems. There may need to be slight changes to flush it out completely, but it is workable as is. The items support each other, so they are essentially a set.

Implement universal background checks for both weapons and ammunition. For private transactions, this should be a website, which allows for someone to enter in information and receive an immediate response on the ability to purchase a gun. This would probably require pre-running the checks or require someone to make a request to being that is multiple days/weeks long, and then following that there is only a minor update check for certain databases. The background check would include a confirmation number.

Pass red flag laws. These would be best done as state laws, as state courts can react more quickly. They should have due process protections, but that does not mean a court hearing before the weapons are seized. Studies have shown that mass shooters and some of those that commit murder act in unstable and threatening ways before committing the act. Yes, sometimes those signs are ignored, but that doesn't mean they could not have stopped the crime. Anyone flagged by a red flag law will also have their background check flagged as not allowed.

All guns that are transferred, carried outside the home, and usable, must be serialized or identified in federal records through some other method. If a gun is an antique, a way to serialize it without marking the weapon will need to be developed. Any FFL will be able to serialize a gun, but at that point it will be registered to the person that has it.

All gun transfers (gift, sale, transfer, etc.) that are not federally registered must have records kept privately of the transfer. The records should contain the gun serial number, the universal background check confirmation number, ID type, ID number, date of transaction, name of person buying, and signature of the person. The buyer should have a record containing the date of transaction, name of person selling, background check confirmation number and serial number of the gun,  Any time that a gun is transferred through a FFL, it must be registered with a federal agency. Any gun registered with a federal agency can have all private records leading up to that point destroyed.

Any person found with a non-serialized gun outside their home will be charged with a felony and the right to own guns will be revoked. The exception is that the gun can be transported inside a gun safe.

Any gun used in a violent crime that is found in possession of a person not able to pass a background check will be traced from the last federally registered transfer down through the people that owned it. If someone does not have a record of a transfer, they will be blocked from having any guns and any guns they have will be seized.

Any gun seized that is in possession of a person not able to pass a background check will be traced from the last federally registered transfer down through the people that owned it. If someone does not have a record of transfer, they will be marked as in violation. Any other discovery of this type will lead to a felony charge, blocking of all ownership of guns, and seizing of guns owned.

If a record of the transfer exists, no punishment, obviously.

Guns that are lost, must be reported before found by the police. Any that are reported after being found in a crime or the hands of a criminal will be handled as if there was no record of transfer. Multiple guns being lost will suspend your ability to pass a background check, as it shows an inability to responsibly own them.

Records can be lost, so it is recommended that copies are maintained or a service is enlisted to store a copy of the records.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, this is not burdensome to any gun owners. You can own whichever legal weapons you want. You can 3d print guns, but you would need to have them serialized. You can have antique weapons, but they must be registered. It is safest to buy them from a FFL. If you do not wish to do so, they can be bought privately, but it is important that all records are maintained. Having a gun is a big responsibility, and it should be taken seriously.

What do people think about these as possible laws? What are the holes in them? I was thinking of advocating for them, since we seem to be lost right now.

These plans will not prevent guns from going to criminals, will not prevent mass shootings, will possibly reduce gun crime but likely won’t, will greatly burden gun owners, and won’t change anything with already illegal straw purchases. \n\nUniversal background: this concept sounds great on paper, but is very hard to implement. Aside from the massive cost associated with expanding the data base, this allows independent private citizens, instead of regulated dealers, to access what is often privileged information. For example, while some things like felonies may be public records, others like cpos are not, and allowing such knowledge allows eliminating and determining. Further, the idea of pre running or a long delay, considering the allowances under the law already, won’t play out well. Finally, there is a real question on how confirmations would exist, and why the heck I need to do this to give say my son a gun. \n\nOn red flag laws, bad idea. Red flag laws are an unconstitutional limitation without a proper hearing or due process on a constitutional right. Imagine if Brandenburg only required an affidavit to stop speech. Barring a court order, you should never lose rights, end stop. Now, if you want to increase the court system following something similar to the cpo standards for this, that’s a decent possibility, but that takes some time before such is issued. \n\nOn registration this is an absolute non starter for gun owners. Much like I don’t want to be on a list more than I have to, neither do most gun owners want to be. There is no rationale for this, no way to do this effectively, and no way to produce a list non obtrusively. \n\nOn transfer documentation. How do you plan on doing this? If I transfer, I am now obligated to keep a detailed transaction record of the exact details, which is of course protected from unlawful search and seizure, and is a compelled speech not related to commerce. That’s two OTHER amendments now triggered as well. Plus, states can’t even keep their own transfer records correct sometimes, so this would be an extensive burden to expect. What happens if my house burns down, what if I’m hacked, what if I just want to sell the data? How would this achieve any purpose except to discourage transfers because of the burden imposed on a private citizen. I’m curious how you plan to track down the private records once federally registered, since I don’t think a judge could issue a warrant under such a scenario. \n\nOn the found with gun, good luck. A cop has no right to stop and inspect said gun without reasonable suspicion. So, much like Jay walking, this ends up being used in specificic, read racially biased, scenarios. \n\nOn transfer felony concept, again how will you do this? You can’t compell the records, you have no right to them, that’s a fourth amendment issue. What if it burns, you lose constitutional rights due to a house fire? \n\nOn lost guns. Let’s say I steal from your hunting cabin, you find out four months later. I use them and cops get them by then. No more guns for you ever. Even if you had them in a safe. This is absurd. \n\nPeople lose their birth documents, how can you expect people to keep multiple copies with multiple services? \n\nTo be honest, these are not good solutions, ignore the reality on the ground, and ignore the stance of gun owners generally. Many of these trigger other amendments and massive legal concerns. Those are huge burdens upon gun owners, and absolutely will fail in court. If the government can’t even legally compel sheriffs to keep records, how can they compel private citizens who aren’t operating in commerce?', 'A registration is a total deal breaker.

In fact, going over the history of commonly-agreed-upon totalitarian states, only NK and China have any gun bans in remote proximity to some sort of regime change; and that must be weighed against other much more similar countries that have gun restrictions or gun bans and have not had any totalitarian regime change, which is an \\*order\\* of magnitude more countries.\n\nGun registries will lead to a total gun ban - this is called a slippery slope fallacy.

What kind of gun regulation do you support?,"First of all, i am from Europe and i’m very interested in firearms. I go to shooting ranges whenever i have the possibility to, but it’s not often.

I think that Norway is too harsh on firearm laws, it shouldn’t be so hard. What i do like however, is that whenever someone wants to buy a firearm they have to go through a police check and a quick psychologic test. Those are the only things i see as necessary for allowing gun ownership, as that tries to weed out people who might be a little schizophrenic and perhaps could commit a gamer moment in a school.

New gun regulations considered in Vermont,,v6bjmi,45,173,https://www.wcax.com/2022/06/06/new-gun-regulations-considered/,"['[deleted]', ""Without debating the merits of any of the particular suggested further restrictions, I'll bring up a change I'm starting think we should apply to the way we look at new laws: more sunset clauses. If a new law is being proposed to curb violent crime, and it passes, there should be a 'trial period' where it is fully enacted but that it must come back to a vote after a given time period or it expires and the law reverts to what it was before. An independent, bi-partisan board should be established to review the totality of data around a topic and make an analytical report about the impact of the new law. That report would inform the vote.\n\nPersonally, I don't like the idea that we would pass any bill into law that we think even has a chance of not being right for our society. I also tend to think if something does seem like a no-brainer, we should pass it into law and move on. Of course it works! But that relies on one-sided thinking that my side is correct. I imagine many people feel that way. Perhaps that makes a trial/review period the correct way to go as a compromise? It would be nice for the two halves of our nation to get back to working together rather than each digging our heals in at the first hint of opposition to our own ideas.\n\nThe Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 is a good example here. One side will tell you that sunset clauses don't work because in the years after this law was enacted, violent crime went down, then Republicans chose to let it expire rather than extending it simply because they are bad people. In reality, The violent crime rate was dropping steadily for years before the AWB and continued to do so at the same rate after it was enacted. (IIRC, it climbed up for a couple years in the middle but no indicators that the AWB was to blame.) So the law had no beneficial impact at the cost of restricting civil rights. When the law was set to expire, the data showed there was no reason to extend it. This is where an objective, bi-partisan analysis of the impact of new laws could help. Rather than dishonest folks manipulating data (don't get me wrong, of course both sides do this!), we should be open to looking back and analyzing if decisions were right or wrong, then making the correct decisions going forward. \n\nVermont, just last week, legalized hunting with suppressors (gun silencers) for the upcoming season. There is a sunset clause there with the expectation that if there is an uptick in poaching this year, the law will not be renewed. VT was one of only two states in the country that allowed possession of suppressors but outlawed their use when hunting. The data from other states suggest that the new law will not increase poaching so I personally feel that the sunset clause is unnecessary, BUT I can recognize that it is a compromise which may lead to better policy long term, and in a way that each side of the discussion can be more comfortable with."", '*“We have criminalized things like radar detectors because they give people an unfair advantage over the police and they impact public safety. I don’t know why we wouldn’t do the same thing with body armor,”*\n\nNeither of these thing give ""an unfair advantage"" to the people, that\'s just sensational and disingenious phrasing. Radar detectors in private passenger vehicles are legal, It\'s only commercial vehicles over 10,000 lbs that are prohibited to use them.\n\nAs a constituent who is affected by the legislation passed by this body I expect the language that explains or proposes it to be as accurate and clear as ^hopefully the legislation itself. Misrepersentation, manipulation, and subterfuge in the debate only adds fuel to those who will/would oppose the proposed laws.\n\nMany oppositions will pick out one small discrepancy and use it to push their agenda. *""They lied about this ^tiny point, what else are they lying about!""* is a common way to discredit opposition. Clariity is key.\n\nEnd of rant.', 'I am in favor of raising the firearm purchase age to 21. That will largely solve the “access” angle for which everyone is looking to solve.

Here\'s a set of laws I would like to see;\n\n* National and state-by-state reform on investigations on lying on ATF Form 4473. Denials by the NICS are woefully underinvestigated, and, although the penalties are harsh for lying, almost no one is caught. The ATF investigated 12,700 cases of NICS denials in 2017 and only carried out 12 prosecutions.\n\n* National ""Shall-Issue"" firearms-purchase license which is made available through your local PD and Sherrif and is good for 10 years. It has to be ""Shall-Issue"", because otherwise, that allows a very small amount of people the power to deny people their rights based on factors like race, sex, orientation, political affiliation etc. If you are a law-abiding citizen, your rights should not be infringed. Requisite is passing a free or nominal fee ($20 or less) test for safe storage and general firearms safety to also be administered by the aforementioned PD and/or Sherrif. This license has a photo ID, and is used for purchase both in-store and online. The background check for the license should be more intensive than the Form 4473 and the NICS check, looking for any/all drug offences, felonies and violent misdemeanours. You can\'t purchase a firearm without the license, and it is reported on your 4473 when you purchase so that if the system catches you in a lie it can be reported to the local PD/Sherrif\'s office for investigation. And, obviously, it serves as a double-check on the person\'s ID.\n\n* The firearms safety test wasn\'t merely a throw-away line. DUI laws didn\'t really help drop DUI rates in the U.S.; active education and messaging helped more. Teaching people the appropriate ways to handle and store firearms (and perhaps giving a free trigger lock with the firearm-purchase license) could go a long way towards reducing firearm accidents. \n\n* Extend health insurance to cover mental health care, increase funding for suicide hotlines and mental health outreach with focuses on men\'s mental health and men\'s social groups (which are the majority of suicides in the US). 2/3\'s of gun deaths in the U.S. are suicides and the overwhelming majority of those are men, so anything we can do to reduce suicidality would be good.\n\n* There should be a ""flag"" attached to your national firearms-purchase license that is checked when you purchase your *first* firearm, that requires a 72-hour hold on the firearm. Once you have waited this time period and picked up your first firearm, you do not ever have to wait again. This is simply a measure to reduce suicidality, and wait periods for firearms purchases are effectively meaningless once the person has access to at least one firearm.\n\n* Require that all gunshops have posted suicide-hotline numbers, outreach pamphlets etc. Also, require that all ammo boxes have suicide hotline numbers printed prominently on them.\n\n* Increased economic and educational outreach to impoverished areas. Crime rates in the U.S. are highly correlated with low-income, low-education areas with high single-motherhood rates, with the primary victims being young black men. Black men specifically makeup half of the homicide victims in the U.S., and have a murder rate that is about 6 times the national average.

You may not agree with that phrase, and feel free to vent in the comment section, but let’s face the facts: we’re not getting anything done about gun violence anyway. Maybe, though, we can roll with something even gun folks can get behind. It involves lots of fun time at the shooting range, and you get a neat souvenir at the end. If guns don’t kill people, but people kill people, then we should require the people with the guns to have training on what a gun is.\n\nWe can get this out of the way right up front. I’m not some peacenik hippie. I’m a gun owner. I live in rural Appalachia. If America is ever invaded, this is where you want to be. We’re more heavily armed than the Taliban. It’s a lot like Oakland in a way: you regularly hear shots in the distance and nobody except the outsiders are remotely alarmed. Even out here, before I went hunting as a kid, I was required by law to take a hunter safety course and demonstrate a minimum level of proficiency in safely operating the weapon. Let that sink in for a spell. Before we’ll let you go off in the middle of an uninhabited zillion-acre forest on the side of a mountain somewhere, we need to make sure you know what you’re doing.\n\nUntil recently in my state of Kentucky, if you wanted to carry a concealed deadly weapon (CCW or CCDW), you had to take a training course to (say it with me now) demonstrate a minimum level of proficiency in safely operating the weapon. I took it. So did my wife. Even more, my dad is a licensed instructor. Kentucky changed that law in 2019 so that everyone can carry statewide, and the people who were most opposed weren’t Subaru-driving hipsters with three-paragraph Starbucks orders; it was the police.\n\nPart of the reason may be that the police know how firearms work, and don’t relish having to clean up the messes created by those who don’t. Pro tip: if you’re shooting from the hip like Indiana Jones or holding your gun tilted above your head like a gangster, then you’re doing it wrong, unless you’re an expert marksman doing it on purpose. People who are familiar with firearms know that it’s not Call of Duty. If you can’t answer the question of how you breathe when you shoot, then you’re wrong. If you can’t answer in detail what was behind your target when you pulled the trigger, then you’re very wrong.\n\nIn the military there is an important saying: get off my fucking range. This is tactically employed when someone — who, remember, already has extensive training — is being so careless that they have to be put in time-out like a small child. That’s because having extensive training is still no guarantee that you won’t behave like an idiot, but having no training whatsoever increases your odds.  \n\nThe proposal here is fairly simple. Make the CCW course the minimum standard to buy a gun. If it sweetens the deal, I’m willing to throw the NRA a bone and use their own standards. You get the basics of the law, you demonstrate that you can disassemble the weapon and operate it in a controlled environment within a reasonable level of awareness and safety, then you can get a gun.\n\nYou ain’t John Wick, and your fantasies of shooting someone else’s gun out of their hands or doing a backflip while you reload are just that. That isn’t the expectation. The standard we need is that, at a bare minimum, with all the time in the world, calm and collected, you can shoot at a stationary piece of paper, hit it, and not shoot yourself or someone else. If you can’t, then put the gun down, and go buy some mace if you’re worried about self-defense, because in a situation where your blood is up and your hands are shaking, you’re just as likely to shoot yourself or some bystander as you are to shoot the bad guy.\n\nIf you pass the course and pass a background check, you get a license, just like we currently issue CCW licenses in many states. If it becomes clear later in life that you are unsafe to have a firearm, you have your license revoked. If you give someone a firearm, the onus is on you to verify that they are properly licensed, just like if you hand a 14-year-old the keys to your car. If you want to buy a gun, you show your license. If you don’t have one, or you forgot it at home, then go get it.\n\nThis isn’t purely hypothetical. Maryland did this in 2013, and when the part of the regulations requiring that applicants demonstrate a reason for having a gun was struck down in court, who do you think was most disappointed? In case you’re suspecting a pattern here, the Baltimore Police Commissioner issued a statement saying quite pointedly, “This decision makes it harder for us to do our jobs.” He’s right. When Connecticut enacted their licensing standards, they saw homicides and suicides drop by around a third. When Missouri repealed theirs, they saw homicides jump by almost half, and suicides by almost a quarter. \n\n“Shall not be infringed!” comes the cry from the balcony. Shut the fuck up. You can’t buy a grenade launcher. You generally can’t be in legal possession of a firearm if you’ve been in a whole range of trouble. Private businesses and public buildings can forbid firearms. “Shall not be infringed” is a slogan — not an argument connected to reality. Slogans make bad public policy. This is a debate about degrees. Go protest about your right to carry a pistol into the courthouse, or own anti-tank weapons, and I’ll start to believe your sincerity and conviction. And I mean in the streets, not on Facebook. We already limit the right to bear arms. It’s not a question of whether to regulate guns in order to ensure public safety, but how much they should be regulated.      \n\nWe’ve had more mass shootings than days in 2023. The sickening convenience of US gun violence as a writing subject is that even if it’s not in the headlines when you begin writing, it will be by the time you publish, as we see from the latest school massacre in Nashville. Firearms are the leading cause of death for children in the US. Having a firearm means that the most likely person to get shot is your partner or yourself. Clearly, we’re doing something wrong, because I’ve taken the classes, and I’ve taught a few, and I’m pretty sure Rule Number One is don’t shoot kids, your spouse, or yourself. Clearly, we’re doing something wrong.\n\nI know we all have our ideals. They’re nice. They’re important. They’re a Magnetic North that our compass can point to. But at the same time, the compass only points one direction. It doesn’t guide you around the mountain or find the ford in the river. It tells you where you want to end up, and not how to get there. Navigating the ethical terrain of real life requires nuance — and yes, compromise. I live in a state where there are more barrels of bourbon than there are people. In the US, we have more guns than people. Way fucking more. That’s a touch out of proportion. \n\nWhen my daughter was born, my wife said I was in “Army mode.” I was. I knew all the fire escapes, and which one was closest. Stairs to the left, up to the NICU, back to get Mom. Wheelchair at the nurse station. Carry it down three floors. Wheel us out. I was mentally prepared for The Walking Dead. I really don’t want to think like that when I send kiddo to school. As a gun owner, as a service member, for goodness’ sake, this can’t be the best we can do.\n\nLet’s get honest and uncomfortable for a moment. I went through a bad patch once many years ago. I took every gun I had and gave them to my dad. I told him I didn’t want to talk about it. Take them and keep them for a while. He knew what it meant. I know he knew what it meant. Look after yours. You know what I mean. They’re yours. Blood. Creed. Clan. Caste. Next-door neighbor. Coworker. Friend. \n\nThat’s a heavy admission to drop here, and I’m half scared to say it in public. It makes my heart drop into my asshole. My wife told me not to publish it. But we need our own “Me Too.” If you happen to be in the military, we’re about four times better at killing ourselves than the people who are supposed to be trying to kill us. Something like 30,000 service members have eaten the wrong end of a boom stick since the 9/11 attacks. That’s almost one Vietnam War. Where’s their memorial? Where are their names etched into stone, where a child runs their fingers across the letters that symbolize someone they would have loved if they had the chance? Their memorial is indifference, inaction, and indignant intransigence. \n\nIf you are a gun owner, you should have the loudest voice on gun control, because you should know the stakes here — and it isn’t just public shootings that make the nightly news. It’s a lot of people who don’t respect the weapon and don’t respect themselves, because too often the only thing it takes to buy a weapon is a checkbook and a pulse, and that’s completely batshit.\n\nI sit on my front porch, because that’s where I can be alone with my thoughts. I’m watching the morning sun melt away the Appalachian spring frost, and the songbirds wage a turf war over who gets priority at the feeder. The woodpecker always wins — he’s twice as big as all the others. In my hand I hold a Smith & Wesson revolver. It’s stubby and sturdy. If a pistol had sex with a pug and a rottweiler, this would be their baby. Completely unrelated to writing this piece, a friend came over and told me to keep it for a while. She knows what that means. She knows I know what that means.', ""[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released updated official mortality data that showed 45,222 firearm-related deaths in the United States in 2020 — a new peak.1 Although previous analyses have shown increases in firearm-related mortality in recent years (2015 to 2019), as compared with the relatively stable rates from earlier years (1999 to 2014),2,3 these new data show a sharp 13.5% increase in the crude rate of firearm-related death from 2019 to 2020.1 This change was driven largely by firearm homicides, which saw a 33.4% increase in the crude rate from 2019 to 2020, whereas the crude rate of firearm suicides increased by 1.1%.1 Given that firearm homicides disproportionately affect younger people in the United States,3 these data call for an update to the findings of Cunningham et al. regarding the leading causes of death among U.S. children and adolescents.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2201761)\n\nThe previous analysis, which examined data through 2016, showed that firearm-related injuries were second only to motor vehicle crashes (both traffic-related and nontraffic-related) as the leading cause of death among children and adolescents, defined as persons 1 to 19 years of age.4 Since 2016, that gap has narrowed, and in 2020, firearm-related injuries became the leading cause of death in that age group (Figure 1). From 2019 to 2020, the relative increase in the rate of firearm-related deaths of all types (suicide, homicide, unintentional, and undetermined) among children and adolescents was 29.5% — more than twice as high as the relative increase in the general population. The increase was seen across most demographic characteristics and types of firearm-related death (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).\n\nIn addition, drug overdose and poisoning increased by 83.6% from 2019 to 2020 among children and adolescents, becoming the third leading cause of death in that age group. This change is largely explained by the 110.6% increase in unintentional poisonings from 2019 to 2020. The rates for other leading causes of death have remained relatively stable since the previous analysis, which suggests that changes in mortality trends among children and adolescents during the early Covid-19 pandemic were specific to firearm-related injuries and drug poisoning; Covid-19 itself resulted in 0.2 deaths per 100,000 children and adolescents in 2020.1\n\nAlthough the new data are consistent with other evidence that firearm violence has increased during the Covid-19 pandemic,5 the reasons for the increase are unclear, and it cannot be assumed that firearm-related mortality will later revert to prepandemic levels. Regardless, the increasing firearm-related mortality reflects a longer-term trend and shows that we continue to fail to protect our youth from a preventable cause of death. Generational investments are being made in the prevention of firearm violence, including new funding opportunities from the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, and funding for the prevention of community violence has been proposed in federal infrastructure legislation. This funding momentum must be maintained.\n-----\n\nAnyone who tries to say that any changes in regulations, training, or background checks wouldn't have a meaningful impact is ignorant of the data."", 'Sure require a license for the practice of all constitutionally protected rights while you are at it.

It\'s not even a rounding error.\n\nWhat is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:\n\n• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can\'t be prevented by gun laws (3)\n\n• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)\n\n• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)\n\nSo no, ""gun violence"" isn\'t 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.\n\nStill too many?

In just 4 cities.\n\nThis leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others\n\nYes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let\'s think for a minute...\n\nBut what about other deaths each year?\n\n70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)\n\n49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)\n\n37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)\n\nNow it gets interesting:\n\n250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)\n\nYou are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!\n\n610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)\n\nEven a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).\n\nA 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.\n\nSimple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!\n\nWe don\'t have a gun problem...

AFAIK, there has not been much change to the gun laws up here since the long gun registry was scrapped. So no bans that took effect recently to skew the numbers. We do have fairly strict gun laws, however, particularly when it comes to hand guns.\n\nToronto is the highest population city, and so also has the highest crime rate, and also gun deaths. Population of Toronto is about 2.6 million.\n\nI looked at a list of US cities by population. Closest in population is actually Chicago at 2.7 million, but I do not want to go there as everyone knows how bad the situation there and do not want to be accused of trying to weight the comparison in my favor. So I will go the other way. Houston is the next closest, at 2.1 million.\n\nFor some reason while I can find a breakdown for Toronto, I can not seem to find one for Houston. If anyone can provide the breakdown, please do. Meanwhile, I will move forward with the overall Homicide rate, and provide the breakdown for Toronto, and update with Houston if/when I get it.\n\nSo, Houston had a total of 302 homicides in 2016, holding virtually steady compared to the year before. http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/houston-murder-rate-hold-steady-acevedo-chief-10838363.php\n\nMeanwhile, Toronto had a total of 74, of which 41 were guns, 9 were stabbing, and 24 ""other"". That is a substantial rise from 2015, which had 57 homicides, 26 of them shootings. Toronto also had a total of 407 shootings total in 2016, with 288 in 2015. https://www.torontopolice.on.ca/statistics/ytd_stats.php\n\n2016 was the worst year when it came to homicides and gun violence since 2005 when we had similar numbers and it was called ""Summer of the Gun"" locally.\n\nSo to recap. With the caveat that we do not know how many of the murders in 2016 were gun related in Houston, with 77% of the population, Houston had a murder count just over 4 times as high, on a bad year for Toronto.\nAnd while they are probably included with the overall shooting stats, these numbers do not count negligent discharges, of which I think there are a lot less of since there are fewer guns around. Although even there, there was a story a few weeks back that pointed out that there is a child injured almost every day in Ontario. So there is still work to do there. http://www.torontosun.com/2017/03/27/firearms-injure-child-or-youth-almost-daily-in-ontario\n\nI think that the availability of guns have a distinct role to play in the number of deaths.', 'This just in: water is wet.', ""Sorry, but she's wrong here - or, at least, a lot is being left out.

No thanks. \n\n\nI don't say any of that lightly, or in vein of the horrible things people do with guns, but I just dont see any reasonable method to legislate gun specific laws that retain law abiding owners' rights, while also removing guns from potential criminals' hands. I think gun legislation is shortsighted.

Charge Against Hunter Biden Shows The GOP Supports Gun Regulations,"Windsor is correct. Look at all the GOP criminals that keep their guns and have done way worse than Hunter.

One of the violent pedos who tried to kill a member of the military and eventually also journalist in Elise Stefanik's and Mark Walczyk's district they protect owns a giant armory and smuggles weapons into and out of northern NY with the help of arms dealers in other states like PA and OH. They use local arms dealers when needed to fudge paperwork and distribute to other people. All outside of proper channels. 

These dealers drive right into NY with the weapons personally delivering them to this criminal and his friends at the pedos home.

We have to change how we see guns in our culture. You look at countries like Switzerland where they have a gun culture too. Everyone is familiar with guns and rifles. Everyday, regular people go practice shooting. \n\nThe difference is how they see their guns and rifles. Here in the US, guns and rifles are seen as a status symbol and a statement of power. People posing with their gun collection like you would with your trophies or jewelry. Sticking your gun in the back your waistband or carrying it around your shoulder like a purse in open carry states just to intimidate people. You feel that powerful doing that. \n\nI don\'t see that same schtick happening in Switzerland. There, guns and rifles are seen as tools and weapons. There isn\'t a status symbolism tied to it. There isn\'t a power fetish tied to it. It\'s just a gun. Or a rifle. It would be like how we see bows and arrows in this country. We seem them as weapons. Yeah, some people use them to hunt. Some people do them for sport. But you don\'t see anyone posing with their bow collection like you would with a gun collection. ""Being Hawkeye,"" isn\'t some status slang. No one is running around with a solid gold, diamond encrusted bow and arrow. No one is writing songs about them flashing their bow and arrow to their boys in the neighborhood.\n\nWe just don\'t do that in this country. But we do that with guns and rifles. And you can do all the regulations you want but until we address and change the gun culture in this country, nothing is going to change.

But guess what, red states could feel FREE knowing that they get to own their guns and if it’s about anything OTHER THAN THAT then perhaps they should be honest and acknowledge that.

Thoughts on Gun Regulation?,"I'm pro 2A, but was curious about how everyone here felt about increasing restrictions on gun purchases.

I believe that allowing your citizens to be armed makes for an overall safer and better society with regards to outdoors sporting, a check on totalitarian government, and self-defense. I also believe that there is clearly an issue in our country with public mass shootings. One possible way to help with this problem is to make guns harder to acquire through regulation. Keeping guns out of the hands of people with a higher likelihood of committing gun violence seems like the most rational way to go about this.

There’s already a huge disparity in the words constituting the 2nd Amendment versus how it is applied in practice (especially depending on the state you live in). How many restrictions and qualifications can you place on a right until it is no longer truly a right? \n\nAccording to the US Supreme Court it is unconstitutional to :\n\n-Require a precondition on the exercising of a right. (Guinn v US 1915, Lane v Wilson 1939)\n\n-Require a license (government permission) to exercise a right. (Murdock v PA 1943, Lowell v City of Griffin 1939, Freedman v MD 1965, Near v MN 1931, Miranda v AZ 1966)\n\n-Delay the exercising of a right. (Org. for a Better Austin v Keefe 1971)\n\n-Charge a fee for the exercising of a right. (Harper v Virginia Board of Elections 1966)\n\n-Register (record in a government database) the exercising of a\xa0right. (Thomas v Collins 1945, Lamont v Postmaster General 1965, Haynes v US 1968)\n\n. . . and yet we see all these applied to gun ownership.\n\nHere is the thing, it really comes down to the “shall not be infringed”, NO OTHER RIGHT IS EXPENSED IN SUCH ABSOLUTE TERMS.\n\nIt helps to understand if you consider that gun control isn’t really about controlling guns--it’s about controlling people. Licenses are just a way to control people and the actions they make. Unfortunately, licenses/registration assumes that every gun owner is a potential criminal and treats them accordingly. That’s really at cross purposes to what a civil liberty is supposed to be about.\n\n*I do belive the Court\'s ruling in Nunn v. Georgia in 1846 is close enough for the intent of the founding fathers.*\n\n>Nor is the right involved in this discussion less comprehensive or valuable: ""The right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed."" The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, reestablished by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!\n\nWeapons secure all of our rights. Taken from our [Declaration of Independence](http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/) ""Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.” how we do that, is with our arms.\n\nAnything an average soldier has access to the citizens are supposed to. That\'s what the militia mentioned in the 2nd is about.\n\n""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""\xa0\n\n""A well regulated Militia"" [""well-regulated""](https://www.constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm) referring to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected.[""Militia""](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246) referring to all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and under 45 years of age who are citizens of the United States who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia (the unorganized militia) and armed to adequately and appropriately carryout that duty. So the \'armed to the standard soldier\' this would by default include things like grenades.\n\n""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms"" creates an individual constitutional right for citizens of the United States. The United States Constitution restricts legislative bodies from prohibiting firearm possession, or at the very least, the Amendment renders prohibitory and restrictive regulation presumptively unconstitutional.\n\nRemoving the access for people who shouldn\'t have firearms is constitutional and quite intelligent. Banning access from law abiding citizens, absolutely not.\n\nAnd I feel that I should add... No, the removal of rights under certain circumstances (felons, mentally unstable ect.) is a seperate debate not exclusive to guns. It is not \'gun control\'.', ""You can't punish someone for PreCrime, so how do you expect to catch criminals before they break the law?"", 'Consider the background check. What they do is take the purchaser\'s name, date of birth, state of birth, citizenship, and, if they provide it, SSN, and run it against various databases seeking a match. If there\'s a possible match or a positive match, it results in the transfer being delayed or denied. If there\'s no match, the sale is approved. The system doesn\'t check against ""good people"" (I.e. people who\'ve had a background check done for employment or security purposes) to see if there\'s a hit because most people don\'t have a record in a system like that. \n\nThink about your time growing up. How many people had fake IDs? Granted, IDs have gotten a bit harder to fake with better security measures incorporated into them, but there still are decent fakes available. A fake name that doesn\'t match up with a criminal doesn\'t result in a hit during a background check.\n\nThen consider the mass shooting problem. Most mass shooters don\'t have criminal records that disqualify them from firearms purchases. There are exceptions, like the shooter in Sutherland Springs TX and the guy down in Charleston SC at the Baptist Church. Both had disqualifying records which should have prevented them from acquiring firearms, but, in one case, the military didn\'t put the disqualifying information into a database where it could be found. In the case of the Charlestown, SC shooter, they couldn\'t match up the disqualifying record with the jurisdiction to validate the arrest. Both should have been disqualified, but weren\'t.\n\nOr take the recent Va Beach VA mass shooter. Allegedly, he had a silencer, which, if it were acquired through legal channels, requires submitting fingerprints, photographs and full identifying information for a background check. There\'s no indication that he had a criminal history, so, he, too, would have passed the background checks prior to acquiring firearms. Even the Vegas asshole had a clean record up until the moment he opened fire. \n\nSo background checks aren\'t perfect, they don\'t always work, even the most stringent firearms-related background check can\'t prevent someone who hasn\'t committed a crime prior to starting shooting. So how, exactly, are enhanced background checks going to solve the problem?', '>I\'m pro 2A, but\n\nHere we go\n\n>felt about increasing restrictions on gun purchases\n\nPointless, useless, expensive, reduction of liberty for the sake of increased government control, lacking every indication of effectiveness or common sense.

The only ones who will care about regulation are law abiding citizens. Criminals will still have weapons even if they have to make them. \n\nPeople like to talk about Japan as a great example of gun regulation. However their culture is also very different. In 1995 a cult in Tokyo killed 12+ people. Despite having smuggled AK74's into the country they didn't use them in the attack. They used the nerve agent sarin they produced themselves - sarin as in the organophosphate chemical weapon. Not only is it internationally restricted, but even the precursors to make it are restricted. Case in point - mass murder will never go away. Sarin is many times more difficult to make than a firearm, or a bomb, or even just renting a truck (the 2016 Nice truck attack in france actually killed and wounded more than the 2017 vegas shooting).\n\nThe mass shootings are just the latest excuse to restrict the 2nd amendment. They make up a fraction of the violent crime every year. The availability of weapons isn't the cause of them. If you want to lower the amount of mass shootings then find the real cause. In the 60's you could mail-order an AR15 right to your front door with no background check. If you were a minor, if you didn't already have a gun your father gave you, then one was likely easily accessible in the wood and glass gun cabinet (safes weren't as popular then). It was actually easier to get your hands on a gun then, yet mass shootings were rare. Something changed between then and now, and the availability of obtaining a firearm seems irrelevant in that change since firearms are now more restricted. I'm not sure why you think more restrictions will change anything since we've been down this road before. The gun control act of 1968, the 1993 brady bill, 1994 assault weapons ban. All of those were more red tape for law abiding citizens. Yet criminals still have weapons and people still get shot. Universal background checks?

CMV: People that want to further regulate or bans guns to save lives should also be willing to further regulate or ban alcohol.,"I've noticed a logical inconsistency when people try to further regulate or ban guns. It usually starts after a mass shooting of some kind and I hear many people passionately insist that the loss of life is unacceptable and that we need to do something to protect innocent people. I agree that we could take some steps to help make it less likely that crazy people will hurt innocent people but why would people resist the same sort of logic when it comes to alcohol? Alcohol hurts FAR more people in the US than guns do. The NIAAA has lots of troubling statistics on the risks and effects of alcohol. [NIAAA](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics) 

It seems to me the inconsistency is the result of tribal politics. Not logical or nuanced thinking. Most of us have already heard many of the arguments that propose we further regulate or ban guns and it seems to me that many of the same arguments could be made about alcohol. I'm sure some of these statements will sound somewhat familiar...

* What, are you an alcohol nut? Cant let go of the bottle?
* Why don’t you care about all the dead kids in the streets?
* Our corrupt politicians are bought and paid for so that the powerful alcohol lobbyists can keep making more and more money!
* Saudi Arabia banned alcohol and they don’t have nearly as many alcohol related deaths as we do! Why don’t we wake up like them?
* Pro alcoholics don’t have souls! They’re evil and don’t care about saving lives!
* Why can’t we support “common sense” alcohol regulations? Why can’t we DO SOMETHING?!
* That abusive dad had a mental health issue and should never have been sold alcohol!
* You’re either with us in the fight to save lives, or you’re against us in the fight to save lives!
* Let’s sue the distillery that made the alcohol whenever somebody kills someone while under the influence!
* Why don’t we mandate breathalyzers in every vehicle?
* Why don’t we require a license for alcohol?
* Shouldn’t we require a psychiatrist to interview people that want alcohol so badly?
* Why does this country have such an alcohol fetish that allows our kids to be beaten and abused day after day?
* Why isn’t it worth trying to restrict alcohol to save lives? Aren’t the innocent children’s lives worth it?
* Why does anyone need a bottle of Everclear? Why can someone literally buy a high capacity 3,240 rack of beer from Budweiser?
* The 21rst amendment is outdated and needs to be revised!

Again, I agree that we should at least consider some new measures to stop mass shootings, but why do these arguments make sense to so many people when applied to guns but not to alcohol, or even drugs?


EDIT: Just to be clear. I don't actually support further restricting or banning alcohol. This is just to illustrate something that seems profoundly inconsistent to me. 

EDIT 2: Another clarification. (I actually doubt it, but I'll at least try...) I understand the direct comparison/analogy between regulating guns and alcohol is NOT perfect because intent IS important in both cases and I perhaps tried to tie them together too tightly when putting this together. However, part of what prompted this CMV is that everytime a tragedy takes place I've noticed that many of the anti-gun folks will undoubtedly turn to the same emotional arguments that I presented above that are designed to smear the opposing sides character instead of having a rational discussion about the right balance between risks and rewards that both guns and alcohol offer in varying degrees. Instead, the prevailing argument seems to be that unless pro-gun folks agree with the anti-gun folks then the pro-gun side must have some sort of moral deficiency and will undoubtedly have the same arguments above leveled at them in reverse. In my mind, it's still absurd to apply many of the above anti-alcohol/anti-gun ""arguments"" (many of which are logical fallacies) in one case but not the other.

EDIT 3: Many of the counter arguments hinge on the INTENDED use for both guns and alcohol. That alcohol is intended for ""fun"" or ""entertainment,"" while guns are intended to ""harm"" or ""kill."" As a general matter, I agree with the very **positive** characterization that alcohol's intended purpose is to have ""fun"" and be ""entertained"" and I really do believe that most people attempt to use it with those good intentions while still acknowledging the fact that many many lives are destroyed by it. I still accept that its primary purpose is intended for good.
What I do NOT agree with though, is that many people automatically characterize guns in a very **negative** way and insist that the only intended purposes for guns are to ""harm"" or ""kill."" The same people that will passionately insist that alcohol's intended use be characterized in an overall **positive** light (despite its VERY obvious shortcomings) will just as passionately resist any positive characterization that the primary purpose for guns is to ""protect"" and ""defend"" which I find interesting since I really do believe that the majority of people attempt to use them with good intentions, even when doing so can unfortunately end a human life. (This is the unfortunate paradox of using offensive weapons with defensive intent) The word games being played are important here because we cant have a discussion by misleading and obfuscating the truth by trying to attribute bad motives to the other side in an attempt to sneakily gain the moral high ground by pretending that the other side only wants guns for their intentions of ""harming"" or ""killing"" people.

To illustrate this point, I could try to play the same word games with alcohol's intended uses too. Alcohol isn't really just for ""entertainment"" or ""fun."" (It actually has the opposite effect on a lot of people.) Alcohol's intended use is in fact to ""alter your state of mind."" It's intended use is to, ""cloud your judgement."" Alcohol's TRUE and INTENDED use is in fact to [interfere with the brain’s communication pathways](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/alcohols-effects-body) according to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. A very **negative** characterization of alcohol would be to say that the primary purpose of alcohol is to ""'poison"" yourself and ""alter your state of mind"" in a way that risks destroying your life and further risk far more deaths than guns do in total aggregate each year. Don't you see how disingenuous those arguments are? They may be true(ish) depending on your perspective, but they miss the point entirely about the true intentions of what alcohol is primarily used for by the majority of people which is a very important factor when we're trying to have a discussion about whether or not we need more restrictions on alcohol. Many people are playing the exact same word games when it comes to guns and their true intended uses for the majority of cops, soldiers, and law abiding citizens.

None of us is perfectly consistent in our beliefs or our behavior. Consistency is for academic philosophers. In the actual, daily project of trying to be decent, inconsistency is inevitable. (1)\n\nThat said, there are some differences between guns and alcohol. One that occurs to me is the *aim* of these things. Guns exist primarily to harm things. The primary purpose of alcohol, though it is in fact harmful, is to change the way a person feels (reduce anxiety, increased sociability, and intoxication). \n\nWhen alcohol is used in ways that are likely to harm others, we *do* enact ""common sense"" regulations on its use. For example, it is illegal to drive after drinking, even for a short distance, even if you can reasonably do it safely some of the time. \n\nAnd there are, in fact, *many* public health initiatives designed to help people with problematic relationships to alcohol, aimed at reducing or eliminating their use. \n\n-----\n\n(1) **EDIT:** For everyone taking issue with my statement about calls for consistency being a bad tactic, let me paste a later post I made:\n\nConsistency is, of course, a good thing! But I get a little bit tired of the style of post on here claiming that people who believe X must believe Y. Oftentimes, this is trotted out alongside the banner of ""logic,"" but very rarely by someone making a narrow, formally logical argument. Instead, it\'s usually just a veiled way of saying that people who disagree with you are stupid.\n\nConsistency is a wonderful tool for evaluating your own beliefs or the beliefs of others, and if the OP had made a post about how he opposed gun regulation for reasons A, B, and C, and gone on to use the regulation of alcohol as a useful analogy, I think he would have had much more productive conversations.\n\nBut hypocrisy all on its own is a minor, ordinary sin.', ""Alcohol is already incredibly highly regulated in a variety of ways.\n\n- Only certain locations are legally allowed to sell it\n- You must present an ID to make a purchase\n- There are massive restrictions on what products can be legally sold in the first place\n- Public drunkeness is in many places an illegal activity\n- It is illegal to sell to children\n- Parents can be punished if their kids host a party where other children are drinking\n- Bartenders can be liable if they over-serve a patron\n- In order to make your own hard alcohol you require a license\n- People who have proven that they cannot be trusted to not drink and drive have many of their rights significantly curtailed (for example breathalyzers, mandatory AA sessions, loss of drivers license)\n- Police heavily enforce drunk driving laws\n- The federal government has stepped in to force states to adopt a common drinking age standard by threatening to pull interstate funding\n\nWhen you talk about other ideas people bring up as comparisons (cars for example are even more deadly) the list of regulations that are placed on those products and their use are massive.  The difference is that these regulations have become so accepted as a normal part of society we don't question them.  Of course you need to take a drivers test and obey the speed limit while using a car."", ""Do you have any data or sources to suggest that people who support gun control don't support measures like [higher alcohol taxes?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/27/heres-how-many-people-would-die-as-a-result-of-the-senates-tax-cut-on-booze/?utm_term=.d81f4990491f)\n\nThis seems like a red herring by attributing an inconsistency in belief to hypothetical people whom you haven't shown to exist."", ""People who want to further regulate or ban guns believe that the effort to ban or regulate them would be more successful than the ban on alcohol.  \n\nThere are a lot of things that make the two vastly different, including modern techology and the perception that it would cost less to ban weapons than alcohol.  There is also the fact that several countries have quasi-successfully banned weapons, while I don't believe any country has had much success banning alcohol. "", '\n>    What, are you an alcohol nut? Cant let go of the bottle?\n\nI have two close relatives who\'re recovering alcoholics, lots of family members have been for years asking them to stop drinking, statements like these (although more sympathetic and loving) aren\'t unfamiliar at all.\n\n>    Why don’t you care about all the dead kids in the streets?\n\nAre you implying children have been killed in mass drinking events? Because this as far as I know, it hasn\'t happened over ten times this year. \n\n>    Our corrupt politicians are bought and paid for so that the powerful alcohol lobbyists can keep making more and more money!\n\nPoliticians are lobbied by many industries and most people feel that influence is unfair and undue, I really don\'t care if it\'s Springfield Armory, Anheuser-Busch, or Halliburton, I\'m not a fan of legal bribery. When any Industry writes it\'s own regulations it rarely benefits voters. \n\n>    Saudi Arabia banned alcohol and they don’t have nearly as many alcohol related deaths as we do! Why don’t we wake up like them?\n\nAlcohol regulations are strict in the US and have been since the prohibition era, they have actually never gone back to being as unregulated at before the prohibition era, and US alcohol consumption has never reached the same level as it was before prohibition. \n\n>    Pro alcoholics don’t have souls! They’re evil and don’t care about saving lives!\n\nI\'d like to point out at this juncture that in the gun debate you have people who are saying ""why don\'t we have laws that keep guns out of felons and the mentally ill\'s hands"" and then you have people saying ""your saying ""why don\'t we ban all guns, and put all gun owners in PRISON"""" no that\'s not what were saying, that\'s some absurd ass straw manning. \n\n>    Why can’t we support “common sense” alcohol regulations? Why can’t we DO SOMETHING?!\n\nAlcohol is very heavily regulated, you can\'t brew it, ship it, sell it, or consume it outside of these regulations with out getting into a lot of legal trouble, including prison sentences, fines, and losing your license to drive, run a business, or sell alcohol. \n\n>    That abusive dad had a mental health issue and should never have been sold alcohol!\n\nIt\'s illegal in many states to sell Alcohol to people who are already drunk, or impaired, or seem to be suffering some medical problem, the person selling Alcohol can actually be held liable for the crimes of a drunk person if they don\'t follow these regulations in some states. Sounds a lot more regulated than guns doesn\'t it? \n\n>    You’re either with us in the fight to save lives, or you’re against us in the fight to save lives!\n\nStraw-man argument, no one on the left is saying this about guns. \n\n>    Let’s sue the distillery that made the alcohol whenever somebody kills someone while under the influence!\n\nGun manufactures are legally protected from law suits, and legally protected from government even gathering information about the effects of wide spread gun ownership. No other industry is this protected by regulation from responsibility. Doesn\'t it objectively sound like they write the regulations themselves?  \n\nYou can sue Alcohol manufactures, you can study the effects of their product, they aren\'t legally protected from these things like gun manufactures are. somehow they still manage to turn a profit. \n\n>    Why don’t we mandate breathalyzers in every vehicle?\n\nMy BIL is currently wearing a blood alcohol monitor on his ankle to prove he\'s not drinking as part of a plea agreement. Many people are required to have a Breathalyzer on their vehicle to prevent their drunk driving due to their dependency on alcohol. \n\nThis is already happening, alcohol is heavily regulated, not so with guns.\n\n>    Why don’t we require a license for alcohol?\n\nYou have to have a license to sell it, to manufacture it, and a government issued ID to purchase it, it\'s more heavily regulated than guns, as all you have to do to buy a gun is find a private sell and there is no burden on you at all to prove you aren\'t a felon, you don\'t even need valid ID. \n\n>    Shouldn’t we require a psychiatrist to interview people that want alcohol so badly?\n\nwhen you break the law and drugs and alcohol are involved you often are required in sentencing to seek treatment, and if you fail to do so face a long prison sentence, not so with crimes involving guns, although their are sentences that require you to not own a gun, and considering the majority of gun deaths in the US are caused by felons who have illegally obtained guns, it seems there\'s a real problems with Law Enforcement not having the tools to stop these sales, perhaps new laws giving Law Enforcement more tools would be wise? The NRA is opposed to giving Law Enforcement common sense tools that surgically target felons alone and illegal gun sales alone. WHY? \n\n>    Why does this country have such an alcohol fetish that allows our kids to be beaten and abused day after day?\n\nThere are entire government agencies dedicated to reporting and stopping child abuse, also while alcohol can impair your judgement and some react violently to being drunk, if you beat your children drunk, you beat them sober. ""I was drunk"" isn\'t a defense in court, and it doesn\'t help you get out of personal responsibility. \n\nSeems like people don\'t say these things because we have laws and government agencies that work hard to make them illegal and enforceably so. Too bad it\'s illegal for the government to even study gun violence. \n\n\n>    Why isn’t it worth trying to restrict alcohol to save lives? Aren’t the innocent children’s lives worth it?\n\nAlcohol is highly regulated. why aren\'t guns? \n\n>    Why does anyone need a bottle of Everclear? Why can someone literally buy a high capacity 3,240 rack of beer from Budweiser?\n\nEverclear is a notoriously dangerous drink, and is illegal in much of the US and many other places in the world. Many people are very much against it being legal. AKs are good though, even though people have an ever higher dislike of them. makes sense right? \n\n>    The 21rst amendment is outdated and needs to be revised!\n\nIt\'s no where near as vague as the 2nd amendment, which has been reinterpreted from generally being seen as ""you have a right to a national guard"" to ""you many buy and own anti-aircraft weapons to personally own""\n\n\nMy point to you is this, the majority of the US population wants strong gun laws to prevent violence. The Gun industry effectively writes it\'s own regulations, and is vastly unregulated. No one is proposing drastic regulations about banning all guns, or demonizing all pro-gun people, at least not the actual politicians and voters organizing and protesting and writing law proposals. \n\nThis constant defense from the right that ""well if you pretend guns are watermelons then these lefties are all hypocrites"" is very ineffective. First of all, the debate is about guns and gun violence not ANYTHING else. whataboutism will not stop the debate on guns and gun violence. Secondly almost any deadly thing in the US is heavily regulated and studied and the laws surrounding them are heavily enforced. The gun laws surrounding guns and gun violence are difficult or impossible to enforce, they are far less regulated than Cars, Alcohol, Chemicals, Money, Switch-Blades, Box-Cutters, Plastics, Food, and so on. There\'s a much better question that ""why aren\'t you bitching about something else that is also a problem"" and that is ""why don\'t we actually DO something about this""\n\n\n', ""If you recall, we played around with the idea of banning alcohol already. Amended the constitution and everything. Despite the popular narrative, prohibition actually worked quite well--per capita alcohol consumption plummeted and stayed low for the next several decades. Prior to prohibition, the average American consumed 2.6 gallons of ethanol (the pure alcohol content) annually. After repeal the average was about 1.2 gallons. Those high levels weren't reached again until 1975, but they quickly dropped again and actually we're still shy of the 20th century peak even today. \n\nThe problem, of course, is we're now intimately aware of the raft of unintended consequences alcohol prohibition brings. It destroyed a good chunk of American industry, right down to forcing several transatlantic ocean liners out of service because Canada could serve alcohol on their boats and no one wants to be sober on a multi-day trip to Europe. Repeal came during the depression in large part to stimulate the economy by once again collecting tax revenue on liquor sales and try to revive the liquor and liquor-adjacent industries. Enforcement proved far too expensive. The courts were overwhelmed. People and states felt the Feds had too much power. And of course there was the crime. So much crime and corruption.\n\nSo we look back and think that downsides of prohibition are too high--let's stick with regulating alcohol and educating people. Cirrhosis rates are still far lower than they were 150 years ago. Something like 30% of Americans basically never drink. We're doing pretty well on the alcohol front. \n\nGuns...maybe not to so much. We aren't doing pretty well at avoiding gun deaths. We see all the dangers but we don't have a historical experiment to look back on and see how it worked. We see it largely working in other countries though. So maybe it's worth a try! And that's probably why people are down to ban or regulate guns more strictly, but not alcohol--we know one probably can't work the way we want, but we have reason to believe the other can."", ""I think we can both agree that alcohol and guns have a certain positive and negative effect on society as a whole. \n\nHere's a few examples on their benefits. During many occasions from weddings to  business events, alcohol is served to provide a greater sense of enjoyment and is useful in helping groups of people socialize more easily. \n\nAs for guns, they can help provide security in homes. Especially in such a huge country like the USA, where people can live far away from one another, it can be difficult to call for help and self-defence could be the only option in case of a burglary or even a bear attack. Guns also provide national security in the hands of the military.\n\nNow it's time to give some not so nice examples. Alcohol can easily make people lose their minds when consumed beyond one's limit. Decisions can be rashly made and people can do overly stupid things that can get themselves killed. Some people can be driven to abuse their loved ones, and go on a drunken stupor, drinking while driving and harming others in a car accident. \n\nNow for guns. Guns are naturally deadly. If not kept in a safe place, children can get their hands on them and accidentally harm a loved one. With overconsumption of alcohol, one may gain the courage to kill anyone easily. However, guns are more deadly when people are sober. People can plan armed robberies, heists, mass shootings, murders, kidnappings, and many types of crimes. \n\nI've said a lot already, but I haven't started on my point. The reason why I give all these examples is that I want to point out the differences between alcohol and guns as a tool for crime. For many of the crimes involving the misuse of alcohol, the trend is that people make rash/out-of-character decisions under the influence of alcohol. Addiction is also a huge problem among alcoholics. However, alone, alcohol does not usually provide any sort of instantaneous danger to society, and a drunk person is easy to spot. I know I can't dismiss drunk driving here. However, most of these people mean no harm when they are sober, and that's the point I want to drive across (not meant to be a drunk driving joke but ok).\n\nFor many of the crimes involving the misuse of guns, the impact on society is huge. Mass shootings impact all schools, not just the schools that were directly affected. The ease of access of guns commercially and on the black market allow gangs to have a huge impact on small communities. However, the most dangerous thing about having weaponry so accessible is that people who seem perfectly normal are able to unexpectedly cause a huge burst of damage and harm to a large group of people in such a small amount of time, and really easily too. Dangerous people who want to harm people can achieve their goals a lot more easily with guns, and other than heightened security, there are very few ways to deal with these problems.\n\nPersonally, I feel that the danger that alcohol poses is significantly lesser than the danger guns possess. Especially in 2018 where terrorism is increasingly rampant, guns can provide a really easy way to spark racial tension and achieve terrorists' goals. I don't see any significant way alcohol can do that.\n\nTLDR: Alcohol and Guns produce negative externalities that harm society, but the amount of danger alcohol poses is significantly less than what guns can provide, as harmful intentions can come to fruition a lot more easily with guns than with alcohol."", ""Professional brewer here. We _do_ strictly regulate alcohol. In my jurisdiction if I over serve you and then you go out and get in an accident, I'm liable."", ""One problem is that when someone choosing to drink alcohol, they're making the choice for themselves. People can't choose to not get shot."", 'It is possible to be passionate about change in one area without being passionate about change in other areas. For example, why are feminists so concerned about earning slightly less than men when women in the Middle East can be imprisoned for being raped? Why should anyone care about poverty in the United States when there are countries that are way worse than us? Why should we care about who our President is when at least we get to elect a president that doesn\'t support genocide?\n\nWhataboutism isn\'t a new thing but it seems to have caught a pretty big wave within the last year or two. With a finite amount of resources (time, money, etc), we can only try to enact change on certain things. It doesn\'t make you a bad person for protesting one injustice when there are potentially \'worse\' things that are also happening. \n\nIt\'s very possible that some of the gun control advocates are in favor of safer alcohol use. It\'s very possible that some of the gun rights advocates are also in favor. It is going to be hard to change your view when you want us to change your mind about what an unidentified, unsourced, decentralized group of ""people"" want to do.', ""This is a false equivalency argument, comparing two things as being sufficiently similar to warrant the same response (usually it's deployed to insist that guns are as innocuous as something like a car, as in that shootings are in some sense as 'accidental' as car accidents).  I see your points, and in fact the damage it does *was* a driving force behind the temperance movement and prohibition.  A lot of people who are pro-marijuana (myself included) point out alcohol's immensely more damaging and addictive qualities, and that it's not even that much fun for many people compared with pot, so really it has more downsides than upsides as a recreational drug.  \n\nHowever, despite the similarities you may draw, an equivalency argument like that necessarily discounts the differences between the things being compared, and ignores context.  You could make an argument that hammers might just as well be banned because people have often used hammers to kill other people, and there was even such a thing as a hammer designed expressly to kill other people with (a war hammer!).  As far as I'm aware, though, there haven't been dozens of hammer massacres where adults and children alike have been murdered by someone on a rampage in an innocuous public space while trying to go about their daily business.    Particularly with assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, the loss of life is much greater than it otherwise would be with a pistol or hunting rifle, although those too have been deployed in shootings.  It's about the particular technology and its killing power, what it's expressly designed for as opposed to what it might be imperfectly adapted towards, and about what's specifically happening.  Has alcohol frequently ruined lives and resulting in people abusing their families and/or hurting others?  Sure, and that's a social ill all its own.  But it's not equivalent to someone walking into a crowded theater while everyone's trying to watch Batman and opening fire, killing dozens of people.  Just because two different things can be harmful, doesn't mean they're apples to apples.  \n\nAnother point, and this is related but somewhat off-topic, is that there is a significant inertia against doing something about our problem with mass shootings that, at its source, has more to do with money than anything else.  The NRA has blocked and continues to block funding requests (through congress) for large studies by the CDC, and the studies that do exist have either been snuck in under the radar (by the NIH in the case I'm thinking of, to study the impact of guns in a vaguer way), or else it's research performed by individuals with large sums of their own money - Garen Wintemute has spent ~$2 million of his own money over the years and put himself into dangerous situations at gun shows in order to get data.  Another statistic from an article I read stated that there are less than 20 academics in the entire United States researching firearms and their impact, because it's very hard to get funding.  So, there's a large and powerful lobby that is doing everything it can to block a discussion informed by good, extensive data while simultaneously spreading their own propaganda to distract from the real argument, and *even despite that* the data that exists shows unequivocally that people who own guns are statistically more of a danger to others and themselves than would otherwise be the case.  Especially regarding odds of suicide, if you own multiple guns, don't keep them locked up, and keep them loaded in your house, there's a +820% chance that you'll use it to commit suicide.  So, the national argument against regulation isn't in good faith, because it's not focused on gathering good statistical data, heeding expert advice, and then stepping back and making a decision either for or against regulation. Instead, it's about making evasive arguments and de-emphasizing the problem.  It's basically a strategy of denial, and although I know many individuals are sincerely pro-gun and believe their arguments, they're ultimately arguments fed to them by the pro-gun lobby, whose motivation is profit.    "", ""Let's make the analogy even more specific.\n\nBeer = .38 Smith and Wesson.  \n\nWine = 12 guage shotgun\n\nWhiskey = higher caliber rifle\n\nEverclear = semi auto rifle, maybe modified to almost full auto. \n\nIf you alter this argument to JUST be about everclear and semi auto weapons the debate changes. How much of an uproar would most people have to banning everclear? Some people would be upset, but there's a bunch of people who just wouldn't care. \n\nReciprocally, the semi-auto weapon can easily kill a large number of people in a relatively short period of time, and this is its demonstrated purpose. Whether you're trying to defend yourself or not, the gun is there to create bodily damage.\n\nConversely, to get the equivalent killing power out of a bottle of everclear I would have drink said bottle and drive a full bus of people. \n\nYour argument is valid in terms of the numbers of human life, but on the extreme end where the cumulative threat to human life is at its maximum it becomes an absurd false equivalency. \n\nA better assessment of the numbers might be to look at deaths, not in total, but in percentage of users. Better yet, look at deaths of non-users attributed to the items. The logic breaks down once again. One is designed to kill and harm non-users. The other is mostly moot to the non-user. \n\n"", 'Your arguments here are extremely incomparable.  Alcohol is nothing like firearms (despite both being under the purview of the ATF, but hey).  Only *extreme* amounts of alcohol actually kill people, and we\'ve actually had a decent amount of education regarding responsible use of alcohol so that the public generally understands how to deal with it.  Drunk driving kills people, and there\'s such a stigma against drunk driving that it has greatly reduced these kinds of alcohol-related deaths.  Of course, alcohol itself can kill people, but only when taken to excess and over a very long time.  Guns, on the other hand, were *designed* to kill people.  That\'s what they\'re for.  Well, many of them, anyway (some guns are indeed designed for other things like hunting).  So the conversation regarding alcohol is about a drink component that has been used and enjoyed by billions of people responsibly for thousands of years, which is completely safe in moderation but can be dangerous if abused, while the conversation about guns is about a tool designed to kill people that is only safe if it\'s *not* used.  The primary function of a firearm is to *decrease* safety to others (with a distant second function of being used in sports like marksmanship).\n\nLuckily, you actually enumerated your arguments, so this is going to be easy!\n\n> What, are you an alcohol nut? Cant let go of the bottle?\n\nBanning alcohol fails the rational basis test, while banning guns passes it.  So if you\'re in favor of keeping alcohol, you don\'t have to be an alcohol nut.  On the other hand, most people in favor of keeping guns *are* gun nuts, thanks to our polarized culture.  Guns are a big symbol of the conservative wing in the US for a variety of reasons, and there are few non-gun-nuts who actually feel passionately about keeping death weapons around.\n\n> Why don’t you care about all the dead kids in the streets?\n\nAlcohol doesn\'t actually kill those kids.  Guns *do*.  The kids aren\'t being splashed in the face with alcohol; rather, someone drinks alcohol and then does something stupid, and the kids die by accident.  We\'ve actually gone a long way to stopping those accidents by allowing bars to take away people\'s car keys and call taxis for them instead, refuse to serve customers who might be too drunk, and general policing of drinking establishments.  On the other hand, kids killed by guns are not killed by accident.  They\'re murdered.  Whoever killed them *wanted* them dead.  There\'s not much of a way to police that; criminals aren\'t *that* stupid that they\'d murder someone when they know the cops are watching.\n\n> Our corrupt politicians are bought and paid for so that the powerful alcohol lobbyists can keep making more and more money!\n\nThat\'s not actually true.  Alcohol lobbyists have very little power compared to the NRA.  Why?  Because of the Culture War, the polarization we\'re talking about, and how guns are the symbol of the conservatives in the US.  Alcohol is not.  Nobody cares about alcohol, but people do care about guns.  Perhaps if people did care about alcohol on a cultural basis like this (which they did back in Prohibition days), alcohol lobbyists would hold far more sway, but that\'s not the case now.\n\n> Saudi Arabia banned alcohol and they don’t have nearly as many alcohol related deaths as we do! Why don’t we wake up like them?\n\nBecause our alcohol deaths aren\'t *really* preventable.  By the way, we\'re not the only country that has had to deal with this.  Near Saudi Arabia, a small country called Israel wrestled with a serious drunk driving problem a while ago, so much that Subliminal and Itzik Shamly recorded one of those [big protest songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCNMViBsSgQ) about it, with a children\'s chorus and everything.  The singing is from an anti-war song from the 80\'s, sort of how Puff Daddy repurposed Sting for his tribute to Biggie, but the rapping is about all the lives lost from drunk driving.  It turns out that the solution to drunk driving is... not driving drunk.  Removing alcohol is like trying to prevent school shootings by banning schools.  People who drive drunk don\'t *want* to go out and kill people; they\'re just careless.  Give them options, give them rides, take away their keys, and the problem is solved, because alcohol is not *inherently* dangerous like guns are.\n\nMore importantly, the *US* banned alcohol too, and the number of alcohol-related deaths went way *up*.  So there\'s that.\n\n> Pro alcoholics don’t have souls! They’re evil and don’t care about saving lives!\n\nThat\'s not actually true.  That\'s not true for pro-gunoholics either, but at least it\'s less false for them.\n\n> Why can’t we support “common sense” alcohol regulations? Why can’t we DO SOMETHING?!\n\nWe do.  We support plenty of ""common sense"" alcohol regulations.  We also support some pretty stupid alcohol regulations, specifically those regarding the sale of alcohol on Sundays and holidays in some jurisdictions, not selling alcohol in grocery stores in some places, etc., but we require, for example, that people show ID to purchase alcohol (and we impose an age requirement as well); we actually install alcohol detectors in offenders\' cars to prevent them from driving drunk; we have police patrol for drunk drivers before those drivers actually cause accidents; we have laws about how alcohol can be advertised.  There are actually quite a few barriers to alcohol abuse in the US.  I think the drinking age should be *lowered*, personally, because the high drinking age is actually the cause of *more* alcohol-related problems due to young people binging on the illegal stuff.  But we already *have* common-sense alcohol regulations.  It\'s easier to buy a gun than to buy alcohol.\n\n> That abusive dad had a mental health issue and should never have been sold alcohol!\n\nThat\'s probably true.  And actually, being required to take breathalyzer tests on a regular basis to prove sobriety is actually a thing.\n\n> You’re either with us in the fight to save lives, or you’re against us in the fight to save lives!\n\nTrue.  But banning alcohol won\'t save lives, unlike banning guns.\n\n> Let’s sue the distillery that made the alcohol whenever somebody kills someone while under the influence!\n\nThis is an interesting one.  If someone is killed by alcohol, this could be a legitimate thing to do, but generally, alcohol is safe to drink in moderation.  If someone drinks responsibly and is still killed by the alcohol, then the distillery *should* be held responsible.  On the other hand, if someone is killed by a gun, that gun was actually doing what its manufacturers *designed* it to do, which is to kill people.  It wasn\'t safe when it left the factory.\n\n> Why don’t we mandate breathalyzers in every vehicle?\n\nWaste of money and time and energy and freedom.  We mandate them on vehicles of people who are at risk for driving drunk, though.\n\n> Why don’t we require a license for alcohol?\n\nWe don\'t?  I thought we did.  Joking aside, though, it\'s because you don\'t actually need special training to drink alcohol safely.  You *do* need special training to use a gun without using it as intended.\n\n> Shouldn’t we require a psychiatrist to interview people that want alcohol so badly?\n\nI\'d be OK with this.\n\n> Why does this country have such an alcohol fetish that allows our kids to be beaten and abused day after day?\n\nThis makes no sense.  Our kids are not beaten and abused by alcohol.  They\'re beaten and abused by people, *some* of whom *also* abuse alcohol.  And the solution here is to remove the abuser, not the alcohol.\n\n> Why isn’t it worth trying to restrict alcohol to save lives? Aren’t the innocent children’s lives worth it?\n\nEh.  Not really.  Restricting alcohol much further (remember, it\'s already quite restricted) won\'t save many lives (it will cause more deaths, probably).\n\n> Why does anyone need a bottle of Everclear? Why can someone literally buy a high capacity 3,240 rack of beer from Budweiser?\n\nI\'m with you on the Everclear, but this is one of those cases where restricting it does more harm because people get products that are less safe otherwise.  As for the high-capacity rack of beer from Budweiser, nobody can drink that much in a short time.  On the contrary, a high-capacity magazine enables a shooter to kill many more people quickly.  The problem isn\'t the capacity; it\'s the damage per second.  Beer has very low DPS, while bullets for ""assault"" weapons (or whatever you want to call the things that kill lots of people quickly) have *extremely* high DPS and are in fact designed for the purpose.  Buy 3240 cans of Budweiser and you\'re set for life (at some point you\'ll start pissing Budweiser, and that\'s when you\'ll realize that you\'ve been drinking piss all along, but anyway).  Buy a high-capacity rack with 3240 bullets and you haven\'t bought yourself years\' worth of bullets; you\'ve bought yourself *minutes\'* worth of killing people, because the gun you bought them for fires many rounds a second.\n\n> The 21rst amendment is outdated and needs to be revised!\n\nIt is not.  Repealing the 18th Amendment is not something that can be outdated or not; the second clause is irrelevant to the present discussion (it states that illegal importation of alcohol is illegal -- duh); the third clause was a one-off about the passage of the amendment itself with a time limit that has already expired.  So there\'s nothing to revise in the 21st Amendment because it has no content; it\'s just a container for the repeal of the 18th.  The 2nd Amendment, on the other hand, *does* contain plenty of actual material that could be revised.  We can discuss whether it should be revised or not, but there are actually arguments to be made here, unlike with the 21st.\n\n> why do these arguments make sense to so many people when applied to guns but not to alcohol\n\nI hope I was able to answer that question to your satisfaction.', 'The primary purpose for the invention, design and manufactoring of guns is to kill people.\n\nThe primary purpose for the invention, development and production of alcohol is for people to have fun.', 'If a school kid walks into a classroom holding a bottle of beer, it is unlikely that 20 seconds later that everyone in the room will be either dead, injured or hiding under a desk in fear of their lives.', 'So there\'s one major difference between these things that I don\'t see mentioned.  Some have mentioned that the purpose of guns is to kill, while the purpose of alcohol is to have fun, and that sorta comes close to the distinction I see, but I view that argument as pretty risky.\n\nInstead, the distinction that needs to be made is that alcohol does NOT enhance the *capacity* to do harm, while guns do.  This is what the anti-regulation ""Guns don\'t kill people, people do"" misses.  It has never been a serious argument of the pro-regulation side that guns, by their very nature, magically cause violence to happen (I say serious because I have no doubt that some crazy left-wingers have in fact said that, and meant it, as opposed to merely being imprecise).  Instead, the argument is that when you make it easy for all to get guns, you enable bad actors to do more damage.\n\nContrast this with alcohol.  If alcohol was unregulated, and people got drunk all the time, in what way would they be *enabled* to cause more damage than they would without alcohol?  You can\'t say car crashes, because I can crash a car stone-cold sober; even on purpose, if I want!  Same goes for pretty much any other ""under the influence"" scenario.\n\nNow a reasonable response is yes, but more alcohol means more fatalities, and it doesn\'t matter that one drunk person doesn\'t do as much damage; all that matters are the aggregate numbers.  And that\'s a reasonable discussion to be had.  But the fact remains that they are not equivalent, and can\'t be treated the same.', ""Alcohol is regulated to a degree that most people are comfortable with.  Guns are not. How about we simply aim to find an equilibrium where people have a right to bear arms, but kids can't easily obtain assault rifles and go on a shooting spree in the local high school? "", ""I do agree with further regulation of guns, but using the same logic on alcohol doesn't bother me either. Even though I drink a fair amount, I wouldn't have a problem having to buy a special license for purchasing alcohol that has to be shown along with a driver's license. I don't have a problem with a limit on how much alcohol you can have at any one time.  I would be ok with a breathalyzer in my car, and bans on anyone with certain mental health issues or history of abuse being banned from purchasing it. It would make it much easier for an alcoholic to quit if purchasing isn't even an option.\n\nWhy I don't pursue the alcohol thing is that it's easier for me to avoid those with alcohol issues by not driving late at night, and by drinking at home instead of in a bar. I am not for gun regulation because I care about others being killed. I don't want to get shot, and the more that they're allowed everywhere and for everyone to have one, that increases the likelihood for ME to get shot. I do have to do a minimum amount of things, such as go to work, grocery shop, and be able to go to some harmless entertainment like the movies. \n\nOne last point is that in the 1980s there was a huge push for more alcohol regulation and tougher fines. The group MADD was very strong then. It worked. Things surrounding alcohol issues have improved. It's one of the reasons why the age to purchase alcohol went up. You don't hear people screaming about it now, because it's been done and continues to be improved. No lawmaker would ever risk reducing the penalties for drunk driving. \n\n**tldr:** It's easier for me to avoid scenarios where I could be harmed by someone with an alcohol issue than it is is for me to avoid someone with a gun issue, and we already fought for alcohol regulation and won AND it lowered the alcohol-related deaths."", 'For me personally, the issue is absolutely non-political. I live in the US, but I did not grow up here. Owning a gun to protect myself is simply something that has never been part of the mentality of ANYONE around me while growing up.\n\nI think a big problem with your parallel is forcing a comparison with two very different things. These discussions can easily slip into arguing about semantics, rather than content. One ends up making analogies like ""I can drink half a glass of beer, can you fire half a bullet?"". This serves no purpose.\n\nTo make things worse, you will always find insane people on both sides of the debate, spewing nonsense. For example ""the 2nd amendment is in the constitution, therefore it would be immoral to change it"" Oh really? What about slavery in the constitution? Times change, and laws need to reflect that. Or another example ""If you own a gun, you want to use it. Therefore you are a killer already."" That\'s insane. Most gun owners are law abiding citizens who just want to enjoy their life.\n\nTo go back to firearms and alcohol, what I firmly believe should be done (in both cases, if you wish) is have thorough scientific studies. \n\nThe US clearly has a problem with mass shootings. That\'s undeniable. If you were in Europe, or in Australia, the thought of someone shooting you in school would not even occur to you (shootings happen, but nowhere near as frequently as in the US). A responsible government would then, at the very least, call forth a panel of independent scientists to investigate the matter, collect data, draw conclusions.\n\nWe should listen to facts. Times change, and facts need to be able to influence how we think about things. \n\nThe state of affairs right now is that the Dickey amendment prevents the CDC from even doing that. This makes no sense. And this is where it becomes political. That is why I will never vote for someone endorsed by the NRA, be it republican or democrat.', 'The main flaw I see in your argument is you’re ignoring how heavily controlled alcohol already is. In many states (most?) you can buy a gun 3 years before buying a drink. And as others have pointed out, no matter how you slice it the primary goal of a gun is to fire a projectile capable of killing a person/thing, any other use after that is just a reapplication of the same principle in a different circumstance. Alcohol’s primary function is recreational, for people to die using it generally requires their own participation. \n\nNaturally guns and alcohol should be regulated differently, I think what you’re seeing is people asking for the government to treat guns more like alcohol and thus actually do some regulation or whatever. As it stands now, for their respective uses, alcohol is far more regulated.', '- Prohibition did not decrease, but rather increased violent crime:  https://object.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa157.pdf, and sooner rather than later, our vehicle deaths will drastically decline anyways (thanks to the driverless vehicle revolution).\n\n- Gun control in non-US locations (and yes, even in different states), does statistically lead to fewer gun related deaths.  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gun-deaths-eliminated-america-learn-japan-australia-uk-norway-florida-shooting-latest-news-a8216301.html', ""The simple answer is that you are using two different things and equating them falsely. By your argument, we should be banning or regulating everything because everything can lead to the death of a person. \n\nWater is terrible. Everyone who interacts with water dies. We should consequently ban water! Now the problem is solved!\n\nWhile this is absurd, it illustrates the absurdity of your argument. It is false equivalency. Guns are tools designed to aid in the simple destruction of things from range. Alcohol is designed to produce an intoxicating effect. These are both completely different objectives. Improper use of either can lead to the deaths of innocents. However, the intentional misuse of alcohol is not going to necessarily harm others. Whereas the intentional misuse of firearms is highly likely to be directed at harming others seeing as their *use is to destroy*. \n\nSo, by having alcohol available widely, you may have higher deaths due to accidents. We can argue about the acceptable limits of such etc, but it is largely an unintended side effect. \n\nGuns, on the other hand, are different. They, themselves, don't have side effects. They are there to destroy. So, now instead of someone playing, enraged, scared, panicked, or planning hurt grabbing a nearby accessible bat, knife, club, stick, etc, they can now grab a gun because it is just about as easy to get and can cause massively more damage with much less risk to the user. By saying that guns are okay to be spread around society easily, you are saying it is okay for anyone to have access to significantly hurt anybody else easily with little risk to him/herself. \n\nOnce again, this should be an argument of like v like and yours is not. Alcohol should be compared to other similar items. And guns should be compared to things like mortars, artillery, explosives. If you are okay with guns being able to be owned by anyone anywhere with no effective oversight, you should feel the same way about other means of destruction. If not, you may want to revisit your logic. "", ""As detrimental as alcohol abuse can be to your own health it isn't to someone else's. Guns can and will be. This is false equivalence. "", 'Your argument quickly devolves into banning everything, because literally everything can be used to indirectly hurt others as effectively as alcohol. Answer me this: What is a gun made to do? What is (consumable) alcohol made to do? You made a leap from an object explicitly designed to efficiently injure/kill a living creature, to something that can be used in combination with other objects and poor decisions to hurt others. Why pick on alcohol? Why not cars?', ""You raise a valid point. The logic applied to the gun control argument could also create a similar argument against alcohol. I think the key difference lies in carefully planned violence. An alcoholic often does not intend to kill others while driving drunk. Their behavior is abhorrent too, obviously, but my point is that easy access to alcohol does not necessarily enable people to plot mass attacks. Easy access to firearms does. You can't plan to kill 20 high school students with a handle of vodka and then successfully execute your plan as easily as you could with any type of gun. So sure, alcoholism and its related damage and violence is tragic and we could argue the pros and cons of stricter legislation, just as we can with firearms, but to me the central point of the gun control discussion is mass murder and plotted attacks."", 'Yes, alcohol is dangerous and people die from it, even innocent people. But alcohol was created to make people feel good whereas guns were created to kill. They serve no other purpose. Even when used as a deterrent or sense of security, it is solely due to their ability to kill without putting the user in harm\'s way. Even Lynyrd Skynyrd acknowledged as much in [""Saturday Night Special""](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lynyrdskynyrd/saturdaynightspecial.html). \n\n\n""Mister Saturday-Night-Special\n\nYou got a barrel that\'s a-blue and cold\n\nSo ain\'t good for nothin\'\n\nBut put a man six a-feet in a hole\n\n\nHand guns are made for killin\'\n\nAin\'t no good for nothin\' else\n\nAnd if you like to drink your whiskey\n\nYou might even shoot yourself""\n\n\nThe thing that made the man in the song dangerous wasn\'t the alcohol per se, but his gun. If he was just drunk without a gun, he would have a difficult time killing someone during a card game. However, if he was sober and had a gun, he is at least as capable of killing someone during the game. \n\nAlso, alcohol is the result of a naturally occurring chemical reaction. Even animals get drunk by intentionally eating rotten fruit. Trying to ban it to the same extent as guns is like trying to ban sale of meat; I could always go out and get some from natural sources. Guns, on the other hand, have to be manufactured by men, and are the result of thousands of years of killing as efficiently as possible. ', ""We tried banning alcohol. People tried making whiskey in their bathtubs and poisoned themselves, and everybody still drank. That's why we stopped, it caused more harm than good.\n\nIf we look at countries with strict gun control laws, they generally don't have people making guns in their garages and blowing themselves up, and it's actually difficult for common criminals to get guns. There's empirical evidence to think it won't cause more harm than good."", 'I think the argument presented was very interesting and through provoking, but let me offer a rebuttal. \n\nAll of these are points of propaganda used by people that believe guns should be banned or further limited. The use of propaganda has been in politics since the early 1900\'s after Edward Bernays published his book, ""Propaganda"" causing an incredible shift in persuasive speech.\n\nThese points are strong because they warrant an emotional response, yet they do not bring into the effect the positives and negatives of both. Just like they don\'t for alcohol, and the same you could say for, as an example, cars. ""Well countries that have fewer cars have fewer car related deaths."" As you can see these points don\'t say that cars have a strong economic advantage, just the same as alcohol. The core of these inventions are surely not to create tragedy, yet all three do. \n\nThe most important action we as individuals can do is learn as much as we can do to be completely aware of all the facts and the consequences of the actions we could take. ', ""So, then why ban the distillation of moonshine?  If we shouldn't ban any guns, why shouldn't we remove any restrictions on alcohol production?"", ""Your argument would be valid if we were comparing alcohol poisoning vs. gun suicides. \n\nYou can't walk into a mall and shoot 30 people full of enough alcohol to die, and we already have wide-reaching rules against drunk driving.

At least in the state of Florida, alcohol is regulated more than guns.  ', ""Has there ever been a DUI that killed 56 concertgoers and wounded hundreds more? \n\nYou have posed a facile argument.  Alcohol is not the cause of mass deaths in the same manner that shooting is, otherwise we should also take cars into the same account that we do guns.  Far more people die in car accidents every day that from gun violence, so based on your criteria, access to driving should be limited too.  You are comparing the mass murder of a contained group of people to a vehicle accident brought on by drinking.\n\n>Saudi Arabia banned alcohol and they don’t have nearly as many alcohol related deaths as we do!

Mental health and alcoholism are two different problems, not the same thing.  You can be one without the other and I have not heard this being used as an excuse for an alcohol-related death.\n\n>Let’s sue the distillery that made the alcohol whenever somebody kills someone while under the influence!\n\nThis happens.

This country was not founded on a police state and adding a breathalyzer to every car will not make us any safer, plus who is going to pay for this?  will this be on only new cars?  I have a 1961 Jeep, should I have to put one on this car?  Silly argument.\n\n>Shouldn’t we require a psychiatrist to interview people that want alcohol so badly?\n\nAgain I think you are just making this up.  No one ever said this about having to buy a gun, let alone in order to buy a drink.

One AR-15 can quickly kill scores of people in a very confined area.  \n\nWhile I cannot find the highest number of people killed in a single DUI, I imagine that is lower than 23 (which is only number ten on the list of mass shooting gun fatalities, number one was 148.)  And while there is no way to guarantee to keep yourself out of a mass shooting (they happen at school, work, concerts, the park, lots of different places) there is a failsafe way to keep from being killed in a DUI by not being on the road.  If you take it a step further, you can lower the odds of being in an accident with a drunk driver by not being on the road at certain times; holidays, weekend nights, etc. \n\nBanning the gun that does the killing would be the same as banning the car that the drunk uses not banning the drink.\n"", 'I\'ve written about this same issue myself.

', ""I like this view, let's look at it.\n\nAlcohol is actually *heavily* regulated. As should guns be. \n\nPublic consumption is banned in most places (You can't walk down the street drinking a bottle of beer), unlike guns. \n\nSale and production of alcohol has to be done in highly regulated ways and taxed properly, tested, everything. Microbrewing and home brewers kind of skirt around this I assume, and I'm entirely unaware of the intricacies on the law around this. Meanwhile private sale of guns is a huge thing. Private production of guns... not so much, obviously.\n\nAlcohol is banned in many locations. Schools obviously generally ban alcohol on their premises, workplaces will restrict it, I'm sure many government buildings would take a dim view on it as well, if it's not banned. Same with guns.\n\nUse of alcohol is *heavily* regulated, especially what you can do after drinking. You're not allowed to drive, operate heavy machinery, be intoxicated in public, help kids drink in any way (with some exception if they're your own children and in your house). Meanwhile guns have pretty ubiquitous allowance to be carried. Your boss can tell you he won't let you carry on the job but that's not a law, just policy. You can carry while driving, while operating heavy machinery, while near kids, while walking down the street, and hilariously, while drinking alcohol.\n\nI guess the point I'm making is it's pretty easy to argue that Alcohol is just as regulated as guns are, if not even more so. It has regulations that were put in place not just for the safety of people drinking it, but chiefly for public safety.\n\nI'm not going to make a point on whether or not we should regulate guns more or less here. Just that I think your premise here isn't really considering just how heavily alcohol is regulated."", ""While it's possible to buy alcohol with the intention of self-harm or harm of neighbor that is an extraordinarily unlikely use-case.\n\nOTOH there are plenty of people who have bought a gun with the explicit intention of harming another person with it (trespassers beware)."", 'I am curious about people who want to either ban firearms all together or in some limited way....

Note I say most countries, see Saudi Arabia for alcohol and the US for gun regulation.', 'I think the short answer is that gun owners are a less sympathetic and understandable group, and that many Americans simply don\'t put a high value on the things done with guns that don\'t involve killing (eg. hunting, protection).  And let\'s be honest, gun owners haven\'t helped themselves by often implying or directly stating they\'d kill LEO if they were ever to attempt taking their guns (eg. ...from my cold dead hands...).  \n\nThe longer answer is that alcohol and guns are different in many ways, and regulated much differently. In some small ways, guns are heavily regulated, but in most ways they are not.  Eighteen year-olds can buy semi-auto rifles.  You can also buy a gun from someone else with no paperwork or background check whatsoever.  Imagine if I could turn around and sell liquor to anyone I wanted? The CDC regularly studies alcohol abuse and treats it as a public health issue.  They generally cannot do the same with guns via legislation. \n\nPerhaps most importantly, guns are often stolen or purchased illegally, which means that ""legal"" sales are the source of ""illegal"" guns.  The is generally not a black market for alcohol that kills thousands of people every year. If millions of people were buying alcohol to sell to children, or using alcohol in the commission of millions of crimes every year, alcohol would warrant more scrutiny. \n\nThe worst issue with the latter point is that there is no accounting for the externalized negative effects of gun use.  The externalities of alcohol abuse are typically borne by those who use and sell liquor, and those users and sellers of related products.  We pay higher insurance premiums because of drunk drivers for example. Bars bare some responsibility for serving drunk customers.  Alternatively, gun manufacturers generally cannot be sued, again, via legislation. \n\nWith guns, we haven\'t even attempted to do account for those negative externalities. I gully recognize that this is a country that loves guns to a harmful extent, and that a ban is likely not practical.  However, I cannot abide by is watching families and communities destroyed by guns with no accountability from gun owners and manufacturers.  If you think guns are a net positive, require the cost of a gun and bullets to reflect the cost to society.  \n\nIn short, alcohol drinkers generally own their shit, gun owners force the rest of us to pick the tab.  That is the real issue even beyond the horror of seeing dozens of people murdered (or killing themselves) on a regular basis.

But alcohol is also heavily regulated and those caught drinking outside very designated areas are punished, in some ways very severely. Even for first-time offenders.\n\nHere are my ideas for guns in America. And for the record I grew up in the rural north-east US. I got guns for birthdays, and hunted with my father from a fairly young age. I don't own a gun, but I have a lot of family who does. My mother has several guns, including a license to conceal carry a pistol.\n\nI don't personally believe we should take guns away from everyone. But lets be smart about it, like plenty of other countries with a tradition of gun ownership. Owning a gun should be a privilege, not a right. It should require so many hours of experience or x hours of training. Military style weapons that exist for one purpose alone - killing people - should be removed. Single-load rifles & shotguns should be legal for hunting purposes, but again require that strict training to be redone every few years at a modest fee.\n\nThe gun industry needs to be regulated more strictly, with routes that criminals use to get guns policed and removed. Something the ATF used to do, until scandal and a few incidents of corruption lead to the GOP dramatically reducing their funding and personnel. The reason you don't see most criminals having guns in countries like Germany, is because the only way they can buy these guns is via black markets where semi-auto rifles cost tens of thousands of dollars. Germany has a pretty strong gun industry as well, most notably Heckler & Koch, one of the most well known companies in the world in this sector.\n\nAnd finally, anyone who has been diagnosed with a mental illness, has spent time in prison, etc.. should have that privilege revoked."", ""First and foremost, the answer is that one is a weapon and the other is not. Whatever else we could go on to say about why someone wants to drink, or the damage that does often occur because of it, or the health implications, or whatever other topic, the fact remains that firearms are weapons, and alcohol is not.\n\nAlcohol, for instance, doesn't make anyone more capable of hurting, injuring, or outright killing others. It absolutely can make people *more dangerous*, since it influences how safe a person is capable of being, but a drunk driver doesn't have a higher capacity for damage than a sober one. Car crashes don't become inherently more destructive because the driver was loaded, even if the rate thereof can increase.\n\nLikewise, no one is going to shoot up a school with a bottle of vodka. No one even *can* take dozens of lives in the matter of minutes *with the alcohol alone*.\n\nThat's not to say that we couldn't do with more safety surrounding alcohol consumption. Better ways to physically prevent people driving while drunk would be a good thing to have.\n\nUltimately, they're different ball games. It is not helpful to equate the two, since one arms and empowers someone to be more destructive, while the other does not."", 'Alcohol is already more tightly regulated than guns.

There is literally no other purpose for a gun than to desroy, immobilize, or otherwise damage the intended target.  There may be positive outcomes from this in terms of hunting or personal safety, but in those situations the gun is still being used to kill, as that is it's given purpose.\n\nThose distinctions are what sparate the two for me."", 'What you’re seeing is not a logical inconsistency. It is an expression of how much people value the trade-offs involved, even if they aren’t fully aware that’s what they’re doing. \n\nEvery pro-gun-control argument makes perfect sense if you set the value of individual gun ownership to zero. If that’s your starting point, then there is literally nothing lost when restricting gun ownership. If you value alcohol consumption even the slightest bit, then there is something to lose when restricting alcohol access. So, when that is your value set, it’s not inconsistent to be in favor of more gun regulations and fewer alcohol regulations. \n\nThe reason that these arguments seem inconsistent to you is that you have a different set of values. ', ""I disagree completely with other posters about the purpose of guns. In the US right now having well-armed police forces is an absolutely necessity. \n\nHaving said that, the reason that they need to be armed is because the people that they're policing have such easy access to guns. Either way the purpose under which guns are made has much bearing on the debate. \n\nUltimately though guns and alcohol are just different. History has shown us that alcohol really just can't be effectively banned. Saudi Arabia is actually a great example of this - despite the complete prohibition and severe penalties alcohol is widely available and many people drink. On the other hand, tons of examples and data show that gun control programs can be very effective. Australia instituted a series of buy back programs, where they banned certain kinds of guns and then bought them back from their citizens to be destroyed. In 1997, under the first round of buybacks they took back an estimated 650,000 guns, about 20% of the total amount of privately owned guns. The amount of gun suicides dropped by 60% (and this is important because people attempting suicide by gun are far more likely to die than other popular methods, and people are less likely to commit suicide after a first attempt) and gun related murders  by 42%, with the largest decline being those kinds of guns that were banned. There are many other examples of countries that have successfully banned guns but it's difficult to compare them to the US because of differences of size, culture, history, politics, etc.\n\nA lot of the reason why alcohol can't be outright banned is because it's so easy to make. All you need is grape juice, sugar, yeast and time to make powerful wine.  In Saudia Arabia anyone that wants to drink either makes their own or knows several people who do. At the same time, the increased price of the black market pushes people into it. This is also one reason why marijuana prohibition is so self-defeating. Contrast that to guns, which are nearly impossible to make by a single person or small group of people. They're large and heavy enough that they're difficult to smuggle, made of metal and uniquely shaped so they can be easily spotter metal detectors and scanners. \n\nSo just on a practical level a ban on guns wouldn't be self-defeating like a ban on alcohol. On the level of more regulation, I think you'd be surprised how many people would support more regulations surrounding alcohol. I for one think that it should be mandatory to take a 2-3 hour class on drinking and the dangers associated with it before graduating high school and again when you get your permit, and then take a separate written test before you can get your license and that alcohol commercials should be banned the same way most tobacco advertising is. \n\nBut even if you don't agree in further regulating one or the other, they're so different that pointing to the other side just isn't relevant. You're not wrong at all that alcohol is a problem but that doesn't mean anything in relation to the gun control debate. If you were talking about banning or regulating high powered automatic weapons and rifles, or rifles and shotguns, or everclear or liquor then it would be pertinent but a public health issue and gun control are wholly different. "", ""First of all alcohol is a choice you make to yourself. You don't choose to get shot by someone.\n\nSecond, we have stronger regulation/laws on alcohol than we do with guns.

Drinking in the streets is illegal - lets say guns in the street are illegal too.\n3. Drink driving is illegal. Lets make carrying guns in cars illegal too.\n\nThis was just off the top of my head, but I think you get the idea. In order for your argument to be valid, guns should at least be brought **up** to the safety of alcohol right now."", 'I actually agree with your basic premise: that alcohol and guns are morally similar and if one supports regulating one, they should support regulating the other. **However,** the United States *does* have strict regulations on alcohol. It\'s illegal to drink in almost all circumstances below the age of 21, for instance, and it\'s illegal to perform certain difficult tasks (like driving) while under the influence. People who have committed certain crimes or who are on probation are not allowed to consume alcohol, and in many areas public intoxication is a crime.\n\nNo such rules apply to guns. In many areas, one doesn\'t need a license to purchase a firearm. One can operate a firearm at much younger ages than they can consume alcohol (in some states, like Wisconsin, from birth and without a safety class), and there is nothing to keep felons from owning and procuring guns.\n\nIn some cases, guns should be regulated differently from alcohol: for instance, there\'s nothing inherently dangerous about driving with a gun, but it *is* dangerous to take a loaded weapon into a high-density area.\n\nBut arguing that guns should be legal but better-regulated is, in fact, consistent with the idea that alcohol should continue to be legal and regulated. *""Why can’t we support \'common sense\' alcohol regulations?""* By and large, they already exist.', 'Fifth rule of Fight Club: one fight at a time.\n\nNever mind any other merits or difficulties of banning alcohol; the struggle to do anything about gun violence in the US will me more than difficult enough to keep people away involved fully occupied.

You could tell that just from statistics: How many countries are there that banned guns? And how many banned alcohol? This difference has many reasons.\n\nOn the one hand, alcohol is a source of pleasure and enjoyment. It is very hard to take it away from people, as the prohibiton has shown. When they aren\'t able to buy alcohol, people just brew their own - this is not possible with guns. Or at least, it is very difficult to build your own rifles in your workshop at home. \n\nOn the other hand, alcohol is an important part of culture. It is connected with many holidays and rituals. It\'s a social drug, people often meet to get drunk together. Banning alcohol (even if I, personally would maybe even welcome such a ban) belongs into western culture. taking it away would be similar to banning turkeys on Thanksgiving or forbidding Christmas trees.

The difference in gun violence is that a gun is to used escalate or deescalate situations rapidly with the ""intent"" on harming or killing others. \n\nI do agree that you can say guns are also beneficial in that they can be used as a form of deterrence or assurance that you have the power to protect yourself and your loved ones from harm. But I believe this should apply only to pistols and not semi-automatic/larger weaponry. Most mass shootings are caused by larger guns, banning them should not stop you from protecting yourselves. \n\nBanning all guns IS NOT the same thing as banning all alcohol. Guns have different types and are consistently used as weapons, therefore should be placed under stricter laws/restrictions. Alcohol is a drug, just one of the most popular ones. \n', ""There is a logical consistency. We know that prohibition of alcohol made everything worse, and so long as people desire guns like they desire booze, than a prohibition on guns won't work either.\n\nOn the other hand, complete deregulation of alcohol would be a disaster too. There are policies in place to try and mitigate the damage that alcohol consumption can do eg if you get a dui your license is taken away.\n\nWhat's being asked for isn't a total prohibition on alcohol, but some for of regulation that can mitigate the damage. Now, when approaching policies that regulate guns, we have to consider the differences between guns and alcohol. For example, guns are made with the inent to kill, alcohol is not. Guns have changed over the years and have the ability to cause more damage, alcohol has had no such change. Potential deaths as a result of alcohol are predictable, they happen on weekend evenings for the most part. A massacre involving guns is not so predictable. With alcohol, the number of people that can be killed is not nearly as as what can happen with an automatic rifle. Alcohol has many use cases besides killing people, which isn't actually a use case of alcohol at all. Guns... Well they were made for one sole reason.\n\nThe volatility of guns is much greater than alcohol, and that's definitely not an exhaustive list. So when it comes to gun regulation, expect it to be a lot more strict than alcohol regulation. Also consider that alcohol is much more widely used than guns. Being in a room with bottles of alcohol is easy, but being in a room with an assault rifle can be really unnerving. It's a killing tool, and comparing it to alcohol almost isn't justified."", 'There are many regulations regarding alcohol brewing, distilling, transporting, distributing, sales, serving, and even giving it away for free.  The industry is tightly controlled.\n\nAdditionally, there are many regulations regarding consumption, and one\'s actions after having consumed alcohol.\n\nThe argument that people who want more gun control should also want more alcohol control implies that there are additional laws that would both allow legal alcohol consumption yet also increase the safety of us all.   Simply increasing the number of regulations does not make anything safer, the regulations have to *make sense*.\n\nNow, for firearms, the argument is that there are a great many possible gun control laws that could be enacted which would continue to allow legal gun usage, while also increasing the safety of the public.  Some would call these laws ""common sense"" (tho\' I hate that term).  Some would argue that minor inconveniences, such as waiting periods are an easy lift, that background checks are not terribly intrusive, and that \'firearm restraining orders\' are very well targeted to avoid catching those who pose no threat.  These laws could, if enacted at a federal level, make it considerably less likely that someone who struggles with either depression, or rage issues could get immediate access to a firearm.\n\nSo the equivalence issue here is that we\'ve already grabbed all the low-hanging fruit for alcohol related regulation.  We *tried* being much more restrictive in the past, and the negative consequences were too great (we started the Kennedy clan\'s rise to power, for example).  So we\'re always trying to find the sweet spot between unfair restriction, and unwise relaxation.\n\nWith guns, we have some interesting re-imaginings of the 2nd Amendment that have made it very difficult to get to that regulation sweet spot. \n\nAs someone who loves my alcohol (Hell, I bring my bartender with me when I go places), I face a large number of regulations whenever I chose to consume.  To stay lawful, I don\'t drive, of if I am going to drive, I am very mindful of my consumption to stay well below the point of impairment.  I don\'t transport open containers of alcohol in mycar.  I don\'t buy alcohol or give alcohol to kids.  I even keep an eye out on other bar patrons to help my favorite bars be aware of their sobriety from time to time.  This is all an inconvenience, of course.  But it is all well worth it, because nobody has to die.', ""Do people who advocate for restrictions on the sale of guns oppose restrictions on the sale of alcohol? \n\nI guess I'm not aware of this inconsistency. Restrictions on the sales of alcohol (ie, to people under 21 and extending liability to people serving alcohol negligently) as well as strict enforcement of anti-drunk driving laws has cut drunk driving deaths by 75%. If anything, people who want to reduce firearm deaths should look at the common sense, minor, almost universally accepted alcohol restrictions. "", ""Two things to consider: Alcohol's primary purpose is not to hurt other people, and two, alcohol related deaths are not only car accidents or the like. A part of that total is alcohol poisoning, liver failure, or even one on one fighting. There is also a difference in intent; again, alcohol's primary purpose is not to kill. While drunk, however, you can be more irritable, making violence more common. But the difference is that with a gun, your *intent* is to hurt people, whereas with alcohol, your *intent* is to have a good time, yet the *result* is hurting people.\n\nIn regards to physical fights, someone can just choose to not fight or argue and escalate the situation. You cant choose to not get shot. DUIs are different, and those are really the worst thing about drinking. I honestly wish DUIs were more heavily punished. It severely puts people's lives in danger and should be heavily heavily punished."", ""There are too many points I disagree with here for me to respond to, but I think it boils down to this:\n\nLots of things are regulated to varying degrees in the United States: Guns, cars, drugs, alcohol, raw milk, Kinder eggs, etc. These regulations were passed as a result of the political capital on either side of the issue, and special interest groups block regulations in all sorts of instances. Logical consistency is not something you're going to find across industries, due to the political reality of the situations. The main reason why alcohol is generally legal and heroin is completely banned is because there are already a lot of big alcohol companies, and no heroin companies. It's not because there's some kind of cross-industry regulatory consistency.\n\nBut fact is guns have more potential to cause *intentional* deaths than anything else, which justifies knowing who is buying them. You keep saying that guns are for protection and not killing, but to me, this argument puts the burden on everyone else to trust gun owners to use their guns responsibly. Why should I trust everyone to use their guns responsibly 100% of the time?\n\nUltimately, millions of people use alcohol every day in ways that don't result in deaths. Firing guns have a much more deadly ratio of use.\n\nAnd finally, alcohol is already restricted in some of the ways you mention above. For example, if you're struck by a drunk driver, you can legitimately sue the bar or social host that served the alcohol to the driver."", ""A gun's ability to be extremely efficient at taking human lives in great numbers deserves to have far more controls to ensure those that intend to use them maliciously are prohibited from owning them.  This would include the mentally ill, ex-felons, children, etc. New technologies like finger print readers could help reduce guns that get in the hands of criminals as an example.  Ultimately however, we as a society need to stigmatize gun loving like we did/do cigarettes and make this a social problem in addition to more controls.   I'm all for more controls for alcohol like having all vehicles equipped with some type of breathalyzer to keep drunks off the road, but I really don't see how else we can control alcohol beyond what we have e.g , age verification, BAC reductions to near 0, work related BAC testing after accidents, etc. "", '[removed]', ""First of all, I claim your argument makes the logical fallacy of false (or in some sense, selective) comparison. That is, you try to compare two things, with an isolated view on these two only, disregarding all other comparable similar instances.\n\nYou haven chosen to highlight a single other regulation. There are plenty of others.\n\nTo illustrate this, I'll make a counter claim: Because you are against gun regulation, you necessarily must against traffic regulation such as traffic lights. Traffic lights hinder my basic right of freedom of movement, and could be used by a tyrannical government to hinder the citizens from organizing a resistance movement. Cars are not dangerous, people not driving carefully are. If all people drove carefully, no traffic regulation would be necessary.\n \nConversely, let's imagine for a second that traffic rules were not yet in place, and that traffic would be completely and utterly unregulated. Your argument could then have been, that people that are in favor of traffic regulation must necessarily also be in favor of gun regulations. Which as you hopefully can see is somewhat absurd."", 'This is a false equivalency.\n\nThe proper equivalency would be that advocates for gun bans should also advocate for breathalyzer ignition devices in every car.', 'Should we also ban cars?

It was the correct thing to do in theory. In practice, it is an impossible endeavor. It is too easy to make alcohol. Firearms require specialized machinery and intense quality control. We know that banning alcohol results in the same amount of alcohol in American's hands, but also causes more problems (like crime lords).\n\nBanning firearms is actually effective at making them disappear, which is the concern of gun advocates. It also doesn't cause immediate problems but does provide immediate solutions."", 'The rational for wishing to ban firearms stems from the desire to limit the harm a person can do if they make a bad decision.\n\nNearly every tool allows some amplification of harm. You can misuse a knife or a can opener or a live salmon to kill someone, though the effort involved is probably greater.\n\nThis is not a binary choice but a chosen point along a spectrum. Knives ok, firearms not OK.\n\nAlcohol does not make bad decisions more harmful, but it does make them more likely. We could extrapolate from this that people who wish to ban alcohol believe people fundamentally make good choices and that alcohol causes them to depart from that norm whereas people who want to ban guns think that people often make bad choices and that there is thus value in limiting the harm those bad choices cause.\n\nBoth seek to reduce net social harm, but they seek to do so in different ways because of different beliefs about people.\n\nYou could go further and suggest that not only is seeking to ban one but not the other logically consistent, but that it would be logically inconsistent to attempt to regulate them in the same way for the same reason ', ""Banning alcohol has been tried during the prohibition in the 20s. Long story short, didn't work too well, people still bought alcohol on the black market and there was a huge increase in gang violence. \n\nNow, you might say that there would be the same problem with guns, people would just buy them on the black market. However, this is not what we have been able to observe in the countries where stricter gun control laws have been implemented. Australia is a very good example.\n\nI think you make a false equivalence beetween guns and alcohol, because both can cause harm to people. However, I think that alcoolism always has a deeper lying cause (depression, poverty, etc.) that we should try to tackle instead. \n\nOf course you could say that the same is true for school shooters (they suffer from depression/mental illness). The problem here is that we can't prevent every single case of mental illness, but just one single person that we weren't able to cure can cause dozens of deaths.\n\nAs things are right now, implementing stricter gun laws and keeping alcool legal (while still trying to prevent alcoolism and its causes) seems like the right path, especially considering historical evidence."", 'I see the same points being made and same counter points being brought up: Alcohol and firearms are developed with significantly different purposes and so the logical inconsistencies in their legislative regulations are justified.\n\nI agree that the rhetoric we hear following a mass shooting is often lacking in some manner, I believe this to be as a result of those arguments being driven by an emotional response to the tragedy. I saw a couple posts already pointing out that while you are using alcohol as the crux of your argument, it appears that the combination of alcohol and a vehicle is more strongly your point.\nlooking to poison control for additional stats: https://www.poison.org/poison-statistics-national we can see that firearms do indeed rank lower than either drug related deaths, or motor vehicle deaths. Not by a large margin, and alcohol related driving fatalities account for less than a third of drivings total.\n\nAll this is to say that when presented with information which seems to suggest that a single product is attributed to such a significant amount of death and violence it is worth considering heavier restrictions than are currently in place.', ""Because you cannot use alcohol on it's own to kill other people with anything like the efficiency of guns.\n\nFirearms debates are mostly a dichotomy between a person's rights to do as they please and other peoples right to their own safety (to minimmize risk to themselves)."", 'First.

You can wear down a gun into uselessness, I guess, eventually, but usually you can have the same gun for decades and use it. You can\'t have the same bottle of beer for decades and drink it. A closer metaphor might be bullets. Also, alcohol purchases are age-restricted, which is something.\n\nWe do not require a license for bullets, but they enable a bunch of bad things to happen, and maybe we should have some more rules around them.

Maybe if a person is buying a lot, we should check on their intent (""are you having a party at your place, dude?"").

Similarly, firing a registered weapon at a gun range does not endanger anyone other than yourself.\n\nI'm going to draw a couple of equivalencies that you or may not agree with.\n\nConsuming alcohol in your own home is equivalent to keeping a gun in your house. Both have risks of children accessing them and dying (alcohol poisoning, or shooting themselves), but generally don't endanger anyone else (kids getting drunk with their friends would be equivalent to playing with a loaded weapon with their friends). In both of these cases, most people are consistent in believing they are both okay.\n\nNext, consuming alcohol and driving is equivalent to walking around in public with a concealed loaded semi-automatic weapon. In both cases, no one can immediately tell that you are endangering them (there's no flashing sign on your car that tells other people you're drunk, and there's no flashing sign that tells them you're carrying a deadly weapon). Both of these have a relatively high likelihood of causing multiple people other than yourself to die. For example, getting in an accident and killing 2 or 3 other people while driving drunk, as compared to someone who is mentally unstable going and shooting someone, or a perfectly sane person simply getting in a heated dispute (see road rage, people get pissed off easily) and one of the multiple possible parties involved having a lapse in judgement and gaining control of the gun and discharging it.\n\nSo, if you agree with the premises up to this point, now consider that alcohol regulation is already more strict than gun regulation in most areas.\n\n- Minimum drinking age is 21, there is no federal minimum age to own a firearm, but most states set the age at 18.\n\n- You cannot carry open alcoholic beverages in public, but you can carry loaded semi automatic rifles or handguns in many places (or even carry them concealed, which is even more dangerous).\n\nWe buy and consume alcohol in designated areas (equivalent would be a gun range).

There's also the significant factor of intent, which you've already edited - the analogy is not great\n\nA better analogy would be with cars - cars kill loads of people, so why not further restrict their use? They're both tools (guns and cars) that can be misused and disrespected, and both can end up being used against innocent people \n\nThing is - again - driving licenses *are* well controlled and regulated already, where-as guns are not. The police have only to search a centralised database for vehicle registration and driving permits (can't with guns)  or a court has only to deny or remove a license for an offense (can't with guns) ...  even though cars and transport can be life and death for vast areas of the country.

Most deaths caused by alcohol are self inflicted, I believe we can discount those as I think people should have the freedom to choose to do things that may harm them. Drunk driving however is a problem where the victim didn't have agency.\n\nRelating to the gun analogy, I think we can discount suicides in the same manner and think only about violent intent.\n\nThe reason why I would ban guns but not alcohol is that I believe we can solve drink driving _without_ banning alcohol but don't know how to solve gun crime without removing guns.\n\nFor example, I think that socially stigmatising drink driving helps an enormous lot. In my country, public opinion about drink driving is changing with newer generations, people find it increasingly unacceptable which is leading to a reduction in drunk driving related deaths. Couple this with good public transport and I think there is a good solution and I expect this to improve over the coming decades. Finally, driverless cars may be a silver bullet for the problem of drink driving.\n\nI have no similar ideas to solve gun crime, without banning guns. Maybe I could think of ways to curtail it, but certainly no long term, viable solutions as I described above."", ""We tried banning alcohol, it didn't work.\n\nOther countries have successfully banned guns.\n\nThe big difference is alcohol is a hell of a lot easier to produce then guns."", 'Some of the example ""anti-alcohol"" statements you provide are actually used/true.\n\nAs I know more about French culture/politics than American ones, I\'ll focus this comment on France.\n\n> Our corrupt politicians are bought and paid for so that the powerful alcohol lobbyists can keep making more and more money!\n\nIn France, about 110 members of parliament are members of ""Association nationale des élus de la vigne et du vin"" (national organisation of vine and wine elected representatives, a anti-wine-regulation organization). The French parliament has a total of 878 members.\n\nAlso, just as an example, one of the many French wine lobby has a yearly budget of 5.5M€\n\n> Saudi Arabia banned alcohol and they don’t have nearly as many alcohol related deaths as we do! Why don’t we wake up like them?\n\nAlthough I am anti-gun, I agree this argument is a fallacy.\n\n> That abusive dad had a mental health issue and should never have been sold alcohol!\n\nWell, it would kind of make sense. But it\'s much harder in practice, because people buy alcohol on a regular basis, so checking their history would be more complicated.\n\n> Let’s sue the distillery that made the alcohol whenever somebody kills someone while under the influence!\n\nIn France, there are situations when shops are not supposed to sell alcohol to someone, and they can be sued if they do.\n\n> Why don’t we mandate breathalyzers in every vehicle?\n\nIn France, they are mandatory in every vehicle since 2013.\n\n> Shouldn’t we require a psychiatrist to interview people that want alcohol so badly?\n\nPeople who want alcohol badly are alcoholics and/or use alcohol to cope with some (mental) health issue. So it would be a good thing for them to at least ask them to see a psychiatrist to deal with that issue.\n\n> Why don’t we require a license for alcohol?\n> Why isn’t it worth trying to restrict alcohol to save lives? Aren’t the innocent children’s lives worth it?\n\nSelling alcohol requires a license. And it\'s the bartenders\' responsibility to look after people in their bar to make sure they are safe. In France, they are not allowed to sell alcohol to people who are drunk.\nThis also applies to service stations that sell alcohol.\n\nIn some American states, selling alcohol to pregnant people is illegal.\n\n> Why does this country have such an alcohol fetish that allows our kids to be beaten and abused day after day?\n\nThat\'s a legitimate question. Not just for your country, but for most (all?) countries.', ""You put alcohol in your own body, you put bullets in someone else's. \n"", 'You forget one small detail: reality.  \nWe already banned alcohol and know how that ends.  \nWe already have countries that have gun bans and know it works.  ', 'One major difference between guns and alcohol is that people sometimes have short lived impulses, fears, or go through situations in their lives, where if they were given a weapon, they would use it. Moreover If it \'s there, a weapon that \'s used to harm people constantly reminds you that you have the possibility to use it. And when you pair that with a sociopath, the result is mass shootings. It\'s the same with impulsive suicides. That\'s why you see for example that Japan has banned access to the ""suicide forest"". There is no analogy with alcohol which can do the same amount of damage. Just check most northern Europeans. Many of them get drunk in a ""casual Friday"" or Saturday night, yet there aren\'t dozens of victims every weekend in these countries.\n', 'This all or nothing view gets us nowhere. You can’t combine issues. By that logic if we ban or legalize alcohol, we have to ban or legalize guns equally. So nobody gets guns and alcohol or everyone gets guns and alcohol, you might as well throw everything else in that can possibly harm or kill as well(cars, knives, drugs, etc.)\nThese topics are separate and should be handled separately. Whether or not are regulations currently are right or wrong is a different problem, but you don’t want to just have anything that can possibly harm or kill someone lumped together and regulated/banned equally.', 'You seem to be deciding that loss of life is the only deciding factor here. The number of dead. That’s not the only thing that matters. We don’t judge anything solely by that metric regardless of all other context, because it would be unhelpful to do so.\n\nWe also restrict access to alcohol far more than we do to guns in terms of age restrictions, and licensing in those who are allowed to distribute it lawfully.\n\nThe primary issue is the function of guns versus the function of alcohol. As with cars, which a lot of people bring up as a comparison also. Yes, cars kill a lot of people, cars also transport people and goods and are a fundamental basis of the modern economy, they don’t JUST kill people. Alcohol is dangerous and can result in death, but that is not its primary purpose, and it is heavily regulated just as driving a car is, more so than guns in some states.\n\nGuns are inherently dangerous and are used to inflict violence. That’s their purpose. You want to bring up target shooting or something? Fine, keep the gun at the club in a lockbox for when you want to go shoot targets. There’s no need to have it strapped to your body. Hunting as well, fine, certain types of weapons, certain conditions and restrictions for their use.\n\nIt’s the ‘conceal carry for protection’ or ‘home protection’ arguments that don’t hold up if you want to argue that the primary purpose of a gun isn’t to inflict violence in the way it actually isn’t for alchohol and automobiles. In those cases, somebody is saying ‘I want a gun because it makes me feel safe against possible or imagined threats’, and the counter arguments is that the cost of that false sense of security for is too high to be worth paying with the blood of others.\n\nDeflecting the argument to other things that also kill people doesn’t absolve guns of their role in constant mass shootings. I’m not even American, but when I see another one of your shootings on the news, my reaction these days is usually ‘sure, another one, of course’. There’s no horror left in me as an outside observer watching endless circular arguments like in this thread about how America is unique and that’s why any restrictions wouldn’t work anyway, or this slavish devotion to a constitution that requires and was designed with amendments in mind, an utterly corrupt political system that allows a minority group lobbyist to impose its will on the majority in a supposed democracy, or that mental health is the real issue as if the rest of us don’t have that same issue.\n\nThe simple fact is, access to guns and a paranoid gun culture means this will keep happening, no matter how much people try to intellectualise it instead of taking the obvious steps to mitigate it.', 'I\'ve never met someone who wanted to regulate guns that didn\'t want to regulate alcohol. Alcohol is actually fairly well regulated, and that is despite it not posing a direct threat to others, and it not serving as a force multiplier for those who wish to pose such a threat.\n\nYour central premise, that liberals don\'t want to regulate alcohol, seems to be unfounded, since they have regulated alcohol and continue to work to reduce it\'s risk (while conservatives, at least locally, are constantly attempting to loosen those regulations).\n\nOn top of that, we *did* try to ban alcohol completely! We wanted to do it so bad we amended the constitution to make it happen! It was a disaster. The previous alcohol situation (which is similar to how the gun situation is now) was *also* a disaster. The current alcohol system of heavy regulation and consequence enforcement, developed specifically with alcohol the consequences of it in mind, has been better than either of the other alternatives, and continues to be tweaked and improved and paired with funding for services to help reduce and counteract the effects. Very few people sabotage these efforts while complaining about their ""right"" to alcohol.\n\nThere\'s no evidence bans on guns would result in the same sort of prohibition did - and even then there\'s very few people who have any interest in banning guns! So even your ""consistency"" argument is pretty flawed at two fundamental level - it is perfectly consistent to treat different actions, that would have different results, differently, and in this case many people actually do tend to have similar opinions on these issues.', ""I thought about this as well, as I was commenting on the fact that prohibition of guns seems successful around the world, yet prohibition of alchohol & other drugs has been a complete disaster.\n\nI think it comes down to the purpose of whatever it is in question: We use drugs to achieve a different state of mind, and experience reality differently - potentially as a form of escape from our daily lives, if our daily lives don't satisfy us. Therefore, prohibition of this kind of thing will never work, as there's no other actual or realistic way of achieving these states of minds other than to take the drug.\n\nGuns on the other hand are not used to achieve a different state of mind - they are used for pleasure/protection (the latter argument for which I deem pretty moot, considering the success that prohibition of guns has had across the world), and pleasure can be achieved through an incredibly varied number of other hobbies & activities.\n\nTherefore I don't deem it logically inconsistent to be for prohibition of guns, but against prohibition of alcohol/other drugs, as the two are for fundamentally different purposes, and therefore require different regulatory processes."", 'Very easy.\n\n\nGuns were made solely to kill or at least seriously injure people.\n\nAlcohol was not. \n\nSame as cars, knives, and other such things that are often quoted as being equivalent to guns and should be controlled as such.', ""I don't see how the two are connected, and connecting the two causes does nothing but hurt both of them.\n\nAlcoholics mostly cause harm to themselves, too.

Why are they far more regulated? If you support less gun regulation you should support deregulation of nuclear weapons.

Id just go brew my own."", '>What, are you an alcohol nut? Cant let go of the bottle?\n\n\n\nWe use those arguements already. We call them alcoholics.', 'The problem with your first question is that it is impossible to ban “all” weapons. Literally anything can be used as a weapon (rocks, sticks, books, pencils etc) . You cannot legislate human behavior to the extent of peace on earth. I dream of a time where we can look back at the idea of violence and think “wow what an archaic idea from a barbaric time”. But sadly we are no where near that point. \n\n\nAs for the second question. No the vast majority of gun owning Americans would be extremely opposed to giving up their AR-15’s (or any gun) and allowing the police to maintain theirs. As gun owning Americans we have been taught (intentionally or otherwise) that allowing a governing agency access to all the weapons leads to suppression of human rights. Is that a valid concern? Possibly, but I’m afraid I’m not qualified to debate the validity of that idea. \n']"

"Regarding mass shootings and gun regulations, I need to get some things off my chest","Honestly I expect to get massive flak for this post, but I am left leaning and honestly trying to grow in my views. I am open to learning or considering things that I may not have already, and am willing to hear any feedback, positive or otherwise. What I say is going to be offensive to some, so keep that in mind before reading. 
 
 First and foremost, I am strongly against any new regulations regarding the legality of “assault weapon”. I am for more stringent but fair background checks. I also stand with having a ccw style class requirement for most/all of firearm types, not just handguns. Simply put, this type of class is a one day course that goes over firearm law, what to and not to do in likely situations, a contains both a written and a proficiency test. These classes would have to both be affordable and available for everyone legally allowed to purchase firearms. However, I am strongly against these classes being prohibitively expensive or repeating, because in all likelihood the people who actually need firearms would probably not be able to take them in such circumstances. 

 This paragraph is going to be the most disagreeable, but try to hear me out as objectively as you can. Mass shootings are tragic, there are no words that can capture how horrific they are. Firearms are the leading cause of death for persons 1-19 in the US… a staggering and horrifying statistic. However, the majority of gun deaths are suicides, and most of all the remaining deaths are from violence on the street, not in  other public places. Banning assault weapons simply is not going to put a dent in these statistics, as the vast majority of shootings are actually done with weapons bought on the illegal market. It would take decades and decades for a ban to force these weapons to dry up, and leave law abiding citizens with worse tools to defend themselves with. Given the same political climate, even after they dry up, the violence will not. This can be proven with the fact that many mass shootings have been acted out with traditional hunting style weapons, unfortunately with many being killed. My point being, it is the social and political climate that drive gun deaths, not a lack of regulation of what type of gun a law abiding person can or can’t have.

 Many of you will then ask, why even own these “assault weapons”? Because they are the best tool that anyone can protect themselves with, and that really is it. Many bring up shotguns for being the best home defense tool, but they can be awkward and difficult to use, especially for smaller statured people. They absolutely will over penetrate and fatally harm innocents through multiple walls if used improperly, just as any firearm will. If any of you have a smaller spouse or young adult living at home, realize that they are infinitely better off defending themselves with something small and light recoiling, and not with a 12 gauge loaded with buckshot…

 I truly hope I haven’t stepped on too many toes with this post. I hold no belief that my views or mind are infallible or can even approach the likes of greatness. I am genuinely trying to grow in my philosophy, so I highly value any insight whatsoever.

John Crump has half the answer:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fp_jFH5AFvw\n\nI emailed him this:\n\n∆∆∆\n\nHi John,\n\nI'm not criticizing your video on this. You're absolutely right so far. Here's what you haven't caught on to yet.\n\nFirst you have to understand that all mass shooters are suicidal. The mass shooting attack itself is always a suicide attempt. It's not always successful but it is always an attempt.\n\nYou next need to look at suicidal contagion, which is a well understood phenomenon in psychological literature.\n\nTHIS PROBLEM EXISTS INDEPENDENTLY OF THE ATTRACTION TO FAME.  The kicker is that in suicidal contagion (without violence to others) the thing that tends to link the first suicide to the second either suicide or attempt is that the second one will see in the first one some aspect of role model issues of their own life.\n\nSo let's say a teenager reads in the local newspaper whatever that another teenager killed themselves by jumping in front of the local subway. Light rail. Whatever you call it.\n\nEven if the name of the first person committing suicide that way isn't mentioned or anything about the family history or story or anything like that, you can still get suicidal contagion.\n\nWe recently had a mass shooter in California who was an elderly Asian guy, which is normally the last demographic you would suspect for something like that. And then a week later we got another. Now think, was this about elderly Asian dudes all of a sudden becoming more dangerous? Of course not. The second one saw the first as a sympathetic similar character. That's exactly how suicidal contagion often works and since mass public shootings are a form of suicide, there you go.\n\nIf I'm right, we are now at risk of having a female to male trans person of some sort go on a mass shooting rampage.  Not because that's a dangerous demographic, it's absolutely not. It's because, if there are any crazies of that sort out there, right now is the most likely time when one will crank off.\n\nTake a look at this:\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8153751/\n\n∆∆∆\nAbstract:\n\nThe number of subway suicides in Vienna increased dramatically between 1984 and mid-1987. In the second-half of 1987 there was a decrease of 75% which has been sustained for 5 yr. This reduction in subway suicides began when a working group of the Austrian Association for Suicide Prevention developed media guidelines and initiated discussions with the media which culminated with an agreement to abstain from reporting on cases of suicide. The characteristics of suicide and attempted suicide on the Viennese subway are discussed and appropriate guidelines for media coverage of suicidal acts are presented.\n∆∆∆\n\nJim again.  If you dig deeper into the data on this and related cases (see the list of other papers mentioned right there at the link) you find reporting on these cases of specific forms of suicide such as the subway jump causes an increase in subway jumps suicides even if you don't name the people committing suicide.\n\nThat means the fame problem you talk about is roughly half the issue. The other half is plain old suicidal contagion. We have to completely shut down the reporting on mass killings.  NOT just mass shootings, not unless you want to see a wave of lunatics driving trucks through crowds and killing even more people than they can with a shotgun or whatever.\n\nHere's the kicker. The media knows about this. They know exactly what's going on. Here's proof, the US railroads begging for help FROM THE MEDIA in not reporting train suicides:\n\nhttps://www.volpe.dot.gov/news/analyzing-online-media-reporting-rail-suicide-and-trespass-incidents\n\nWe have to get one of our best supporters in congress to sponsor a bill to ban the reporting of all this shit.

CMV: A requirement to be associated with a “well regulated militia” would be a great start to curbing gun violence.,"IMO guns are awesome. Some of the best days of my life have started with a trip to the dollar store to get a bunch of nicknacks, putting those nicknacks on a berm and making said nicknacks into many smaller nicknacks through the liberal (no pun intended) application of freedom pellets. 

However, I would give that up tomorrow if I never had to read about a school shooting ever again.

I get that “a well regulated militia” meant something else when the bill of rights was written and that the Supreme Court already ruled that the right to bare arms is an individual right. However, this isn’t the 18th century anymore and our founders gave us the opportunity to amend the constitution. Why can’t we make state militias a thing and require gun owners to join the militia with requirements to train on gun use and safety? Gun ownership is a responsibility. I can think of several people I know who don’t practice the absolute basics of gun safety, but use their firearms regularly.

At the very least, this would allow a regular check in with gun owners and an opportunity for people to raise red flags if someone seems “off” or doesn’t practice good safety practices.

Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I and his two wicked sons and successors, reestablished by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!""\n\nand really the Grammer of it as well being broken down by Scalia in DC V Heller (See what a prefatory vs operative clause are and what well regulated meant back in the day) then your just ignoring reality.

I live in a country that has some of the strictest gun regulations in the world. But that just means that it\'s very hard for someone to obtain a gun legally and get all the regulations and paperwork in order (it literally requires mountains of paperwork and permissions just to have one and forget about being able to carry it anywhere). But that just makes buying one ""unofficially"" so much easier in comparison. So in reality you are left with the same amounts of guns as before (because it\'s not like they are going anywhere) it\'s just that now they are being owned by criminals who don\'t really care about getting permissions rather than law abiding citizens.', ""Well that's a generalization.

Why are some Americans against stricter gun regulations?,"I know that Marx & Engels were pro gun ownership & there is this quote from the famous 1850 speech: 

“Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.”

So I’ve always interpreted this as a quote that has more to do with how the people should be able to arm themselves against a tyrannical government in order to successfully revolt. I don’t know much about the US constitution, but I’m under the impression that the “right to bear arms” means more or less the same thing. 

I’m on board with this. However, both the Marx/Engels quote and the amendment were from a time where militaries didn’t utilize drone warfare or many of the other technologies developed in the last century for the exclusive purpose of killing a lot of people at once, very quickly. 

America has the most powerful military in the world. Unless the military were to join forces with the civilian uprising, I can’t imagine anyone would be able to carry out an armed Revolution against such a force, regardless of how many weapons they stockpile. 

In the debate regarding gun control, why do people ignore the fact that whoever came up with “right to bear arms” had no concept of the technology that would come to exist? We live in an entirely different world now, and it is evident that the relatively relaxed attitude to weapons access in America is *strongly* correlated with the absurd rates of gun violence in the US. 

I live in Canada where the gun laws are more strict but many people here own hunting rifles and such. Gun homicides still occur here at a relatively high frequency, but it is nothing compared to what goes on in the US. The two countries are comparable because they have similar cultures, demographics and economic policies. However, it can be argued that Canada has much better social programs so the disparity in gun violence between the two countries cannot be explained away by gun laws. That’s very fair. 

However, I was born in Algeria and still have most of my family there. It is a poor country, with corrupt leadership, a genuine terrorism problem, low employment, poor educational standards, low literacy, and all other markers of a “developing country”. I decided to compare the gun violence statistics between algeria and the US. America far surpasses algeria in terms of gun homicide rates. In fact, so does Canada. Algeria has stricter gun laws than both countries and despite the poverty, literal Islamic terrorists, and overall lower standard of living, gun violence is relatively low. 

So am I wrong in seeing a major part of the problem here is clearly access to guns? It’s not the only contributor to americas gun violence problem, but it seems purposefully neglectful to ignore that it’s a major contributing factor.

I’m hoping to better understand the anti-gun regulation mindset. I am not trying to provoke anyone & I don’t think I have the “right” viewpoint regarding guns. I just want to understand why so many Americans don’t think stricter gun laws will quell future massacres.

There's a middle ground between taking all the guns away (which is impossible anyway) and letting anyone who wants to buy whatever they want, but you wouldn't know that listening to the discourse on the issue here. The US has a unique relationship with guns too, which makes laws that would probably pass without much of a second thought in other countries a harder sell here. \n\nPoliticians and gun control advocates rail on about rifles, but the FBI mass shooting stats show that handguns are overwhelmingly the weapon of choice for mass shooters, it's just that, much like a plane crash, when a rifle gets used, you hear a lot about it even though it's something that happens rather infrequently. \n\nThe US is like that family that has a lot of problems but can't talk about them in a constructive way, so nothing gets solved, and guns are one of those issues."", 'Here\'s how I look at it: I don\'t like guns. I think they\'re dangerous as fuck, I probably wouldn\'t own one. That probably makes me a big pussy or whatever, fine.\n\nI also think it\'s clear that less guns = less gun violence. And by some extension less guns would probably result in fewer mass shootings. \n\nBut the problem is twofold, in the context of these mass shootings specifically: the gun control proposals I typically see in response to these shootings from liberals address things that would do next to nothing to prevent mass shootings, such as banning AR-15s or universal background checks. All these hoops are just hoops, and they\'re pretty easily circumvented. (ETA: maybe not easily, but regardless they aren\'t things that would stop mass shooters very often, many of whom passed background checks or complied with other restrictions.)\n\nAnd the second (bigger imo) problem is that the type of policy that\'s probably needed to make a meaningful difference -- some sort of buyback or confiscation program of epic proportions -- is just absolutely untenable in this country.\n\nThe U.S. has such an ingrained gun culture and such a high rate of gun ownership that I don\'t think you\'re ever gonna be able to reduce the supply to the point that you meaningfully curtail these events. Good luck telling your average rural gun owner that the government is cutting him a check for his guns. And even better luck if you\'re just trying to take them.\n\nMeanwhile the topic of gun control is such a huge political loser. There\'s a reason why Bernie always seemed to avoid the topic and wasn\'t r-slurred enough to yell out ""hell yes we\'re taking your AR-15s!"" on a national stage.\n\nSo I guess what I\'m saying is in principle, I support gun control (at least as an illiterate socialist who hasn\'t been swayed otherwise by reading leftist opinions yet). But in practice, it\'s a political anchor and the type of gun control we\'d need in order to make a difference in the US seems virtually impossible to me.

Some single issue gun voters really just don\'t like the principal of gun restrictions, and view them as an attack on the principal of the 2nd amendment, even if the proposed legislation is modest. In a way, this is kind of similar to how abortion activists oppose trimester restrictions on abortion: realistically speaking cutting abortion down to legality only in the first or second trimester (provided with exceptions like life/health/rape/incest) really wouldn\'t compromise a womans ability to get an abortion, because 93% of abortions are within the first 13 weeks and generally speaking you have a good idea you want an abortion very soon. But they just don\'t like the principal of it.\n2. The slippery slope argument, wherein they view individual restrictions not necessarily as bad, but as a slippery slope that can\'t be contained and has to be avoided at all costs, particularly federally.\n3. Gun control advocacy is, functionally speaking, cyclical. A mass shooting occurs and an enormous amount of fundraising and talking is done on the issue, but it dies down very quickly when something new pops up (this is partially a biproduct of gun control advocacy becoming heavily nonprofitized as is the case of groups like Moms Demand Action). Pro-gun advocacy, on the other hand, is a life time thing. The NRA is ultimately speaking a much better organized organization and keeps the pro gun propaganda going year round. Electorally this means you can only really hope for gun control to be a big issue if a high profile mass shooting occurs within about a week or two of an election, whereas pro-gun advocacy is tapped in at all times.\n4. The senate (and gerrymandered districts) massively overrepresent rural voters, for whom gun violence really isn\'t a big problem, but gun ownership is an integral part of life. As such, they simply do not view gun control as a priority or even desirable, why would they? it\'s not their problem, and may only make their life more difficult.\n5. some single issue gun voters are just paranoid, but most single issue gun voters are usually pretty well informed on gun issues, whether in their state, out of their state or federally. In certain cases, they see laws suggested by Dems and the rapidly changing culture of dems around guns and it freaks them out, and not always wrongly. The VA state senate tried passing a law a while back that would ban any gun with a capacity to hold over 7 rounds overnight, which would be, by definition, gun grabbing of most guns that weren\'t shotguns or six shooters (and again, would criminalize possession upon the signing of the law, so thus effectively turning a lot of people into criminals overnight). Then you had Hillary calling for the legalization of lawsuits against gun manufacturers for stuff other than negligent entrustment (like the recent sandy hook settelement where remington was forced into a settlement with the parents of the victims of sandy hook, over allegations that remingtons advertising campaigns had caused the shooter to shoot his classmates, despite very thin evidence that remington\'s advertising had anything to do with the shooters intentions or that the shooter was even aware of Remingtons advertising). I think they broadly see this as not outright gun grabbing, but rather attempts to make gun owners (including responsible gun owners) miserable, even in places where gun violence really isn\'t a significant issue. I\'d add that the changing tone among Dems on the issue of guns is particularly noteworthy. It used to be the push among dems for gun control was largely driven by urban minorities who were more focused on ensuring that gangsters didn\'t have guns for crime (mostly handguns), and so were more willing to pursue gun policy that would allow rural populations to have guns without issue, so long as guns in cities were not an issue. Now, the driving force of gun control policy among Dems is suburban women, who don\'t have the restraint that urban minorities had, and really just want to ban guns and own the rednecks they hate. You can see this shift in tone among high profile Dem celebrities. I\'ve seen at least a few blue checks essentially tweet ""yes, we know you\'re a responsible gun owner, we don\'t care, we\'re taking them from you anyhow and we want to get rid of 2a."" This isn\'t necessarily reflective of national opinion, but it\'s enough to scare gun owners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, the structural legislative reasons gun regulations aren\'t happening is simply that the senate massively overrepresents pro gun states where gun violence either isn\'t a significant issue or is largely the providence of low income urban minority poplations that the republicans don\'t care much about to begin with. The Republicans will never back gun control partially because of the NRA and partially because the single issue gun voter constituency (roughly 19% of the total electorate) is entirely Republican and absolutely will mobilize to primary a republican if htye do anything they don\'t like, so Republicans are incentivized to run to the right on the issue, even if it doesn\'t reflect national opinion (and dems the other way).', 'I\'ll try to explain, in brief. \n\nThe first thing to emphasize is that most people, even Americans who do not own firearms, have no idea how strict and complicated American firearm laws already are. Every ""gun safety"" measure is used as a wedge to make firearm ownership a legal minefield where any slip-up is a serious felony. Take the stock off one weapon and put it on another compatible weapon? Go to jail for 10 years. Take a foregrip off of one weapon and put it on your new one? Go to jail for 10 years. Drive near a school on your way to the range? Go to jail. Also, there are days where, randomly, nobody in the entire USA is allowed to buy a gun, because the federal background system is down. I\'m just talking about federal law. Every state has it\'s own laws, which can be far more restrictive and complicated. Additionally, counties and towns can make additional restrictions. \n\nThis context is important to understand the mindset: many times ""common-sense gun regulations"" were enacted it turned out to be designed to make gun ownership as difficult as possible. This makes the average gun-owning American very hostile to additional restrictions, in general.\n\nPut simply, ""assault rifles"" are not a ""major contributor"" to gun violence in the US. . ""Assault rifles"" is a very flexible word. In a technical sense this refers to fully automatic rifles, which are effectively banned for working class people for reasons I won\'t get into. However, now it is commonly used to describe scary-looking semi-automatic rifles. Rifles are responsible for only 3% of all firearm homicides, despite rifles and specifically semi-automatic rifles being a much larger portion of the firearms owned in the US. When you talk about banning ""assault weapons"" you are talking about criminalizing something that is owned by millions of Americans and disproportionately **underrepresented** in crimes. \n\n95+% of firearm homicides are from a handgun, and the overwhelming majority of those are done in 1 or 2 shots from a previously concealed weapon. Banning handguns, which are disproportionately overrepresented in homicides, is essentially impossible after [Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller). What this basically means is that, barring a constitutional amendment allowing banning of handguns, **there is no way to significantly reduce gun homicides through firearm regulations**. The logical result of this is that all proposed gun reform measures are either unconstitutional or ineffective. Gun owners are not very happy about being subject to restrictions they know are ineffective at solving the problem, but still limit their rights.\n\nFinally, I\'ll touch on ""mass shootings"". Mass shootings are a recent phenomena. They are likely largely the result of social contagion as research has suggested. Despite machine guns being legal in the early 80s and guns being *legal* in schools (my dad\'s school even had a ""gun club"" where they\'d let students bring their guns to school), there wasn\'t a problem. It wasn\'t until 24 hour news started hyping columbine that the problem got going, and psychological analysis of shooters suggests most are obsessed with other shooters and the fame they got. \n\nSchool shootings, despite all the media attention they get, are only responsible for 30 deaths per year. 25x more students die in vehicle accidents on their way to and from school. To put it in perspective another way, car-dependent American parents could save that many lives if they reduced the amount of time their kids spend in cars by **1 hour per month**.', 'I have no idea how people still argue guns have nothing or little to do with it.

Is there a point at which the amount of gun violence in the U.S. will convince you that stricter gun regulation should be passed?,"We've seen many mass-casualty events this year, where the weapon was a gun.  I understand the Constitution limits what regulation can be passed, and I don't want a legal debate about what is  possible.  I just want to understand why all efforts at reasonable, constitutional gun regulation (e.g. gun show loophole) always seem to fail.  

Edit: Rule 10",9v9nt1,143,416,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/9v9nt1/is_there_a_point_at_which_the_amount_of_gun/,"['Sure! I would need to be convinced of 4 things:\n\n1. I would need proof that reducing ""gun violence"" would actually reduce total homicides (rather than just change the method of killing)\n2. I would need proof that there is a causal link between gun ownership and homicide rates. (Not just correlation from cherry-picked data)\n3. I would need proof that that causal link was a large enough contributor to be meaningful (i.e. if our homicides are super high, and gun control would only result in a 10-20% decrease in homicides, I\'m not sure how worth it that is).\n4. I would need a persuasive logical argument convincing me that whatever reduction of homicides is worth sacrificing the insurance policy against tyranny that is associated with gun ownership. This would probably look like some actuarial accounting factoring in the projected deaths under a dictatorial regime (we could probably compare to Stalin as a benchmark) and factor that with the likelihood of it happening vs the average homicides we would look to avoid through reducing gun ownership. So, basically comparing 60 million deaths under Stalin vs. the whatever the yearly ""cost"" is of maintaining our ""insurance policy.""\n\nHere\'s some interesting charts that might illustrate why I think these questions aren\'t as obvious as you might\n\n* There seeems to be some fundamental difference in culture here leading to the difference in homicides. http://violentdeathproject.com/charts/UK%20compared%20to%20US%2020th%20century%20homicide%20rates-small.jpg -  We certainly can\'t attribute the UK\'s low homicide rate to the multiple gun laws they enacted throughout the 20th century.\n* Here\'s another - https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fourworldindata.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F03%2Fhomicide-rates-in-the-united-states-1950-2010-and-canada-1961-2009-pinker-2011-jpg.jpg&f=1\n\nBasically - the above charts illustrate the myth that all nations have the same base level of homicides and that if we just had the same gun laws then our homicides would look like the UK. Nope. Their homicides were that low BEFORE they did the bans. There\'s something else going on here - there are one or more very very significant variables besides just gun ownership.\n\n* Homicide rates vs firearm ownership - https://zachmortensen.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/homicide-vs-firearms-1.jpg\n* Homicide rates before and after gun bans - https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DJ-KA2WhhLo/UNZr8agpVqI/AAAAAAAAFH4/f6rrTVN7q6I/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-12-22+at++Saturday,+December+22,+9.26+PM.png\n* Another - https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gunfacts.info%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F03%2Faustralia-united-states-homicide-rates-before-after-gun-ban.jpg&f=1\n\nBasically, the above demonstrates that reducing gun ownership does not seem to be as correlated with reduction in homicides as might at first be assumed.\n\n* Here\'s a somewhat silly chart demonstrating that there can be other explanations for violence than just the sheer number of guns owned - https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-97h1nGqxGhU%2FUTcbWTzImiI%2FAAAAAAAAc_c%2FDo6Nb3X4WOg%2Fs1600%2FGun%2BControl%2BNOT%2BWorking.jpg&f=1\n\n-----\n\nSo in summary, yes, there is a number of homicides that would exceed the value of the anti-tyranny insurance policy. (Point number 4 above). But first you need to prove to me that those homicides were a result of gun ownership and that reduction in gun ownership would actually have a meaningful impact on reducing those homicides that would be large enough to offset the calculus outlined in #4.', 'Homicides by gun (which is the statistic that should be looked at when discussing ""gun violence"" in my opinion) reached an all time high in 1993 at 7 deaths per 100,000 people.

Getting minorities to buy firearms will result in more gun regulations,"To start, I advocate for firearm ownership, but I also advocate for more regulations. Specifically I'd like to see licensing requirements for long guns with an additional endorsement for handguns. 
Currently, firearms are almost exclusively marketed to white Christian men in the US. This is also the group that doesn't like any kind of gun regulations or minorities (generally speaking). If the market share shifts to minorities, I think a lot of conservatives will suddenly be advocating for firearm regulations. If minorities, liberals, and progressives start marching with firearms, like the conservative white men, that will also push the conservatives towards regulation. They don't see any need for regulation because their own in group is the one that owns the weapons.

Gun ownership is a RIGHT in this country, not a privilege.\n\nYou say you want stricter gun laws, but what exactly does that mean?  Installing a ""certain set of training and evaluations"" could easily be abused by local authorities to create discriminatory barriers.  Or just plain make it so expensive and time consuming that only the wealthy can get access to firearms.\n\nThe idea of someone needing to be ""worthy"" of getting a gun is exactly the wrong thinking IMHO, imho.

I won’t support licenses to own a semi auto for the same reason. It’s equivalent to a literacy test to vote. And before someone says voting doesn’t kill anyone - endless American wars and 700,000 dead Americans during the Trump years beg to differ.  \n\nI honestly feel like most of these bans and restrictions are supported by suburban liberals who can’t imagine anyone would ever need a gun for self defense.

Neither is mag capacity. We need better control in areas where gangs are a problem. Also, I think that having a gun safe is a good idea. It\'s costly but might prevent kids from accessing the firearm. And more than anything, we need a better society. Something is pushing these kids to commit those atrocities. We need to teach our kids that such behavior is wrong. Parents often see their kids as little angels and don\'t focus on factors like bullying that might affect their kids. Mental health is a problem. Let\'s address that. And finally, we should focus on taking illegal guns off the streets instead of the legal guns from someone who just likes sport shooting. \n\nI\'m also pro CCW and open carry.

Gun regulation is like a drunk running down a crowd of people and then making it harder for everyone else to possess a car or even get alcohol. The wrong people end up with the shitty end of the stick. It might help to quit giving these mass shooters so much publicity, most of them have been marginalized and exist on the fringe and I wonder if they see this as a way to get their 15 minutes of fame and finally get some kind of acknowledgment even though it is negative and it boosts their warped ego to become infamous']"

Rates of gun deaths in rural states may also be higher because delays in getting medical treatment could lead to higher mortality rates from gun-related injuries.\n\nIf you unpack the data, and remove suicides you may see that the number of gun related deaths due to homicide will be significantly smaller.

For example, while we cannot abridge the right of people to possess handguns, we CAN legislate against the import or manufacture of specific types of weapons. This could be applied to, for example, semi-automatic handguns, in that we could state that import or manufacture of that specific sub-class of handguns could be banned in the US (much like how we did with fully-automatic handguns and rifles).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2)We need to make a much faster and more intelligent means of background checks at the point of sale.

What was intended by the phrase ""well-regulated"" if the right extends to gun owners who are not part of an organised group?","As I understand it (and forgive me if I'm wrong, I'm not from the US), the 2nd Amendment was created so that there would be a standing army of the people to combat threats from outside (like the British) and inside (like a tyrannical government, or a military coup). However nowadays it only seems to be exercised by private gun owners, and organised militia groups are rare and generally frowned upon in a stable country like the US. I guess I'm asking if the right always extended to private individuals, and whether this wording has been contested.",4ossb5,4457,423,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ossb5/the_united_states_second_amendment_starts_with_a/,"['This is both an important question, and, as many other respondents have noted, also a thorny one.  While I appreciate the citation of Heller as a strong indication of modern interpretations of the history of the phrase “well-regulated militia” as seen through legal eyes, both the controlling and dissenting opinions have found dissent.  Since much of the origin of that dissent falls outside of the historical realm (and long discussion of it would violate our 20 year rule), I’d rather leave that for now and look to some historian’s interpretations, and see if that helps illuminate your question.  \n\n(Apparently I was had typed this up this morning that comment may have been removed for that reason, so sorry if I am responding to a phantom post now)\n\nJust as a caveat, though: Clearly this is a question that has sharp divides, and the context of the way the question is framed today might itself be seen as ahistorical.\n\nAs noted above, there is a well-established concern that a militia stood in contrast to a Standing Army, which was seen as the “tool of a tyrant.”  But one of the ways to answer this question about the militia specifically is to examine the historical context of what constituted a militia (and here I am focusing on the period before the Revolution) versus what did not at the time, since colonials did react to armed citizens taking up “defense” differently in different contexts.\n\nIn general, for a militia to be “well-regulated” it would have to have been mustered out by colonial authority, specifically the colonial Governor.  Other groups that owned individual weapons and “mustered out” on their own – even if was regional and massively popular – were seen not as proper militias but as illegal actors or vigilantes.  On the eve of the American Revolution in South Carolina, there was a set of vigilante groups in the western backcountry that eschewed the courts and decided to muster themselves out and attack outlaw gangs.  This “Regulator Conflict” of 1767 was not seen as a proper use of militia but instead as a criminal activity, although people in the Western backcountry saw it as simply a necessity due to lack of governmental protection afforded to people by the governments along the coast.  (I should note that western backcountry uprisings and “taking law into their own hands” is a subject worthy of an entirely other thread, one can go back to Bacon’s Rebellion as an example.) The eerie parallel is that the regulator conflicts presaged some of the complaints American Revolutionaries would have after the implementation of smuggling offenses being tried in the military Vice-Admiralty Courts – there were too few courts, too far away, although in some ways the complaints were polar opposites – the backcountry decried the lack of convictions of criminals, whereas the Vice Admiralty Courts were seen as tools of oppression, placing colonials who (in the colonials minds) were doing minor civilian infractions being sent to military Tribunals.\n\nSo not every group of citizens arming themselves and engaging in “defense” was seen as well-organized.  Also, some historians have argued there is evidence in the early Republic that the second amendment was not seen as an individual right.  I am specifically thinking of an essay in the collection edited by Saul Cornell, Whose Right to Bear Arms Did the Second Amendment Protect? – and I apologize as I do not have the book on hand and a quick google search didn’t help me find the list of essays, but I’ll come back later and append if there is interest – but one of the early essays in the book cited the example of George Washington’s experience with the Whiskey Rebellion – not only, as mentioned in a previous response, drummed out the militia to deal with the uprising, but he also ordered disarmament of the Rebels.  Therefore, the author concluded, the second amendment was not was not intended to reach beyond the militia mustered by the government.  However, the point of that text was also to show other historians who had differing interpretations as well.  It’s a good resource to examine some of the historiography of the debate.  One of the co-editors, Cornell, is famous for making an argument that the two legal methods of viewing the second amendment (individual or collective) are both not quite right, and there is a third view entirely.  Since I have not read his book on the matter – only an abstract and reviews – I cannot comment on its veracity, but as he is a rather esteemed scholar on this debate you may find it of interest as to how the framing of the debate today may be in and of itself flawed when we ask these questions.\n\nHowever, one needs caution.  I want to point out that some historical books need to be avoided.  I myself was influenced at one time by a book that was highly lauded but ended up being upended.  One of our great modern scandals involving the Bancroft Prize happened when in Emory professor Michael Bellesiles published Arming America, which tried to argue that the American value of gun ownership was more a locus of Pre-Civil War America and not a phenomena rooted in colonial, Revolutionary, or Early National America.  As a new Assistant Professor, I personally tailored some of my lectures around what was seen then as groundbreaking new scholarship.  As you might guess, it ended up that the book was an embarrassment – indeed, a lot of the evidence was simply fabricated – and it led to the Bancroft Prize being rescinded.  (I think this is the only time that has happened.)\n\nOne other area worthy of investigation is to recognize that the idea of what constitutes a militia evolves as well over time in America.  Since this goes beyond my period of expertise, and I am not specifically a military historian, I will let my colleagues tackle this if they wish, but I would point to the fact that Congress has defined the militia differently over time, and as pointed out in another response, the rise of the National Guard codified the militia in a way that was clearly different from colonial understandings.  You might wish to look at the The Efficiency in Militia Act of 1903 passed by congress to get one such example.\n\nOne last note:  Because of the politicization of the gun issue, the diminishing role of the militia in United States defense and the rise of the Professional (standing) Army has often been treated in a bubble.  But I would argue that you can see parallels in other American institutions as well, where previously services that were volunteer or privatized and sometimes scattershot begin to be seen as disorganized, unresponsive, or ill-equipped to handle the challenges of an expanding population and urbanization over time (and particularly by the late 19th and early 20th centuries) and that expanded roles for government organization and professionalization are called for:  The evolution of city watch and Sheriffs to the Robert Peel model of policing that is the foundation for much of our structure of modern police forces; there is a similar evolution from volunteer firefighters into modern professional Firefighters.  Since Police, Military, and Fire response all entail safety and all have had somewhat similar evolutions into professionalization and government institutionalization, looking at the way who is tasked to do these behaviors – and who is prohibited – may provide insight into how control over these institutions have evolved without stepping on the second amendment political landmine.\n', 'Looks like I am a little late to the party, however, I just answered a very similar question a few days ago, so [I will copy and paste it here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4obrjg/why_would_thomas_jefferson_write_in_and_founding/)\n\nSpecific question I answered: ""Why would Thomas Jefferson write in, and founding fathers put their signatures on, the 2nd amendment after Shays rebellion?""\n\nThis is an incredible question and I\'m very glad you asked.  Before I answer it, I\'d like to briefly describe what Shay\'s Rebellion actually was:\n\n**Context:** \n\nShays\' Rebellion was an armed uprising led by former Massachusetts Militiamen and Veterans of the American Revolution which took place between 1786 - 1787.  Daniel Shays led several thousand ""rebels"" to fight against the economic injustices that were facing farmers and agrarian peasants all across America.  These farmers were experiencing extreme poverty following the end of the Revolutionary War.  All across Massachusetts (and the rest of America) farmers saw their lands foreclosed on in unfair property seizers, and they wanted to fight back, which they did here.  They were also trying to fight taxes which were beginning to be levied against them.  They fought this in many ways, but among them was closing and obscuring roads so that government agents couldn\'t reach rural parts of the state.  Shays\' Rebellion would ultimately be put down, but it startled the gentry who feared further uprisings throughout the United States. \n\nI also like to point out that the naming of this event is really interesting.  The people who did this, called themselves Regulators ( [modeling off of the North Carolina Regulators](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/542884.Breaking_Loose_Together) who also fought against economic injustices before the start of the American Revolution.).  The idea of Civilian Regulation was a popular idea that sought to end government corruption and stamp out the overwhelming power of the gentry.  They believed that if the government wasn\'t regulating itself on behalf of ""We the People"", then ""the People"" had the right to regulate, or take back the government -- to take it back and do what they believed was right.  They didn\'t see themselves as a rebellion, but rather the gentry labeled them as such in order to de-legitimize their cause.  The gentry didn\'t want to call these men ""militiamen"" or ""regulators"" for this reason (which they clearly were), but instead, branded them as ""rebels"" who needed to be stopped.  \n\nVeterans like Benjamin Lincoln would raise militias on their own and mounted their own assaults against the ""rebels."" They call themselves the ""the Massachusetts Militia"" even though it was the former militias who they were fighting!  So as they begin to debate this on the national stage, especially in 1787 at the Constitutional convention, the gentry singled out Daniel Shay (even though there were actually many other leaders), and they said he was crazy and people were only following a demagogue.  They hailed The Massachusetts Militia as the victors and saviors and asserted that militias are what will save America in the future against such madness.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAlthough the Constitution was drawn up in 1787 and ratified in 1788, the Bill of Rights was not ratified until December of 1791 when the Bill of Rights was finally agreed upon.  Whether or not to include the Bill of Rights (and what to include inside it) was a matter of extreme contestation between the Founders and everything within it was deeply fought over.   \n\nWhen we look at the Second Amendment specifically, we should look at a few things before hand.  First, by the 1790s, other small rebellions had popped up all over the country.  Terry Bouton\'s article ""A Road Closed: Rural Insurgency in Post-Independence Pennsylvania"" (The Journal of American History, Vol. 87, No. 3 (Dec., 2000), pp. 855-887) masterfully explains the fighting and rebellion that took place in the rural countrysides of Pennsylvania that mirrored what had happened in Massachusetts with Shays\' Rebellion.  Simply put, the gentry were terrified that they were losing control of rural America, and as a result they would not be able to seize foreclosed land and collect taxes, which they deeply wanted.  Empowering militias to be trained and carry firearms allowed the gentry to call up these men in times of need and suppress these rebellions that were taking place.  \n\nNow there was already precedent in existence for protecting militias and their rights to bear arms in many states. Multiple other bills of rights from other states had already protected a militia\'s right to bear arms (such as [Section 13](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/virginia_declaration_of_rights.html) of Virginia\'s Declaration of Rights) and many of these states were fighting to have the federal government protect this as well.  \n\nNow, look at the very wording of the [Second Amendment](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html).\n\n>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n""A well regulated Militia""  is the key phrase. They are referring to the militias led by people like Benjamin Lincoln and his Massachusetts Militia not Shays and his ""rebellion"".  The initial goal was to protect a state\'s right to call up arms against rebels, not to arm the masses.  The Founders feared that in some states (like Rhode Island) that were already being drastically controlled by the poor (rather than the gentry), that local governments would start being able to choose who could keep and bear arms, and that by creating the Second Amendment, the gentry would always have the ability to call up and arm militias in times of need. \n\n**Clarification:** I also need to stress that this question mentioned Jefferson by name, however he was not a signer of the Constitution, but did certify the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1792.\n\nTl;Dr: The second ammendement wasn\'t passed *in spite of* Shays\' Rebellion, rather it was passed *because* of Shays\' Rebellion.\n\n**EDIT: 1**\n\nWow, what a response from everyone!

There was an exhaustive debate that took place in the public forum over many months in newspapers, journals, letters, and essays. The purpose for the 2nd Amendment was laid out for us in writings by the very men who wrote and ratified our nation\'s founding document. One such argument was laid out by James Madison on January 29, 1788.\n\nYou might remember Madison as the 4th President of the United States. What you may not remember is that Madison also penned the Bill of Rights. One of his arguments for ratification of the 2nd Amendment was published in the form of Federalist Paper #46 (an excerpt of which is provided below). Madison argued that the standing army of our newly formed nation should not exceed 1/100th of it\'s overall population, or 1/25th the size of the armed civilian population. In no uncertain terms, he states the reason for this as: \n\n""It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.""\n\nMadison was not concerned with hunting nor the self defense of ones home. He was concerned with the people not having the ability to form militias in a manner capable of fending off a standing army following the orders of a future tyrant. It is interesting how James Madison\'s math has held up over time:\n\n1788 Figures\nUSA Military Personnel: 25,000 (1/100 of 2.5M)\nArmed Militia Potential: 625,000 (25x Military)\n\n2016 Figures\nUSA Military Personnel: 2.1 Million (1/150 of 315M)\nArmed Militia Potential: 100 Million (50x Military)\n\nMany who are opposed to guns describe as ""ultra-right fringe"" those who believe the 2nd Amendment is intended to ensure the public can defend itself against a future tyrannical government. Laid before you is evidence to the contrary. \n\nPeople on both sides of the debate are entitled to their opinions. However, during the course of the debate we must ensure that we do not engage in intellectual dishonesty. If you believe the 2nd Amendment is an outdated right, then make the case that it should be repealed. However, please do not attempt to rewrite history in order to circumvent original intent in an effort to impose laws that violate our Constitution in its current form.\n\n***** Excerpt from Federalist Paper #46 *****\n\n""Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. \n\nThis proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. \n\nBesides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.""\n\n***** End of Excerpt *****', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]']"

Plus there would be a thorough background check and mental health evaluation before you could pass.\n\nSo pretty standard would be the first license that would allow you to buy shotguns/hunting rifles.\n\nNext would be handguns with the added bonus of it also giving you your concealed carry license if allowed in your state.\n\nLast would be for A/R and specialty guns I know there are lots of different guns but these 4 styles are the most well known and most frequently purchased.\n\nAnd to add on to this by putting this system in place it creates more jobs for people to teach this class which is another plus especially considering some of the best people to teach are people who have used firearms such as vets.\n\nSucks this is a moderately old post but if anyone sees this please tell me what you think of it and how it could be improved it won’t stop all gun violence people are so hung up on but I believe it would make it harder for some of the people who abuse guns or shoot up schools and stuff to legally purchase guns.', 'Gun owner here.  I think there\'s really no true compromise bc you have to give up some sort of ""right"" in order to do so. I think training/ education should be a requirement.

The facts are a lot of deaths are accidents that could\'ve been avoided with proper training/ education. You\'ll never weed out people that will snap, but people with a tendency to snap should be. If a marijuana charge (which is nonviolent) can keep you from owning a gun, any disorder or pattern that shows you are violent should do so.

A CCW class will cover the safety course as well and also means you don’t have to take the same course every time you want a new gun. Hell, I’d love to see all CCW states require shooting performance before issuing said permit. A better step would be to have national reciprocity for people who have taken the time/energy/money to get their permits.

When examining the right to keep and bear arms, either side will be looking at the marginal benefits on the scale of single digits per 100k population on an annual basis. The most clear and commonly used statistic is intentional homicide rate compared to firearm ownership rate. Comparing these two, there is no correlation between cross-sectional firearm ownership rate and intentional homicide rate globally or regionally.\n\n[Here is just something I picked out that illustrates the issue clearly for US states.](https://zachmortensen.net/2013/01/10/gun-control-four-must-see-graphs/) Here\'s one that [also covers the regional and global breakdowns](https://medium.com/@bjcampbell/everybodys-lying-about-the-link-between-gun-ownership-and-homicide-1108ed400be5). Feel free to check the numbers, as they should be publicly available. [Here\'s one that covers OECD standard developed countries and global stats.](http://crimeresearch.org/2014/03/comparing-murder-rates-across-countries/) Here is [a before and after analysis regarding varrious bans.](https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/)\n\nAustralia is frequently cited as an example of successful gun control, but [no research has been able to show conclusively that the Austrailain NFA had any effect](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5103556_The_Australian_Firearms_Buyback_and_Its_Effect_on_Gun_Deaths). In fact, the US saw a similar drop in homicide over similar time frames without enacting significant gun controls. [/u/vegetarianrobots](https://www.reddit.com/u/vegetarianrobots) has a [better writeup on that specific point than I do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/comments/b8xxav/z/ek0s53n)\n\nSimilarly, the UK saw no benefit from gun control enacted throughout the 20th century.\n\n[The UK has historically had a lower homicide rate than even it\'s European neighbors since about the 14th Century.](https://ourworldindata.org/homicides)\n\n[Despite the UK\'s major gun control measures in 1968, 1988, and 1997 homicides generally increased from the 1960s up to the early 2000s.](https://mises.org/wire/gun-control-what-happened-england-ireland-and-canada)\n\n[It wasn\'t until a massive increase in the number of law enforcement officers in the UK that the homicide rates decreased.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/143957/hosb0113.pdf)\n\nNote that I cite overall homicide rates, rather than firearm homicide rates. This is because I presume that you are looking for marginal benefits in outcome. Stabbed to death, beat to death, or shot to death is an equally bad outcome unless you ascribe some irrational extra moral weight to a shooting death. Reducing the firearm homicide rate is not a marginal gain if it is simply replaced by other means, which seems to be the case.\n\nProposed bans on ""Assault Weapons"" intended to ban semi-automatic varrients of military rifles are even more absurd, as [rifles of all sorts are the least commonly used firearm for homicide and one of the least commonly used weapons in general](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2011-2015.xls), losing out to blunt instruments, personal weapons (hands and feet) and knives.\n\nAs for the more active value of the right, [the lowest credible estimates of Defensive gun use are in the range of 55-80k annual total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_use), which is about 16.9-24.5 per 100k, but actual instances are more likely well over 100k annually, or 30.7 per 100k.\n\nAdditionally, there is the historical precedent that every genocide of the 20th century was enacted upon a disarmed population. The Ottomans disarmed the Armenians. The Nazis disarmed the Jews. The USSR and China (nationalists and communists) disarmed everyone. \n\nEvents of this scale are mercifully rare, but are extraordinarily devastating. The modern US, and certainly not Europe are not somehow specially immune from this sort of slaughter except by their people being aware of how they were perpetrated, and they always first establish arms control.\n\nLets examine the moral math on this: [Tyrannical governments killed ~262 million people in the 20th century.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide)\n\nThe US represents ~4.5% of the world population.\n\n.045 × 262,000,000 / 100 = 123,514 murders per year by tyrannical governments on average for a population the size of the US.\n\nConsidering how gun-control (or lack thereof) is statistically essentially uncorrelated with homicide rates, and there were [11,004 murders with firearms](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/violent-crime/tables/table-12) in the US in 2016, the risk assessment ought to conclude that yes, the risk of tyrannical government is well beyond sufficient to justify any (if there are any) additional risk that general firearm ownership could possibly represent.\n\nThe historical evidence of disarmament preceding atrocity indicates that genocidal maniacs generally just don\'t want to deal with an armed population, but can the US population actually resist the federal government, though? Time for more math.\n\nThe US population is ~ 326 million.\n\nConservative estimates of the US gun-owning population is ~ 115 million.\n\nThe entire DOD, including civilian employees and non-combat military is ~2.8 million. Less than half of that number (1.2M) is active military. Less than half of the military is combat ratings, with support ratings/MOSes making up the majority.In a popular insurgency, the people themselves are the support for combat-units of the insurgency, which therefore means that active insurgents are combat units, not generally support units.\n\nSo lets do the math. You have, optimistically, 600,000 federal combat troops vs 1% (1.15 million) of exclusively the gun owning Americans actively engaged in an armed insurgency, with far larger numbers passively or actively supporting said insurgency. \n\nThe military is now outnumbered ~2:1 by a population with small-arms roughly comparable to their own and significant education to manufacture IEDs, hack or interfere with drones, and probably the best average marksmanship of a general population outside of maybe Switzerland. Additionally, this population will have a pool of [19.6 million veterans, including 4.5 million that have served after 9/11](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/Veteran_Population.asp), that are potentially trainers, officers, or NCOs for this force.\n\nThe only major things the insurgents are lacking is armor and air power and proper anti-material weapons. Armor and Air aren\'t necessary, or even desirable, for an insurgency. Anti-material weapons can be imported or captured, with armored units simply not being engaged by any given unit until materials necessary to attack those units are acquired. Close-air like attack helicopters are vulnerable to sufficient volumes of small arms fire and .50 BMG rifles. All air power is vulnerable to sabotage or raids while on the ground for maintenance.\n\nThis is before even before we address the defection rate from the military, which will be >0, or how police and national guard units will respond to the military killing their friends, family, and neighbors. \n\nBasically, a sufficiently large uprising could absolutely murder the military. Every bit of armament the population has necessarily reduces that threshold of ""sufficiently large"". With the raw amount of small arms and people that know how to use them in the US, ""sufficiently large"" isn\'t all that large in relative terms.', 'Because the Constitution says no, and  No Means No. \n\nIf one wants the Constitution to say ""yes,"" there is a mechanism for that to happen and it\'s called an Amendment.', 'Gun Control is a scam aimed at people control. It has been aimed at specific groups of people who were deemed a problem by the powers that be in historic and modern times. In the past it’s goals were not hidden. In our times it falsely hides behind the guise of safety and security.\n\nI have been watching it closely for over 40 years, since they started with Handgun Control Inc. They have a play book that they keep going to over and over again, with minor variations. The end game is the elimination of all civilian gun ownership, which is the only thing that stops them from wholesale implementation of EU style “progressive” government and policies.\n\nThe whole anti-tyranny 2nd Ammendment thing is the only thing that stops them from making the US part of their “world community”, and it drives them nuts. So they will create false crisis and scream, “the children”, “epidemic and scourge”, “reasonable compromise”, and “gun safety”, when the facts dont support it, their laws dont make sense, and they have no intention of compromising.\n\nThey lie to take every inch that gun owners give to make it as difficult as possible to be a law abiding gun owner, and use it as a stepping stone for their next push. They dont care that the laws dont effect criminals, or reduce mass shootings or crime, cause thats not their goal.\n\nThe slippery slope is not a myth. It is a real anti gun/anti freedom strategy.', ""Because I don't trust the government to fairly implement those measures.

After 88 years of this at the federal level and much longer at local levels we\'ve learned to put our foot down and fight EVERY bit of additional regulation.\n\nIf the other side REALLY wanted to compromise maybe we\'d at least entertain some ideas.  Do things like let us buy suppressors without jumping through hoops, or remove short barreled rifles from the NFA, or  allow the manufacturer of fully auto guns again, and maybe we\'ll at least sit at the table and listen to what additional regulation they want to add.

And I think rightfully so, governments are the largest criminal organizations in the world. They fuck up so much and ruin so much, why should we trust them to solve our problems? \n\nThe government hasn’t proven to be trustworthy, good intentioned, or competent at solving most societal problems. They are absolutely none of those things. I have lost all faith in the government, they cause more destruction than good. So I will not give up my right to have a firearm so that the government can have even more control over my life.\n\nThe government doesn’t care about reducing crime, nor care about the people. I think they’ve proven that time and time again.  I simply do not believe they want gun control to reduce crime, they want control and power. I simply do not believe that politicians have good intentions.', ""An exceptionally good example of why civilians need firearms would be the battle of athens in Tennessee. During and directly after world War 2 a party boss took control over the political machines in a few counties in Tennessee using bribery, extortion, blackmail, and some violence and threats in order to secure votes to run for offices. After the war a bunch of veterans came back and realized what he was doing. The FBI wouldn't get involved, so on a voting day the veterans armed up and all worked together to force a fair voting process. The party boss had called in hundreds of corrupt sheriff's deputies from adjacent counties and a firefight eventually ensued, in which the vets forced a surrender of the remaining uncounted ballots and got a fair election which the party boss lost.

Sensible gun regulation,"Why does gun regulation have to be so complicated and controversial? Regulation under 2A could be as simple as this.

10,000 ft/lbs max muzzle energy

10 rounds per magazine

Sem-Automatic

These are the primary factors that affect lethality and ability to do widespread damage. Barrel length doesn't matter. Stock type doesn't matter. Evil features don't matter. Even ammo type itself really doesn't matter that much...

Assuming (a big assumption I know) that the primary reasons for owning a firearm are self-defense and hunting. I cannot conceive of a reason anyone needs more than 10,000 ft/lbs ME. Honestly 5k should be plenty, but maybe there some big-game/long-range type shooters who would complain. Fine, 10k ME is under .50BMG (13k ME) and I think this is a reasonable and commonly accepted limit for what regular citizens should be allowed to own.

10rds per mag should be an acceptable compromise between needing to defend yourself and limiting the ability of bad actors to do widespread damage. Seriously, if you can't defend yourself with 10rds per mag, you are seriously f\*cked anyways. I invite anyone to share REAL scenarios where having more than 10rds/mag would have saved someone's life. And maybe there are some scenarios, I just haven't seen them. I'm genuinely curious.

Semi auto should be considered acceptable. ROF is critical for self-defense, and the number of people that can be injured is more dependant on rds/mag than ROF. If self-defense is considered an acceptable reason to own a firearm, semi-auto must also be allowed by extension.

I would also add that I think exemptions to these rules could/should be allowed with extreme heavy regulatory oversight.

So that's it. Just 3 regulations is all that's needed in my opinion. Thoughts welcome.

"I Know It's a Recycled Question, But Do You All Think We Need More Gun Regulation?","**This would be my first ever Reddit Post, Feel Free to Respond:**

Before I get into my point, I just want everyone to know that I don't think it's entirely wrong for citizens to own a gun.

However, I am one to admit that gun regulation needs to be strengthened in America. The second amendment was formulated centuries ago in fear of a tyrannical government, so our founding fathers felt that our best way to combat this was the use of armed weapons for citizens.

In recent years though, I have come to notice that most instances in which a gun is involved is when there is a situation relating to gang violence, homicides, and mass shootings. These statistics will only increase as the gap between permissive and restrictive gun law states.

In all honesty, gun control needs to be a more talked about subject in America, for the situation at hand is only get more prevalent each and every year. It's only a matter of time before someone that we know or care about gets affected by this**.**

Nobody is going to take our guns away, if that were the case,  I would be with you. Why is it such an atrocity for the government to try and prevent things like this from happening?

If we wait until someone proposes some oppressive regulation scheme to oppose the gun control agenda, it will already be too late. Give the gun controllers an inch and they\'ll take your guns though.\n\nAlso the gun debate is how it is for two reasons:\n\nFirst, guns are a very primal issue. Gun rights supporters see guns as something that can keep them alive in a desperate situation. Taking away guns, or suggesting policy that will lead to the restriction and eventual potentially taking of guns, is an existential threat. Gun control advocates are asking these people to let themselves be killed. Personally, I don\'t intend to be killed because of someone else\'s naive idealism. Meanwhile, many people want restrictions because they don\'t know anything about guns other than how dangerous they are and that guns can kill people. To them, the continued presence of guns in society -- particularly outside the hands of their trusted authority figures -- means more chances for them to get killed. They fear these dangerous things that they don\'t understand, and they would rather ban them than overcome that fear and make an effort to understand.\n\nSecond, the gunphobes are desperate. They couldn\'t get anything passed by exploiting Sandy Hook, which in their eyes should have been America\'s Port Arthur. There will never be such a golden opportunity for them again, and they failed despite mobilizing everything they had to push through every regulation they currently want.

For many, it symbolizes independence and self-reliance: we will protect ourselves and not depend on our government to do it, and we stand ready to menace our government should they ever grow tyrannical (theoretically, anyway -- remember, this is about a symbolic statement). \n\nSo any attempt to control or limit guns, by a kind of symbolic association, feels like an attempt to control or limit **freedom** and **independence**. \n\nEven the staunchest gun advocate cannot ignore that the U. S. alone among the developed nations of the world regularly has mass shootings, and has a homicide rate far higher than other countries of the developed world. The very simple difference is that in the U. S., it is easy to procure a gun, and in most of those countries it is not. Sorry to dash cold water on a lot of half-cocked theories about how civil we'd be if everybody wore a six-shooter on his hip, but obviously if we were to make it hard to purchase guns, we -- like the rest of the world that has done this -- would see fewer mass killings and fewer homicides, for the very simple fact that it's much easier to kill someone with a gun. \n\nBut of course if we were to limit or control guns, we'd lose a part of our uniquely American mythos.

I'm not concerned about too many social issues with them right now. "", '[removed]', '[deleted]', ""> Scheer, himself the parent of five, sends his school-age kids to a Christian school in Regina. That has undoubtedly led to his commitment to make it more attractive for parents to send their kids to religious schools.\n\n> He committed to unveiling an annual tax deduction of $4,000 per child for parents who send their kids to “independent schools,” and another $1,000 per child for those who homeschool their children. (Some tuition for religious schools may already be tax deductible, depending on the school, but Scheer’s policy would create a deduction for all non-public schools.\n\nSo someone like Scheer can pop out 5 kids and get a tax break of a cool $20k to send them to a private school where they'll be taught that having 5 kids and sending them to a private school is the good and Christian thing to do?\n\nHow is this anything other a blatant attempt to choke the government of funds that could go towards things we all benefit from like public schools and a handout to conservative Christians?"", ""Interesting examination of Scheer's policy positions. From the intro:\n\n> Scheer has long been known as a social conservative, but faced little scrutiny in the race, after being left in the shadow of Kevin O’Leary and Maxime Bernier, the two frontrunners with socially progressive records. Thanks to his long tenure as speaker of the House of Commons — and his nominal neutrality in that role — Scheer’s record on the issues is considerably more thin than his competitors.\n\nThe Vice article (by Justin Ling) does a good job of describing some of Scheer's concrete policy proposals. \n\nOn homeschooling:\n\n> how he’d get the federal government involved in education, which is normally a provincial matter.\n\n> ... He committed to unveiling an annual tax deduction of $4,000 per child for parents who send their kids to “independent schools,” and another $1,000 per child for those who homeschool their children. (Some tuition for religious schools may already be tax deductible, depending on the school, but Scheer’s policy would create a deduction for all non-public schools.)\n\nOn climate change:\n\n> Instead of the pricing scheme, Scheer has largely just taken, nearly word-for-word, the Harper government’s plan on reducing CO2 emissions — “a sector by sector approach to reduce greenhouse gases in cooperation with industry and the United States.” It remains unclear exactly what that sector-by-sector approach actually entails.\n\n> Scheer isn’t without any environmental policy, however. His policy page insists he will focus on “real threats” to the environment. The only plan listed is to “make it illegal to dump raw sewage into public waterways.” That may sound like a no-brainer, but it’s exactly what Montreal did in 2015, with the green light from the Trudeau government."", '>will oppose transgender rights\n\nwelp. another long period of not even being able to consider voting conservative. Hard to vote for someone who basically wants to sweep you under a rug because you\'re inconvenient and ""icky"". I will continue to hope for some sort of ... socially Progressive, fiscally Conservative party. ', 'I\'m worried that Scheer used up too much ammo during the leadership campaign by trying to woo SoCons into putting him higher in the ballot. \n\nHe\'s already come out to say he would mimic the anti-intellectual hysteria south of the border of ""defunding"" post-secondary institutions that don\'t ""protect free speech"" (via SSHRC grants LOL)- in fact, I\'m pretty sure in one of the emails he named that right-wing activists in particular were under threat. That in itself is a gigantic pile of dung Scheer gave the Liberals to fling back at him. Can you imagine the attack ads of him being savaged because he cares more about pictures of aborted fetuses being displayed in prime real estate than education and scientific research? Nevermind the explicit partisan nature of his position? Yikes. Even if he backpedals/whitewashes he will get shit from both the left for the sheer idiocy of the idea and from the right because he will have to retreat and he will look weak before his SoCons supporters. \n\nAnd again, fuck. The whole ""real refugees only"" bullshit that\'s just a code for ""only non-Muslim refugees"" on the level of Farage and Le Pen, which is a mantra that somehow became popular within the party (probably courtesy of Ezra Levant). Frankly I don\'t think he can even gloss over this one because a lot of people within the party genuinely think Canada should be screening refugees for religion. Again, barring a France-level string of ISIS attacks that somewhat vindicates Scheer I don\'t see how he doesn\'t get his asshole torn on this point either. \n\nThen overt battles over gun regulations will never end well, even if the Tories are generally right on this front. There was so much gnashing of teeth over Harper scrapping the long gun registry, a bunch of money was saved, gun rights were enhanced and no mad man was emboldened. Canada doesn\'t have American gun culture; few people see it as either a necessity or a right. Trying to convince the public rural Westerners need their AR-15\'s to shoot faster at meth heads and status Indians won\'t end well. Best to keep the gun classification debate among experts and lawmakers. \n\nNot too sure how the homeschooling stuff will pan out in political discourse, but nearly all Tories oppose C-16 so that\'s hardly a Scheer or SoCon special.\n\n\ntl;dr hard to keep the ""divisive policies"" away when you won the leadership by paying lip service to them.', ""I'm not super into picking fights with transgendered people but I have no problems with the other two.

Personally, I believe a dedicated, intelligent parent is more then capable of schooling their child when they have the right resources. Unfortunately, the people who tend to homeschool are religious nutbars that just don't want their children learning about things they don't like.

The range would have an on-site psychologist to check with you before you shoot (this is mainly to prevent suicides, as male suicides via handguns are very high), and after getting a gun safety briefing as well as a how-to shoot tutorial for your firearm, you could shoot whatever gun you wanted at the range.\n\nThis would essentially be the safest, easiest way to still have access to all types of firearms, while still preventing gun violence and suicides. \n\nBest of all?

"As a lifelong lefty, this is my idea for gun-regulation","Basically set up private liability insurance companies. In order to buy and own a gun, you need to have insurance. In the event your gun is used in a crime or is stolen, the insurance company would be held liable for any and all damages. Regarding privacy, the government would have access to the insurance companies, and know which guns they are insuring, but not which individuals. In the event of a gun being used in a crime, or a search/arrest warrant being applied to the individual, the insurance company must report the identity and firearms owned by the individual.

I think that the insurance company would need to be publicly transparent on how they insure 2 things:

1. Are you competent with a dangerous piece of the dangerous piece of equipment (think of this like a heavy machinery operator providing proof of competence). This could be done with either military or police background, or a short gun safety class.

2. Are you mentally stable? If it were me running a company I would do 3 things: (1) an anonymous 1 hour video call with a licensed psychiatrist for you, and your kids. (2) 3 longtime close friends or family members willing to speak for your mental health. (3) a thorough criminal background check, and especially for young men calling old teachers and school counselors.

Why would this work?

I empathize with the conservative skepticism regarding being on a government list. So I think that having the third party insurance company, which, by law couldn't provide your identity unless you or your weapon are involved in a crime; is a relatively simple common ground.

Doing this from an insurance perspective, means that if you own 1 or 2 guns for hunting, and a couple for self defense, you have a family and are sane, you would probably pay a very low rate. Second it doesn't take an actuarial savant to find the high risk group: young, socially isolated, violent men, with a history of mental illness. 

And I think its important to realize (both democrats and republicans) we don't need an insanely fine net. I think if anyone were to have a 5 minute conversation with one of these mass shooters, they could easily tell that person isn't mentally fit to own a gun. The majority of gun violence is done by people with a history of violence, and by (for the most part) obviously crazy people.

Another good point is there wouldn't have to be a weapon ban, but like cars if you own an extended mag AR-15, or a suped up porsche. You would need to either pay more for insurance or give more evidence of your mental fitness.

If it ends up costing a lot, you could subsidize it with an ammo and heavy, high capacity arms tax. Which would offload the cost from simple hunters and people concerned about self defense, to the people who can afford to buy arsenals and shoot up a hillside every weekend.

Let me know if you think this is a healthy middle ground, or where you think it goes to far.

I mean I’ll go out and say that I don’t think anyone is going to willingly pay more money, take more classes, and get on a list that (let’s be honest) will be abused. Additionally they’ve already had to do at least 2/3 of these things provided their weapons are purchased legally. So it kind of seems like  it would punish the people who wanted weapons (for whatever purpose) legally and make an untaxed/uninsured black market far more appealing. Why should working families who enjoy making brass piles on the weekend have to dole out further money in a way to preserve the freedom they already enjoy? I believe it would create a complex system of loopholes, illegal untaxed markets, and probably make it easier to score unregistered firearms. Also enforceability might be a moot point if the current law abiding citizens aren’t going along with this plan and the local authorities don’t want to enforce it.

Most gun owners already need permits, and are already on government lists.\n\nG. Yes, you can fairly easily make a law that tells insurance companies when they insure a gun, they are responsible for the damages caused by that gun. Health insurance isn't a fair comparison (my mom is a higher up at a pharmacy college), the scale and complexity of modern medicine, and privately owned firearms, are orders of magnitude different. The better parallel is car insurance. Which again car liability insurance is already a thing and fairly well run.

Currently there is no reasonable way for me to tell.  \n\nThe key to it being voluntary is Enforcement.

I'm partial to the method Switzerland uses - you go to the Post Office and get a certificate from the government that says you're not an asshole. You show it to sellers who have a verification number they can call to ensure its authenticity. Background check is done. There's no registry here, there's no fees, there's not even a requirement to drive a hundred miles to some gun store and do it. *I* don't want to sell a gun to a criminal, but I sure as shit shouldn't have to feel punished to prove it.\n\n3) A national registry... of stolen guns! Just like #2, I don't want to provide a gun to a criminal... but I also don't want to buy a stolen gun. A simple system that allows people to check if a gun they're buying is stolen. No names are collected, just a basic database search.\n\n4) Regulation on machine guns through the National Firearms Act (albeit with the registry open). While a lot of pro-gun hardcore people want them totally  unregulated, I think it serves us far better politically to allow people to be assured that scary-wary machine guns are 'regulated' or 'banned' or whatever. If a $200 tax stamp is what it takes to get people to not scream about AR15 machine guns, I'll deal with it. All the rest of the shit on the NFA though? Get that out of there. A fucking foregrip on a Glock isn't worth regulating.\n\n5) National concealed carry with an NRA training course. Again where I differ from some pro-gun absolutists, I'm against 'Constitutional Carry'. And really my reasons for being okay with a training course are similar to the machine gun thing: our rights in general are going to be better protected by being able to tell people that 'yes, concealed carriers are trained' versus 'anyone with a gun can carry anywhere'. Unlike most gun laws though, there is one bright side to this - I think that that training *would* serve as a net benefit to the concealed carrier.\n\n6) Allow citizens to volunteer for a more thorough government inspection and licensing system in exchange for much more permissive access to firearms. I can already pay $30 and get a C&R license that has guns shipped right to my doorstop... I can buy a 1911 from the 50s, but I can't buy a 1911 from 2014? Why not?

People are too afraid to look at data and point out obvious conclusions for fear of being labeled a racist, bigoted, ignorant, or whatever. They\'re even more afraid to act on that data for fear of the same.\n\nGun violence is predominantly committed by black males. The victims are primarily black males. Many of these cases, if not most, are incidents of unsavory characters shooting each other. Shootings like San Bernadino are barely a blip on the radar in the total body count, yet they receive a vastly disproportionate amount of the news media\'s attention.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/19/the-racial-divide-in-americas-gun-deaths/ - Data.\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/01/15/opinion/frum-guns-race/ - Data plus some rambling.\n\nOh my god, RACISM! The facts are the facts. Some will quickly point out the connection to poverty and I absolutely agree, poverty is likely a large, if not the largest, driving force behind these crimes. It\'s not a problem of race so much as it is a problem of statistics - blacks are significantly more likely to be poor thus are significantly more likely to commit crimes. I\'m sure there\'s other factors at play that the SJW and BLM crowds would happily point out in an effort to label any attempt at this kind of discussion to be racist and its participants to be worse than Hitler.\n\nHere\'s the problem, all these excuses and circle jerks aren\'t going to save lives. Congratulatory self-pats on the back by some 25 year old sitting in his mom\'s basement in middle class suburbia might help him sleep well at night, but it\'s not doing a damn thing for people stuck in the epicenter of the violence. Droning on and on about privilege and cultural appropriation isn\'t going to lower the body count.\n\nRather than ask the tough question of ""why the hell are black guys killing each other?"" politicians pass  ineffective feel good measures that solve a problem that really doesn\'t exist. Could closing the ""gun show loophole"" prevent some gun violence? Possibly, but I\'m not sure you\'d ever see any statistical significance in the body count from doing so. Similarly, banning certain guns solely based on looks isn\'t going to save a single person. The types of guns most often being banned on looks (predominantly rifles, especially AK style) are extremely unlikely to be used in shootings. But politicians pass these kinds of laws, make some speech about it, and their supporters continue to vote for them for being ""tough"" on gun violence while the people who responsibly enjoy shooting as a hobby or sport bear the brunt of these laws.\n\nWhen politicians start questioning this ludicrous failure that has been the war on drugs I\'ll start listening to their gun control proposals. When they start talking about how the cycle of poverty and prison has entrapped so many people and seemingly created a culture around it, then maybe something can happen. But that day isn\'t here, yet. Today we\'re still focused on the gun show loophole. And grips. And suppressors. Today we\'re focused on superficial efforts that serve nobody but politicians\' bids to get elected.', ""Find me a policy that will actually reduce the murder rate and I'll look into it. Gun control laws are good at reducing the use of guns in crime, but [don't reduce the murder rate](http://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol.asp#crime_dc). That means that a) criminals are turning to other weapons in the fact of stricter gun regulation, and b) those weapons are being used just as lethally as guns, since a higher survival rate would reduce the overall murder rate while increasing the number of assaults on record.\n\nI'm personally a fan of proven, effective programs [like Ceasefire, which Obama and other gun control advocates refuse to help fund](https://newrepublic.com/article/124445/beyond-gun-control), despite cities with gang violence desperately needing assistance with them.

The point being, is the ship for reasonable and sensible gun control sailed a long time ago.  \n\nAs for dealing with actual gun violence in this country there are 3 main things that need to be solved. Gang violence, suicides, and mass shootings. \n\nStarting with gang violence I do think a program like cease-fire would help at-risk youth realize what they're doing when it comes to joining a gang or other potentially deadly behaviors. I'm by no means an expert when it comes to dealing with disadvantaged youth but anything that helps them stay in school and become productive members of society would be a huge factor. \n\nSuicides are a much tougher problem simply because we don't understand mental illness like we do physical illnesses and this will be by far the hardest problem to solve. I think that the best approach would be two fold between educating the public and research. I think a really cool idea for education would be offering training to FFLs on how to evaluate someone's true intensions of buying a weapon or figuring out their true mental state. AFAIK all state allow gun store owners to reject gun sales for any reason and mental health education could be a valuable tool.  \n\nMass shootings are also a tricky problem to solve. They're really hard to predict and gun control doesn't really help. Yes the sandy hook shooter's mother purchased those weapons legally but the killer murdered his own mother and stole them.... Also in San Bernardino those weapons were purchased legally however those weapons were transferred to the suspects without going through California's mandated private sales background check. \nHonestly the best defense for mass shootings is better security. We protect heads of states, VIPs, nuclear power plants, military bases, banks, corporate trade secrets, and a lot more with armed guards/ police. Why not schools?

Now when people say that, what they REALLY mean is ""Guns should be regulated like cars, in addition to how they\'re regulated now."" That\'s because the pro-gun crowd would LOVE if guns were treated like cars. After all, here\'s a list of what the reverse would be like; if cars were regulated like guns.\n\n- ~~Suppressors~~ Mufflers are banned, because someone hard-of-hearing could get hit by a car they couldn\'t hear. Getting a muffler installed (which is outright illegal in many states) requires permission from your local chief of police, requires you to submit to a driving records inspection and background check which takes on average about nine months, you have to pay $200 in taxes to have it done, and only YOU can drive the modified vehicle from that point on. Furthermore, it\'s illegal to keep the car in an unsecured location, and taking it beyond state lines requires explicit permission from the federal government, and you have to tell them exactly where and how long you\'ll have it out of state. And you have to drive around any state that doesn\'t allow them.\n\n- Cars with exceptionally ~~short barrels~~ low clearance, ~~pistols with foregrips~~ long wheelbases, and other random criteria are also regulated like that.\n\n- All cars require a constant pushing and releasing action on the ~~trigger~~ gas pedal to maintain speed. Any car that sustains speed by constant pressure on the gas, or have devices that sustain speed, are considered \'~~machine guns~~ autocars\'. Autocars are controlled like the above, but more to the point, no autocar made after 1986 is allowed to be bought by any individual in the entire country. Ever. The small number of transferrable autocars still able to be bought have markup prices of roughly 1,200-25,000%.\n\n- If you are under 21, the only vehicle you can buy from a dealership is a ~~long gun~~ minivan. Only when you are 21 are you allowed to buy a ~~handgun~~ sedan-sized car (or smaller).\n\n- Exceptionally small cars, like the ~~Walther PPK~~ SmartCar, are considered \'~~Saturday Night Specials!~~ Sunday Evening Specials\' and banned. Cars have to meet minimum sizes in dimensions.\n\n- A handful of cars deemed particularly scary, like the ~~Franchi SPAS-12~~ Honda Civic, are expressly banned from importation or sale as a \'~~destructive~~ racing device\'.\n\n- In several states, cars with \'~~assault features~~ racing features\' are banned. Such \'racing features\' include: ~~adjustable stocks~~ adjustable seats, ~~pistol grips~~ spoilers, ~~ability to take 30-round magazines~~ ability to accept turbochargers, designed to use gas over 89 octane, and carbon fiber bodywork. Even if you own one of these cars from another state where it\'s legal, you cannot drive it into any of these other states, even for a moment.\n\n- Any driving infraction is punished by forfeiture of your car and car-owning privileges for effectively forever.\n\n- Due to the risk of hitting kids with your car, you are not allowed to drive a car on any school or campus property in most states.\n\n- In Washington state, a recent law called ~~I-594~~ R-UFKNDUM made it illegal for you to let anyone drive your car unless you and your friend go down to the DMV and process a title change and do a background check on his driving history. When he\'s done with your car, you have to go back and do it over again. It also makes it illegal for museums to display antique cars that are on loan from private owners, and illegal for a man to hand his car over to his own father when he offers to clean it.\n\n- In Maryland, getting your driver\'s license altogether requires personal permission from the local chief of police. He is allowed to deny you for any reason whatsoever, even based on the color of your skin. You also have to justify an urgent need to drive, and \'casual use\' which could be accomplished with a bicycle is not recognized as a valid reason.\n\n- In Southern California, there are almost no cars on the road whatsoever. The only cars you see that got permission all happen to be politicians, the famous, rich, and wealthy. \n\n- In New York, any cars you get from inheritance have 30 days to be transferred to a legal licensee-holder. However, it takes a minimum of 90 days for the government to get you a license. \n\n- By executive order, the president has banned ~~Korean M1 Garands~~ Hyundai cars from being imported into the United States. No rational explanation was given for this whatsoever. The only two things of note is that this happened immediately after a presidential anti-car bill failed in Congress, and that the sale of affordable Hyundais help fund the Civilian ~~Marksmanship~~ Drivers\' Program, an organization dedicated to encouraging safe ~~gun~~ car operation, responsible use and training, and competition.\n\n- Any cars from foreign manufacturers must meet import restrictions based on a \'point\' system. Cars that don\'t meet enough \'points\' are declared not for \'~~sporting~~ commuting purpose\' and are banned. Such points include ridiculous criteria like the number of people it can hold, how the doors open, and whether it has mechanical or electrical windows. However, cars made domestically don\'t have to comply with this law.\n\n- If you have a foreign-made car, you have to maintain a certain number of American-made components in it. Only certain components count, and going below the threshold is a 10 year / $100k fine penalty. Interestingly, where the ~~magazines~~ gas you put in originally comes from counts as a \'part\'.', '[deleted]', 'I believe currently, we have more than enough ""gun control laws"". I mean sure you have certain groups that want it to be harder to own a gun. And that only makes it harder on the law abiding citizens. \n\nHell there are probably a few places in town I could take 500 bucks to and come back with a gun that doesn\'t even have serial numbers on it.\n\nThen general argument from gun control advocates is that more laws reduce gun crimes, when actually in certain areas, rates go up.\n\nI will offer as food for thought however, a city in Georgia by the name of Kennesaw. Each home owner of this city is required by law to own a gun (and by required I mean, as long as it does not infringe on your religious or moral beliefs. So basically you are required to own a gun as a home owner..........unless you don\'t want to) \nI can\'t offer the exact number and I\'m on my phone so I can pull the source. But there have been less than 5 murders in roughly 20 years in this town which is a suburb of Atlanta.\n\nI would be interested to see if anyone has heard of results like this in a city where gun laws have been made more strict to reduce crime.\n', ""Basically I don't think we can punish people for not doing a crime but just because we're scared they will do it. Take that logic to cars and you'd be locking up everyone because they might cause a fatal car crash one day, which is a **lot** more likely than a fatal gun accident. \n\nPeople have a skewed perception of the dangers out there, because \n\n1) A gun is specifically made as a weapon people assume it's more dangerous than something made as a form of transportation. \n\n2) Deaths by gun get a lot more media coverage than deaths by car.\n\nLaws against guns is never what causes people to have guns or not, the demand in guns in what causes this. The reason practically nobody has guns here in the Netherlands is not because we once wrote a law saying you can't have them, it's because there wasn't a demand for them in the first place. If ISIS would be knocking on our doors and the demand would rise it's bye-bye law and we'd change it to fit reality.\n\nWe can't let paranoia run a country and give up human rights for a false sense of security."", 'In my opinion no new gun control is needed, but enforcement is needed. The only changes to current regulation would be sentencing related or maybe mandatory jail time.

"", 'Any amount of regulation that if applied to the 1st Amendment there were no problems. ', 'In some ways, I\'m okay with stronger regulations than we have now, although I would probably call it more consistent regulations. I think you should have to get a license to own a gun, just like you have to get a license to drive a car. Getting the license would involve some brief training in gun safetay and also firearm laws. Then, whenever you buy a gun, you just show your license instead of having to jump through a bunch of hoops every single time. \n\nIn other ways, I\'m for way looser regulations than we have now. For starters, concealed carry should be automatic if you\'re able to own a gun. Also, ""gun-free"" zones should be basically eliminated. The only places where you shouldn\'t be able to legally carry a gun should be places that can actually keep guns out, which means metal detectors, guards, etc. Aside from that, anywhere a criminal can take a gun, a law-abiding citizen should be able to take a gun as well.', 'I come at this from a different angle than most.  To me, the wording of the second amendment is clear: ""...the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""  Say whatever you will about the reasons why that statement is written in the constitution (\'well regulated militia, etc etc\'), the fact is that the right is very clearly expressed - congress is not to make any law whatsoever infringing the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\n\nSo long as the second amendment stands, I am against any form of gun control whatsoever.  Yes, including private ownership of aircraft carriers, F16s, nuclear missiles - I don\'t care.  The law is clear.\n\nHowever, the law is also stupid.  \n\nI\'m in favor of an amendment to effectively repeal the second amendment and allow for gun control legislation at the federal level.  At that point I\'d like to see a vigorous debate about what sort of society we want to be with respect to gun ownership.  I\'d vote for representatives who support a total ban on all private ownership of firearms, personally.  But I want to see all opinions expressed in a healthy public debate.  This shouldn\'t be a matter for unelected judges to decide.', ""In Canada, I like the licensing system. It ensures people only competent in handling firearms can do so, as well as passed mental health checks. It also acts as a background check done by the RCMP every day so as long as it's not revoked, I'm a-ok in the eyes of the law. \n\nIt's the ridiculously convoluted Canadian regulations that get me. But that's a post for another day because it's not a fun post to write. They're nearly as bad as California's. "", ""I honestly don't think gun violence is really that big of an issue.

Not too many.\n\nI don't own a gun, am liberal, and live in southern california but I think all the minutia on gun control is stupid. Such a tiny fraction of the population uses LEGAL guns for harm I think it's pretty ridiculous to put law after law on the books-- or try anyway. We liberals have a blind spot for this and don't look at the hard data and try to be too PC and blame something instead of really looking at the issue. We don't seem to care about 90% of the gun violence that just takes place between criminals in gangs in places like chicago and oakland (and ironically san bernardino) and focus instead on the 10% of gun violence that's the result of crazy people and terrorists. If we wanted to stop gun death we'd focus on the criminals, not the insane/terrorists. But we don't, because it's a better story, or there's less poor black people involved. Not really sure why CNN does it.\n\nI'm for background checks, mental health checks (not sure how to do it yet, but hopefully someone can figure it out because most gun deaths in the united states are actually from suicide not murder), and maybe closing the gun show loophole (there should be like a bluebook value for guns and people just have to sell them to a authorized dealer or the government) but other than that I don't think it's really an issue.

Then again mentally ill people can hurt other using weapons other than guns, look at knife violence.\n\nWhat we have is a mental health problem masquerading as a gun problem. ', '  Good luck with this question. I am glad you are asking it and I\'m glad to see it so high up.\n\n\n  But every time I\'ve asked something similar, I\'m surprised and saddened at how there is no common ground (and little civility) between gun enthusiasts and gun-safety advocates on any issues.\n\n\n  For example, on the meaning of the Second Amendment. It seems gun enthusiasts believe the plain meaning and words of the ""well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State"" part is meaningless or unreliable. Gun enthusiasts, along with Justice Scalia (holder of interesting views on education as of late), seem to believe ""militia"" really means whatever you want it to mean, including angry loners with rifles and handgun, bros in Durangos, you name it.  And this is even though the word ""militia"" seems -- at least to the untrained eye -- to have a pretty current and specific meaning that excludes those guys. Heck, we even have militias today, as in the armed services and the National Guard.\n\n\n  And ""security of a free State"" apparently means guns must be so readily available that criminals, terrorists, and mentally-ill people all can easily get and use them. And law-abiding citizens can have them and carry them around, even though, like all of us, those citizens are subject to emotions and can become enraged like the best of us and, in a moment\'s passion, turn an awkward or tense exchange into an irrevocable tragedy. And gun owners openly carrying have a right to intimidate anyone and make everyone else feel (and *be*) less secure. \n\n\n  Yet as confused as the framers might have been about the first part of the 2nd Amendment, they somehow meant *exactly* what they wrote when they came to the ""shall not be infringed"" part. No other amendment is interpreted as absolutely as those words. \n\n\n  The First Amendment, despite its strong free-speech protections, still won\'t let you falsely yell ""fire!"" in a crowded theatre. It won\'t let you use words to solicit, aid, or abet a crime. It won\'t let you slander or defame someone. It won\'t let you commit treason or reveal trade or national security secrets. It won\'t let you plagiarize. It won\'t let you threaten or intimidate someone (which apparently gun enthusiasts think the 2nd amendment lets you do). The list goes on.  And even for ""protected"" speech, we still regularly limit its time, place and manner. We require permits for giving speeches in parks, etc. We ban sound trucks in residential areas in the middle of the night. The same goes for the exercise of religion. The first amendment\'s protections of religion won\'t let you break laws, including, for example, drug laws, even if taking drugs is part of your religion\'s ritual. \n\n\n  The Constitution -- along with its amendments -- always have required *interpretation.* \n\n\n  That\'s why we have federal courts and especially the U.S. Supreme Court.  And even the Supreme Court\'s pro-gun Heller decision recognized that gun regulation is not automatically inconsistent with the Second Amendment. Indeed, today\'s debate isn\'t about what\'s constitutional, it\'s about what lawmakers have the guts to vote for. The interpretation of constitutional protections ALWAYS has required balancing. (Someday, check out the Supreme Court\'s 1938 decision in the Carolene Products case, footnote four, which expressly discusses the type of balancing that must be done in scrutinizing laws for possible constitutional conflicts.)\n\n\n  This is all to say, that this entire debate is incredibly frustrating. Not only is there no common understanding of the Second Amendment, but no one can even agree on the fact and circumstances of gun use and purchases and  statistics of gun injuries and deaths, frequency of mass shootings, etc. etc.\n\n\nAnd now to get down-voted into oblivion. . . so long!', ""As a matter of fact, I think the present level of regulation on guns is entirely too much for my liking, and I'm not particularly interested in discussing any new gun laws unless Democrats are willing to come to the table with some gun laws they'd be willing to give up.\n\nEDIT:  What about making the NICS database... a public blockchain?"", ""Until the ban on automatic and sbrs is revoked I can't support any regulation.

For example, gun locks and gun safes. Those are critical steps in making sure guns are not stolen and accidents don\'t happen. However, people don\'t talk about this that often; more people talk about banning ""assault weapons"" and things like that. An acceptable level of control would be background checks for ALL gun sales, online and from brick and mortar. The only problem is, when do you decide to not sell the person the gun? If somebody had a minor, albeit criminal charge such as possession of drugs, do you choose to not sell them the gun if you are the vendor? If somebody had been caught smoking weed a few months/years back, do you deny them the right to bear arms? Where do you draw the line? I also believe that there should be mandatory licenses for all gun owners and training of some sort for civilians that puts emphasis on safe gun storage and whatnot. For those trying to get a carry permit, I believe there should be training that puts emphasis on conflict resolution and safe gun use (when and when not to display a gun, etc.) and a written exam similar to a driving test.

If either of those happen, allow the patient to place all guns into a certified storage area where the gun may be kept up to a year before being signed over a relative by the doctor. If the patient’s course of medication ends and they end up back to normal - allow them to get their guns back directly. If the psychological problems have persisted, then a relative may accept their guns if they have a way to store them safely.

It’s like asking how to reduce drunk driving deaths without changing anything.', 'Fix every single other societal issue except for the obvious one', 'all guns mush have a trigger lock. all guns must be locked in a safe. guns can not be stored loaded. all ammo must be locked in a separate safe. safes must have alarms and or notifications when opened. that way if someone wants to do a shooting they have 3 separate locks that must be opened and the gun then needs to be loaded. you can add that all guns must have fingerprint locks for extra safety that way the only person that can fire the gun is the owner. owners must be 100% responsible for their guns at all times. so if a child takes the gun to school for a shooting the parent is legally liable in all aspects (the parent gets charged with 17 murders).', 'So...  how do we deal with a problem, without dealing with the problem.  \n\n\nOther than that, the gov\'t should go on as it has been - bemoaning the loss of life and offering ""thoughts and prayers"" every time it happens.', 'When your kid shoots up a mall, you get charged for the crime.', 'Gun safety courses. A impactful change on our public healthcare which includes mental health.\n\nMore school funding, policy changes on bullying. \n\nReally it just comes down to letting schools give a fuck about the students rather than treating them all like a number and having standardized everything.', 'I think better recognition of troubled children within school systems, outreach programs for students that isolate themselves or are isolated by peers would be beneficial.', ""I would suggest a couple of possible solutions: \n\nFirst, definitely improve mental health programs. In the United States, mental health is somewhat regarded as a negative thing. If areas such as school guidance and psychology is given better programs to help accommodate their students, it would be better for everyone altogether.\n\nSecondly, if the threat of Mass Shootings is still prevalent, it may be time for places to consider creating a budget for a better security system. I think it would be hugely beneficial for better security measures to be taken at all public schools first, then move towards security in other public locations as well. \n\nThe second point isn't largely preferable as many who carry firearms on them in public carry them with the intent of defending themselves and others around them."", 'I think we can better enforce existing criminal statutes and more harshly punish violent criminals.  \n\nMaybe if we got away from the ""don\'t talk about the shooter"" idealogy and really got into why the shooter did what he did and what warning signs were missed or ignored, more people would report those signs and pay attention to future potential shooters.  \n\nI also think we need to pay more attention to the victims of these shootings and the impact violent crime has on their lives.  Change the victims from faceless statistics back to real people with lives and families that are destroyed because of a shooter.  Maybe then people would be more sympathetic.  Now we\'re getting kind of desensitized to extreme violence.  They get barely a mention on the news because we ""don\'t want to glorify the shooter.""  \n\nMaybe we should pay more attention to the victims and the circumstances that lead to the shooting?', ""If there were better mental health resources for those in need, it would help the situation a lot. also parents can be more responsible (not that its thier fault) in locking guns away safely and taking advantage of trigger locks and such. Also education on how a gun works and how a bullet works and gun safety can also help. Unfortunately as long as guns are in America (virtually impossible to remove them) its impossible to fully get rid of the threat. If there wore no guns it wouldn't stop the violence. People will resort to other methods such as homemade bombs, school stabbings etc. It's 95% a mental health issue"", 'Mental health, as everyone else is saying, needs to be accessible and destigmatized. I would add:\n\nCreating a decent standard of living, through regulations, or even direct government action (UBI).\n\nUniversal healthcare\n\nDecriminalization of vices (drugs and sex work primarily)\n\nFederal standards for all law enforcement that include a ""duty to protect""\n\nAn age limit of 21 for all semi automatic weapons\n\nProsecute domestic violence charges as domestic violence (no plea bargaining down to misdemeanor assault), AND universal loss of gun rights for those convicted. Ditto for animal abusers.\n\nSome aspects of red flag laws could be useful, if protections are put in place to prevent abuse. Also, the suspension of one\'s gun rights without a trial must be a short term solution only, after which rights are restored and property returned.\n\nNormalize and encourage daily carrying for those who are able. If 30% of all adults are armed everywhere, a mass shooter will likely do less harm before begin neutralized. There is a reason mass shootings tend to happen where armed individuals are uncommon.\n\nThis also leads to my most important point. We must work to eliminate toxic masculinity, ESPECIALLY in gun culture. This idea that expressing your power through violence, I believe, is a huge contributor to those mass shootings that could be prevented. And the symbol of the gun as an expression of power over others contributes to that problem. Guns are tools for the preservation of life and liberty, and should be viewed as such. They should NOT be portrayed as a means to dominate others. That should always be viewed as a tragic misuse of the tool.\n\nI can elaborate on any of these points if anyone asks.', 'Zero media attention. Problem solved.', 'require firearm safety classes in high school, show that a fire arm is just as useful as any other tool.  Better yet have veterans teach the class, they have they have some of the most experience and it will help with the jobless/homeless veteran rate.', 'Enforce the current laws more effectively', 'Mental health', 'stop the media from sensationalizing something that is a relatively small issue and making it seem like its a massive problem that we should live in fear over.  when 4 people get shot in a mall 2000 miles away, we dont need nonstop breaking coverage and analitics and debates and 4 days of coverage.\n\nwe dont have a mass shooting problem.  we have a media problem.  \n\nwe also need more mental health care.  free mental health care.  well, to be more specific, free health care that also includes mental health care.\n\nfeel helpless in life and want to make a statement?  a mass shooting is the only sure fire way to be known and heard.  take away the guns and you wont eliminate the desire to be known and heard via the news... youll just replace the guns with something else... like bombs, etc.', ""De-stigmatize open carry in public places . I know this sounds insane but there is a method to the madness, and there are advantages that open carry offers that concealed carry doesn't.\n\nFirst, it is a much more effective deterrent to would-be criminals than a concealed weapon will ever be, for obvious reasons. You can actually *see* the weapon.\n\nSecondly, in the case that the criminal is not deterred and you actually need to use the gun, you will generally have a much faster draw time with an open carry holster than you would with concealed carry, which is a good thing in a situation where every second counts.\n\nNow, I will admit that we need to tread carefully. We need to de-stigmatize open carrying in public places, and I think a big part of that is education. Most people tend to fear the unfamiliar and things they can't understand. There needs to be some kind of program that will familiarize non-gun owners with guns so that less people will feel the need to immediately call the police when they see an armed guy walk into a grocery store.\n\nWe also need to improve our mental healthcare, like others here have suggested, and also brush up on background checks and training for people who do own guns. That way we can reduce the likelihood of innocent people dying because the gun owner is mentally unstable or negligent.""]"

Lol.\n\n“Well regulated” in that 18th century context was more of a description of the readiness of the people’s ability to form a militia  - rather than a required condition upon firearms ownership.\n\nI’m not saying thats an argument against any form of restrictions - merely that a lot of people interpret the wording of the 2nd amendment incorrectly.', 'Because in the 1970s the NRA changed from being a sportsman’s organization with a strong emphasis on responsible gun ownership and safety into a culture war organization whose management made a ton of money tying itself to the southern strategy.\n\nSame as how abortion was never a very big issue and was mostly something Catholics who voted mostly for Democrats cared about into a huge portion of the Christian conservative ideology.', ""We all know it has nothing to do with defending against psychotic bears, the odd blood crazed Sasquatch, Indians defending themselves (or not), or even crazy drunken murderous neighbors back in 1780.   \nThe well regulated militia mentioned on the 2nd amendment refers to ppl who get called in during a national emergency; they're the ol' timey version of the National Guard - and NOT ppl living off the land and being pioneers and shit up in the mountains and wildernesses of the then “unexplored” expanses of the U.S."", '“well regulated” sounds like “gun control”', ""14ish years ago the supreme court affirmed (5/4) individuals' right to bear arms independent of service in a state militia.

The first part is merely stating why it is important.\n\nOne thing I had thought about digging into further is the incorporation of the bill of rights. My understanding is that the bill of rights was not a limit on the states at all until the 13th-15th amendments.  So it could be argued that the 2nd amendment wasn\'t meant to stop states from passing gun reform laws, but it changed due to the incorporation of the bill of rights.

With ratification in serious doubt, Federalists announced a willingness to take up the matter of  a series of amendments, to be called the Bill of Rights, soon after ratification and the First Congress  comes into session.  The concession was  undoubtedly  necessary to secure the Constitution\'s hard-fought ratification.  Thomas Jefferson, who did not attend the Constitutional Convention, in a December 1787 letter to Madison called the omission of a Bill of Rights a major mistake: ""A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth.""](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/billofrightsintro.html)\n \nIn Madison\'s own words:\n \n[“I think we should obtain the confidence of our fellow citizens, in proportion as we fortify the rights of the people against the encroachments of the government,” Madison said in his address to Congress in June 1789.](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/on-this-day-james-madison-introduces-the-bill-of-rights)\n \nMadison\'s first draft of the second Amendment is even more clear.\n \n[""The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.""](https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=001/llac001.db&recNum=227)\n \n[*""Mr. Gerry -- This declaration of rights, I take it, is intended to secure the people against the maladministration of the Government; if we could suppose that, in all cases, the rights of the people would be attended to, the occasion for guards of this kind would be removed.

Cruikshank, Presser v. Illinois, DC v. Heller, and even the Dredd Scott decision specifically call out the individual right to keep and bear arms unconnected to militia service.\n \nGun ownership is exactly like every other right, \'need\' does not apply.\n \nBesides doesn’t it really come down to the “shall not be infringed”? There’s already a huge disparity in the words constituting the 2nd Amendment versus how it is applied in practice (especially depending on the state you live in). How many restrictions and qualifications can you place on a right until it is no longer truly a right? \n \nAccording to the US Supreme Court it is unconstitutional to :\n \n-Require a precondition on the exercising of a right. (Guinn v US 1915, Lane v Wilson 1939)\n \n-Require a license (government permission) to exercise a right. (Murdock v PA 1943, Lowell v City of Griffin 1939, Freedman v MD 1965, Near v MN 1931, Miranda v AZ 1966)\n \n-Delay the exercising of a right.

Georgia in 1846 is close enough for the intent of the founding fathers.*\n \n>Nor is the right involved in this discussion less comprehensive or valuable: ""The right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed."" The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, reestablished by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!\n \nWeapons secure all of our rights.

Alcohol is a drug and is regulated relatively effectively.  Sure, minors still drink, but we have laws prohibiting sales to minors and it's illegal to buy for someone.  Regulating other recreational drugs the same way would, in theory, 1) reduce the forbidden fruit temptation, 2) produce legitimate business & tax revenues, 3) ensure a certain purity of product (people will be much less likely to buy a bag of laundry detergent from some unscrupulous dealer who told them it's coke), and 4) reduce gang / cartel sales and drug-related violence.\n\nThe best part about all of this is if we take these measures and they fail catastrophically, we can just repeal them.  We did it for alcohol prohibition, after all.

"Historically, why did conservatives fall on the side of supporting gun rights and liberals fall on the side of supporting gun regulation?","If gun rights are viewed as a civil rights issue, then it seems that liberals should have fallen on the side of supporting them, as they do with recreational drug use and other social/civil issues.

If gun regulations seen as fostering public safety, it seems that conservatives should want increased regulation to keep government authority in place and to better protect citizens as with other defense/safety issues.

Is there som historical reason for why each side settled on their stance?

I’ve seen the idea that conservatives tend to be more rural and more culturally familiar with guns than urban liberals, so maybe that explains the phenomenon?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.",7zjtmr,35,181,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/7zjtmr/historically_why_did_conservatives_fall_on_the/,"[""I think it's the rural / urban identity of each group that has lead to this divide.\n\nYou mention that rural Americans tend to be more culturally familiar with guns, which I think is true, but while urban Americans are (generally) less likely to own guns, they also live with a lot more gun violence in their communities, which is the main reason they view guns so negatively (IMO)."", ""Democrats overwhelmingly live in cities where guns aren't used as much and there is less reason to have one. Some people have never even really seen or used them or their secondhand experience has been entirely negative.\n\nRepublicans live in rural areas where police response times are higher, there are more areas to target shoot, hunting is part of the culture, the tradition is more valued, etc. That's about it really.\n\n"", 'Supporting gun rights is an easy way for Republicans portray themselves as constitutionalists and the left as authoritarian.  I\'m not gonna argue over which party as a whole is more authoritarian, but Democrats are definitely not scoring any ""freedom points"" in the gun rights department.', 'If you look at places that have a lot of pro-gun control liberals, they are either coastal mid-Atlantic/New England metropolises, or had cultures influenced by such. Conservative, pro-gun culture came out of the frontier, and those different cultures shaped modern views. The New England colonial gun culture was one rooted in an aristocratic obligation to serve the state/crown by being adept at arms. It’s not much different than the feudal ideal of the sons of nobles training in hand-to-hand combat, as they were expected to make up the bulk of the armies. Hence the language about militias in the second amendment; the state wanted a trained, armed populace it could conscript easily.\n\nThe frontier culture, on the other hand, was established by Scots-Irish immigrants that came out of herding cultures. Which meant that the primary threat to their livelihood was poachers and rustlers. Given the dispersed nature of herding communities, and that the crown didn’t really care about protecting the Scots and Irish anyway, they developed a culture of the property owner or renter handling rustlers themselves. In the case of the American frontier, it was a weak state rather than an indifferent one that kept the view of the state as being no help going.\n\nSo for the liberal areas, as the nature of military service changed and became an internal operation rather than conscription, the emphasis on individual gun ownership waned as it was never really about the guns themselves but the social obligation. The conservative areas never lost this, though, as the frontier simply kept expanding and so the rationale remained. By the time the frontier “closed” it had become so ingrained that it was more a case of identity that practical need. Thus why guns carry a cultural weight for conservative areas that gun control doesn’t for liberal ones.', ""People in rural areas know how guns work. That why they don't support idiotic legislations like banning barrel shrouds or silencers. They know that when you fire an AR15  that one bullet comes out. People who live in blue areas get their knowledge about guns from watching movies and playing video games."", ""It just goes to the nature of the two parties.  Democrats generally favor regulation and don't read the Constitution in a strict manner.  The nature of being progressive is to want change.  Republicans at least historically don't like big government or regulation. They see the Constitution as sacred and are more strict in thier interpretation."", 'Liberals tend to want to idiot-proof things, and this drives a lot of their interest in government regulation.  Mandatory seatbelt and motorcycle helmet laws can be seen as versions of this.  The strongest defense of gun control is really that people get angry or careless and do things they later regret (men get temporarily depressed and shoot themselves, gun owners get careless and little kids find them, couples fight and someone gets shot).  Decreasing the amount of guns reduces the possibility those mistakes will happen (and if they happen in other ways say with knives or overdoses, they are less likely to be permanent).  In fact, part of the left-wing desire to legalize drugs is that it will allow the government to better regulate drugs.  Liberals don\'t believe in you having the individual freedom to do things that actually hurt others: if your firearm endangers your neighbor\'s kid, then maybe you ought not to have that firearm.  \n\nThe liberal focus on gun violence is also a product of liberalism\'s right-ward, neoliberal shift.  Much of what gets categorized as ""gun violence"" is actually just poor people working jobs connected to the black market.  A more classic social democratic solution would focus on getting those young men good paying jobs so they weren\'t tempted to turn to the black market.  The neoliberal solution is to maintain class inequality, but to take the gangs\' guns away.  \n\nConservatives, by contrast, tend to have a very absolute belief in free will.  People are always simply responsible for their own actions, and accordingly big public problems should be fixed with more individual responsibility.  Modern conservativism also has a big a persecution complex which is driven by a paranoid fear of the other.  (This is how you can have forty years of neoliberal rule combined with a belief that Obama is a socialist.)  Individual gun ownership is compatible with an emphasis on social order if you believe that the appropriate social order is one in which people like you are on top, that the racial minorities are out to get people like you, and that the state will not protect people like you (because the left has taken it over and defanged it).', ""It's a new phenomenon (well, relatively new). in the 1970s, Reagan, as governor of California, signed laws restricting gun rights and conservatives were fine with it. \n\nHowever, in the 1970s, the NRA was taken over by activists that changed it from a sporting and safety organization to a hard right group that fought any gun regulation. And it did so with industry support, in order to help drive up gun sales. Increased crime in the 1970s was leading to more calls for gun regulations and restrictions, and the gun industry preferred an alternative: lots more people buying guns. So the NRA went to advocating that everyone should have guns, and lots of them. \n\nIn an era of spiking crime (which went up steadily from the 60s to the early 90s, mainly due to lead poisoning), and then the crack wars of the 80s, people in cities saw loose gun regulations causing serious damage, so the NRA's message didn't resonate. But it did in rural areas. \n\nSo the NRA quickly found people more receptive to their message in rural areas than urban.  Then from the 1980s to the 2010s, rural areas became more Republican in general, leading to the republican Party broadly adopting the NRA's agenda as its own, since the NRA funded Republicans so much. \n\nIt is the result of a steady stream of donations, funding, and other payments from the NRA to the Republican party and to Republican candidates. "", ""> Is there som historical reason for why each side settled on their stance?\n\nThe Republican party represents rural and suburban Americans, the Democratic party represents urban and professional Americans.

Doesn't the Bruen decision open the door to stringent gun regulation?,"I must be missing something, which is why I'm asking:

In a nutshell, last year's Bruen decision from the Supreme Court says all gun laws must be consistent with the country’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation"".  To me, this suggests one of two mutually exclusive things:

1) Laws cannot limit/regulate weapons that were not explicitly regulated during the Founding era, meaning that one can legally possess a modern handgun, assault rifle, howitzer, or nuclear bomb (all falling under the definition of ""arms"").

2) Laws can limit weapons to those regulated during the Founding era, meaning the 2nd amendment only protects an individual's right to possess muzzle-loading firearms (and maybe cannons).

It seems that Bruen either opens the door to an individual right to possess *any* weapon, including WMD's - because those were never regulated historically - or it opens the door to outlawing any weapon that wasn't regulated at the time of the founding.  If that's true, then we can outlaw breechloading weapons (aka, modern firearms).  In fact, we could limit them to flintlock only.

I don't think SCOTUS was advocating for an individual right to possess nukes, so then the implication must be option two, that they were referring to weapons that *were* regulated at the founding, which do not include breechloading weapons.  (For those who don't know, flintlock muzzleloading firearms have relatively short range, are comparatively inaccurate, and have an extremely low rate of fire.)

So... which is it?

After watching this dance you start to understand that it isn't about safety or prevention but instead control.  Gun grabbers are trying to strip unalienable rights.  They do this knowing that those that will commit heinous crimes are people who will not adhere to the rule of law.  Why are there school shootings when they are in gun free zones?  WHO abides by these zones?  Hint:  NOT the people you want to.  \n\nAnd when you say you are going to go after semi-automatics you are directly attacking millions and millions of law abiding Americans.

Do you know how prolific semi-automatic gun ownership is in this country?  Guns are a Pandora's box.  You can't magically delete them from existence nor the knowledge of how to build them.  They are not going away.  \n\nUsing emotion-based arguments and deception that doesn't hold up to basic scrutiny is counterproductive.  Is it because the grabbers are just ignorant?  Sure some are for sure.  But the people most often leading the charge are not operating in ignorance.  They know they are lying to push a narrative to gain control.  And unironically will ultimately enforce their edicts via the barrel of a GUN.  So many of the grabbers are not anti-gun as they profess but rather want to monopolize gun ownership.  \n\nHow many definitions of school shooting are there now?

There is no reason that I should give up my rights because criminals do bad things. Is a simple start. \n\nAs for school shootings the vast majority of school shootings are done by mentally ill people that are already known to police, so if the background checks that we have here in California hasn\'t stopped them (and they don\'t) then what\'s the point of making me pay more and jump through hoops if it\'s ineffective?\nThese guns are also more often than not, illegal. And the AR-15/akm platforms are used very little in school shootings or shootings in general. Pistols kill more people annually than any other firearm category.\n\nIn addition I think a lot of people are just sick of the slippery slope. There was a long time where gun restrictions were tightened and tightened and it didn\'t fix anything. The entire time we were told ""it\'s just a little, for public safety, it\'s not like we\'re trying to ban XYZ"". Then in a few years they try to ban XYZ with the same reasoning.\n\nAlso it\'s a right. The second amendment to the bill of rights is second because it\'s important. It is what gives the other rights teeth. Without the second the citizenry is completely helpless to prevent the government from infringing on other rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom to assemble. The second amendment was designed to be used against tyrannical governments. It was written at a time when the vast majority of weapons were privately owned (the entire US navy for years were privately owned war ships that were leased to the government for war). How can it be that the institution that the amendment was written to keep in check can regulate and neuter this amendment? Seems like a conflict if interest no?', ""It's never an automatic weapon, at least not these days unless you count all the lil homies with illegal modifications, already criminals.

They refuse to accept that police have no duty to protect you, nor can the accept the impossibility of that. They refuse to acknowledge that banning guns will do nothing, that little kids in a mud and straw hut in Brazil can make a 1911 out of a block of steel and home made tools, that prisoners have made guns in prison.

Even the deleted things.', '>So, when it comes to school shootings. The majority of the time it’s a semi automatic or automatic weapon doing it. \n\nIt would be in your best interest to learn the difference between semi-auto and automatic. A simple run down of the two is that ""semi-auto"" shoots one round per trigger press, while an automatic (or full-auto) fires continously until empty with 1 press and hold of the trigger. So obviously there hasn\'t been a single shooting that\'s involved a fully automatic weapon. Semi-autos also make up about 90% of modernly owned firearms.\n\n>That’s what I feel like people are against as well as just some extra background checks \n\nTo start off with background checks and ID requirements to purchase firearms already exist. I.e. Felons, Unvoluntarily instituted in mental health facility, and those who aren\'t 18 or 21, and not a resident of the state they reside, can\'t purchase firearms. \n\nThese extra background checks are Universal Background Checks applied to private sales. The issue with this is that you can\'t prove that someone sold ""their"" firearm to someone without a background check until a crime has been committed with that gun, (and that\'s not a guarantee), and it essentially puts the blame of the crime on the saler, when the perpetrator, who used the gun maliciously, should be solely responsible for his own actions. \n\nAlso firearms are private property, you\'re not an ffl retailer or a manufacturer, corporate laws shouldn\'t apply to the individual, it\'s your property, you shouldn\'t have to get the government\'s permission to sell it, otherwise it\'s not yours to begin with. The whole reason background checks for firearms were allowed, is because there was a compromise that it wouldn\'t apply to private owners, and now it\'s considered a loop hole. Compromises always become loop holes when it\'s convenient.\n\n>I totally get owning a rifle or shotgun for sport if you go hunting. In some cases, \n\nHunting was not the reason the 2nd amendment was created to protect our rights.\n\n>I understand owning a pistol to defend your home incase anything happens.\n\nThis contradicts your earlier point about your grievances of semi-autos, as the majority of all handguns, especially those used in self defense are semi-auto, even the most well known, 113 year old, handgun, the 1911, is by nature a single action, semi-auto.\n\n>So I’ll kind of go back to my question. Why do you as a pro gun person feel so negatively towards the things I mentioned.\n\nBecause it\'s always the same thing. Introduce a law, nothing changes, introduce another law and the same outcome occurs. All these laws do is punish innocent people, with no intention of harming others, and blaming them for the wicked actions of another. Why should Anyone else or I be expected to give up anything because of what someone else does, there\'s no logic in it, only emotional outcry by those most ignorant on firearms.', '\\#1 Because I don\'t break the law and commit murder, there are laws for that already, including background checks for guns, no amount of extra background checks will work, people have free will and crazy murderous people wont stop   EVER; any law or legislation is usually reactive, once you make them proactive you shit on peoples freedoms (ie: you break a law / minority report doesnt exist yet...), that\'s just how the universe works...\n\n\\#2 Fuck you or anyone that wants to limit my freedom\n\nIn all seriousness, the problem surrounding shootings and such today is societal, you cannot have Marxists or whatever political or philosophical ideology coming into a divisive  and financially shitty time trying to upend culture/society for a ""vision of a utopia society"", that is how you get this mess, some crazy people cannot cope with the fast change of culture/society (or their own life choices)', 'See, I glaze my eyes across your post, and all I hear is you blaming the object and not the twisted freaks holding it.

Also, ""Extra Background Checks""? What does that even mean? You gonna background check a gun owner twice like that\'s supposed to accomplish something?\n\nAnd ""I totally get owning a rifle or shotgun for sport if you go hunting"". What a joke. The second amendment was never about hunting but I guess a sheltered civilian like you doesn\'t comprehend the concept of a government ever being evil or turning on its own citizens.

You might say. \n\nI am less concerned about my personal safety from this narrow type of public violence than I am about mass media stoking national anxiety over a localized event and driving contagion in a way that measurably contributes to clusters of similar events. It\'s a real phenomenon. More could be done instantaneously to reduce harm by changing the national conversion itself if all sides were actually serious. Items that fall under the political designation of assault weapons are not the origin of strife and societal division in our communities. \n\n“These weapons of war, assault weapons, have no reason other than mass murder. Their only purpose is to kill humans as rapidly as possible in large numbers.” You might say.\n\n  Abusus non tollit usum. If there is no proper use for mid-power, semi-auto rifles, then stop issuing them to law enforcement agents. In what way is law and order being upheld by issuing law enforcement agents items that we are repeatedly assured have the only conceivable purpose of killing as many people as possible in the shortest time possible? Why in the world would law enforcement need to do that?\n\n""But police are specially trained and encounter uniquely dangerous situations."" You might say.\n\nNo. What you are describing is a class of super citizens. Police and civilians have access to the same equipment and training. There are plenty of civilians who voluntarily train themselves at levels similar to or higher than regular police officers. Civilians routinely encounter dangerous people and situations before police arrive on the scene. Typically police arrive on the scene after the tragic conclusion of dangerous situations. \n\n  All of the public safety rhetoric conveniently ignores the legitimate defensive use of guns and how that could translate into loss of life when individuals who are not prohibited firearm owners are not free to protect themselves with the means that they believe are the most effective. \n\nSelf defense is the most ancient human right. Everybody should be free to defend themselves by any means that they see fit. This includes portable devices that project force in a precise manner that can be used in an emergency. This device is called the gun. The principle internal functioning of the gun has not changed in 150 years. \n\nGuns are not illegal because arms are not illegal. Arms are not illegal because they are necessary. Arms are necessary for individual and collective defense. Necessity is written into the actual text of the document that constitutes our Federal Government. \n\nNobody wants prohibited persons accessing illicit weapons. Nobody wants firearms to be misused. What we don\'t do is give guns to babies. Because they are babies. What else we do not do in liberal democracies is treat individuals like babies without due-process.\n\n  ""If only the gun rights lobby would compromise just a little bit, then there would be no violent crime."" You might say.\n\nRemember, folks - everybody\'s rights have to be violated until some people shape up - is not the proper analysis of the Bill of Rights. Gun owners did compromise in 1934 (NFA), 1968 (GCA), 1986 (FOPA), 1994 (AWB). No more. Once the right is lost, it is never coming back. \n\nNational Firearms Act (1934): Allowed ownership of automatic weapons with heavy regulation and taxation. Gun Control Act (1968): Established a system for firearms dealers and background checks without restricting types of firearms for citizens. Firearm Owners\' Protection Act (1986): Grandfathered existing automatic weapons, limited ATF\'s powers, and protected against registration. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (1994): Included a sunset provision for the assault weapons ban, allowing for its expiration and did not ban possession or transfer of these weapons. \n\nThe good will of the gun owning public is being swept away as a function of the systematic reversal of the protections that were guaranteed as necessary to garner broad support for these legislative acts. Chipping away at the compromises and distrust in our Government institutions is what leads us down the path of, no more NFA, no more GCA, no more FOPA, no more AWBs. \n\nIt\'s all finished. No more compromises and no more using past compromises of rights as a model for taking more rights away. It\'s all going back to square-one. It\'s all going back to the Constitution: Federal power as an island in a sea of freedoms. \n\nThere is no Gun Control, only gun monopolies.

Unintentional firearm deaths of children are 3-4 times more likely, according to CDC and FBI statistics. Focusing on safe firearms handling & education from a young age would guarantee to save many lives in the process--that's why in my home, we demystify firearms through safe, responsible exposure and keeping them locked up when they're not being used for their intended purpose.\n\nWhat is far more tragic is that our lawmakers refuse to take *effective* action through safeguarding our schools and addressing the root causes of violence (income inequality, mental health, and the erosion of community & family are primarily to blame). Banning semiautomatics, restricting magazine capacities, or banning accessories will not change the mind of a would-be murderer. E.g. It seems that everyone forgets that the Columbine shooters had attempted to employ bombs and fire as well...thankfully, they were not successful in those measures.\n\nThere exists a possible version of America where gun rights are both protected and so are children.

"Defenders of gun rights, is there a level of gun violence at which you'd say significant new gun regulations were needed?","At present about 10,000 people in the US are killed by guns per year. This is greater than any other first-world country by a factor of at least 3.

If there was an unambiguous, growing epidemic of gun violence would you come around to believing some significant changes were needed to do something about the availability of guns?

For instance, if something like Sandy Hook were happening once a week, or everyday. If it became more like 100,000 killed by guns a year, or a million.

The issue I have with gun control is that the majority of gun violence is perpetuated by people who already live outside the law on a daily basis. So unless our hypothetical gun violence increase takes the form of housewives shooting their children for getting Cs in Math or people routinely gunning down their neighbors over barking dogs I don't see what good disarming the general population would do.\n\nIt's not really a cost-benefit thing because I'm not sure the cost can be mitigated with gun control.

By comparison, it was 5.07 per hundred thousand of the population in 1970"" - Congressional Research Service, ""Mass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013""\n\nIn other words, gun homicide is at an all time low, at least for those of us 45 years or younger can remember.\n\nAbout ""Mass shootings""?  The same report explains:\n\n""Mass shootings make up a smaller percentage of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter incidents. For the 13-year period (1999-2011), CRS data show that at least 272 (0.14%) of the BJS-reported 197,191 murder and nonnegligent manslaughter incidents were mass shootings, accounting for 1,316 (0.63%) of the 208,425 homicide victims in those incidents. ""\n\nAnd also about ""Assault"" weapons and mass shootings:\n\n""In summation, out of 317 “mass shootings,” offenders used firearms that could be characterized \nas “assault weapons” in 31 incidents (9.78%), or \nroughly 1 out of 10 incidents."" \n\n[For those interested in the report itself](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44126.pdf)\n\nIn the early 90s, as the above-cited statistics show, gun violence in the United States was at an all-time high, as was violent crime in general, since then it has declined substantially.  Many theories exist as to why this decline occurred, ranging from decreased lead exposure to the legalization of abortion in the early 70s, decreased consumption of crack cocaine, increased incarceration and length of criminal sentences, etc.  The federal Assault Weapon Ban was enacted in 1994 but such prohibited rifles/pistols made up a small fraction of the firearms used in total gun crimes.\n\nIf the firearm homicide rate increased say, to 1992-93 levels we\'d have to re-evaluate what factors led to such an increase and react accordingly.  It might not be prudent to enact a firearm-related law specifically unless that was justified by good reliable data.\n\nGenerally speaking, any law that would tend to impose restrictions on law-abiding gun owners, such as attempts to curtail concealed carry or banning firearm/firearm features that do not substantially contribute to crime would probably be ineffective in any case.  Gun registration presumably would be obeyed only by law-abiding citizens so its effectiveness is debatable.  FYI, if a law-abiding person goes full out insane and uses a ""registered"" gun to commit a crime, registration probably won\'t prevent said crime.\n\nThere are also controversial laws/practices that could be construed as some form of ""gun control"", such as New York City\'s ""stop and frisk"" which is exalted by its supporters as an effective way of lowering crime and lambasted by its opponents as an impotent measure and a civil rights violation.', 'no as I view guns as just a tool which can be used for good or bad.\n\nIf violence got that high, then there is some underlying cause that simply getting rid of guns would not solve. We could break it down country by country, but gun laws do not have a positive or negative effect on crime.\n\nAs for cost-benefit, there are as many lawful defensive uses of firearms as there are unlawful uses per year and the fact that they are relatively simple tools to make, criminals will always have access to firearms unless we can un-invent them.\n\nIf we look at the UK, which banned most guns, we can see a trend that about a hundred years prior to the ban, the crime rate is about the same low crime rate it is today. The only change banning guns had for them is a huge spike in crime right after the ban happened, taking a few years to get down to pre-ban levels.\n\nI can point your question back at you though, is your position at all the product of a cost-benefit analysis? After all, the only thing a gun ban would do is disarm the law abiding populace, it would do nothing to stop criminals from having weapons.', 'There is no new regulation needed, the states that put in feel good laws after Newtown are lying to themselves. \n\nIn *most* states you need a concealed carry permit in order to carry a firearm. In my state, and most others, you need to apply at your sheriff and it costs around $100, at least, plus the class which is anywhere from $50-100. \n\nDo you really think a criminal is going to do that? No, criminals have been interviewed in studies before, and the vast majority say they just get someone they know who is clean to straw purchase weapons for them, something that is already a felony. \n\nMeanwhile, states that have allowed CC and permitless carry have seen none of the increases in violence that people like the Brady Campaign and MDA have insisted would occur. \n\nIn fact, since Newtown gets brought up constantly, I would say cases like it, and the Chattanooga shooting prove that what we need is *less* gun free zones. If a criminal wants to shoot up a school, he is going to do it whether or not the window has a sticker that says ""No Guns Allowed"" and all it does is guarantee that a teacher, the principal, or some sort of armed guard will have no way at all to stop people from being systematically executed  while the police arrive, cordon off the area, and go in with SWAT. \n\nThe fact is that of that 10,000 killed by guns a year, the vast majority are suicides. Yes there is a correlation between gun ownership and suicide, just like you\'re more likely to drown if you own a swimming pool, but even the \n\nWhat we also need to take into account is that in certain counties, gangs make up over 80% of the crime there, and on average: 40% of the crime in the country, crime including murder. What is the source of the vast majority of shootings in the US today? Gangs shooting other gangs. Around 300 people were killed by rifles in 2011 by the FBI\'s own statistics, 1,700 people a year are killed by lightning. The problem, which statistically speaking, isn\'t a problem if you look at deaths in the US every year by heart disease, being punched to death, or being stabbed, is that we *sensationalize* mass murderers. \n\nHow about we stop spending hour after hour waxing the poetic about Adam Lanza, Columbine, and Virginia Tech, then these people won\'t think that ""hey, nobody likes me now, but they\'ll remember me forever!"" \n\nAnother thing we should do is educate our kids on guns and their proper safety. Too many people see them as violent murder machines that can go off at any moment, but are fine with them being fetishized in Holywood.

Another question about the incoming gun regulations...,"Edit: “advocated for” regulation

If you look it up, you will find that an incredibly  small percentage of mass shootings, or even shootings in general, are done with “assault weapons” or as Jennifer Dillon keeps calling them, “weapons of war”.

Why are we putting extra regulations on these weapons, when a vast majority of these shooting are done with pistols?

This is intentional to muddy the waters. \n\nI’m a mass shooting survivor...While my shooter used hand guns, he upgraded the weapons to hold as much amo as possible. My shooter purchased 3,000 rounds of ammo and no one bothered to say thing....maybe.. had red flag laws been introduced he books, we might have saved 13 lives and prevented 30 people from being wounded. This does not include the PTSD aspect for the survivors. \n\nBlUFF: The AR platform is a force multiplier.  The body counts are much higher when an AR used.  So your logic is flawed and intellectually dishonest. \n\nAnd this angers me. It’s like “piss on kids that were shot in the head.. muh freedoms.... “ is the dumbest argument. I’m sure you know a few people who shouldn’t have unfettered access to assault weapons (I know a few).\n\nI’d be okay with ARs on the market, if we had compressive red flag laws and Deep background checks.
