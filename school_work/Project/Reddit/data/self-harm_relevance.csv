What aspects of self-harm are not talked about much?,"For me:

1. Non-impulsive, planned self-harm

2. Self-harm being very competitive, people feeling not valid because of ""not enough"" scars and having the urges to cut deeper and deeper

3. People loving their scars, feeling good looking at them and wanting more, unhealthy attraction to scars and sh

4. People feeling urges to show their fresh wounds and watching another's (and these communities to share pics/vids, once deleted - two new ones appear)

PSA. SELF HARM MAY CAUSE SELF HARM.,"I have noticed a lot of the members on this sub are actually covert enablers, which sickens me. So I already know I‚Äôm about to be swarmed by the predators but regardless, I‚Äôve noticed a super disturbing trend on here where people have absolutely no idea how dangerous self harm is. First of all. Let‚Äôs start with the glamorizing nicknames. It can be very enabling to others by downplaying the seriousness of the situation by referring to a potentially life ending injury as ‚Äúbeans11!!1‚ÄùYou are lacerating your skin. They are cuts, not pets. Stop giving them the cutsie nicknames.  it makes it so difficult for people to take you seriously when you do. Because it shows your lack of awareness. Second of all do you guys actually understand how scarring works? Because the same people talking about ‚Äúbeans‚Äù then ask for advice on how to make they scars ‚Äúgo away faster‚Äù they‚Äôre scars. They don‚Äôt go away. Some of them don‚Äôt even faded. I have scars that are over 5 years old that are still red protruding, and VERY noticeable. These will be on my skin for the rest of my life. So will yours. And no, good hygiene may help lessen this but it does not prevent this. A lot of scars actually become more noticeable over the years if they came from burns or you required stitches. Y‚Äôall are taking your body‚Äôs for granted. Third of all, I had two freinds who were sent to icu due to sepsis one of them has suffered a heart attack from hers and now has a pacemaker. That basically means she has a electronic device keeping her alive and without it her heart would fail. I‚Äôm gonna let you guys go ahead and guess how they got the sepsis. Now as a ‚Äúsenior‚Äù member of this sub let me just say, we are not stupid, nor dull, nor born yesterday. It‚Äôs very easy to tell by how things are worded and post history that the vast majority of you are extremely young. As in, be aware there are people who started self harming on here before you were even born. When one of these people try‚Äôs to give you advice or tough love don‚Äôt shut them down. Unless they‚Äôre being weird or are straight up incorrect. Odds are they‚Äôre trying to stop you from hurting yourself. I would rather offend one of you then spare my words then have you end up dead from ignorance. My point is we KNOW many of you are far too young to be able to understand the effects of what you‚Äôre doing to yourself. This is why we call people under 18 minors. It means they are too young to be making certain LIFE CHANGING decisions for themselves, not cause they‚Äôre stupid but cause they‚Äôre kids. None of us are on this sub because we feel good. We all could be more supportive and informative to eachother, but when you try to turn your pain and your Injurys into a competition, that‚Äôs where arguments start. Nobody is better than anyone else on this sub. But some are more informed. We know which ones of you want to seek validation for your acts of self hatred and which ones of you are genuinely seeking help. If you have no intentions of quitting or you think it‚Äôs cool that‚Äôs fine but bring that shit to a circlejerk sub and not on here please. Now about the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs a safe space‚Äù argument. In what sense? Sugarcoating and normalizing self harm isn‚Äôt damage prevention it‚Äôs quite literally the opposite. Do you know what happens when a bunch of addicts try to live together? It becomes a very DANGEROUS place. For all of them. I‚Äôm just ranting at this point but I guess my main point is if I had a forum like this available to me at 15 years old I would have been dead a very very long time ago. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs doing alot of y‚Äôall favors. Please stay safe n stay alive. And try to have a good day.

Though I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with what you said about scars fading, it‚Äôs not wrong to ask how to make scars fade quicker; they don‚Äôt go away, but they can lessen. I am still a minor (16) but with my age group, self harm has definitely become a trend amongst people - this is the truth, people do it for attention sometimes, I‚Äôve met people like this. But again, the majority do have their own personal issues going on, we shouldn‚Äôt judge young people for not knowing how to cope. When I was molested at 9 through 10, self harm was the only way I knew how to cope; I wish I hadn‚Äôt started but I did, and from there in it‚Äôs been nothing but that for me (though I haven‚Äôt cut myself since April! The longest I‚Äôve gone I believe?). The consequences to self harm should be more well known tbh, I get scared to wear my arms bare sometimes because of my scars, it makes me feel more ugly than I do.

Sometimes it feels like you‚Äôre alone, but you‚Äôre not, there are people out there who do love you.

On one hand, they serve as valuable harm-reduction spaces for people to vent or seek advice without judgement, but on the other hand, like you pointed out, putting a bunch of addicts in a group isn't the greatest idea. You will have people there with you who understand and are willing to help, and that can be life saving for some, but it can also continue to reinforce the self harming behavior.\n\nPersonally it helps me a lot to receive validation and be able to yell out into the void except the void is kind and understanding and will never judge me and is always there when I need it. I've been here for years, and while spaces like this can trigger me sometimes, they are still important to me when I need a space to vent anonymously to people like me who will understand, instead of traumatizing my friends.\n\nI'd only really recommend spaces like this to people who have been self harming for a long time, not people (and much less minors) who just started since they are the people most vulnerable to being influenced negatively like spaces such as this tbh.

Most sharp objects people use aren\'t sturdy and can easily go oopsie and slip causing extreme complications. Nobody should be competitive about something like that.

Almost like you can‚Äôt self harm unless you know any better or you‚Äôre above 18. Mate, no one should self harm at all. Self harming is a symptom of several severe mental illness and reflect an extremely poor mental state. The normalisation of self harm isn‚Äôt a trend, it‚Äôs just mentally ill people trying to excuse a crippling addiction. Even the whole mentality of someone being better due to their severe self harm is ALSO a symptom to several severe mental disorders. This ain‚Äôt teens not taking a serious problem seriously, it‚Äôs teens experiencing serious things and reflecting their nonchalant attitude from how others treat their issues. Families, friends, even professionals don‚Äôt take newer generations seriously because of this mentality that it‚Äôs just done for attention and it‚Äôs todays ‚Äúnew thing‚Äù, when it‚Äôs becoming more popular because todays generation is holding a lot on their shoulders, including attention seeking mental disorders (hpd, bpd, etc), which leaves uneducated people (people like you) feeding into minimalistic mindsets. Even when you‚Äôre talking about the damages of having ‚Äúbetter thans‚Äù all because their self harm is severe or they have been doing it for longer, I sort of get a hypocritical type feel to it, because your whole post is basically using that messed up privilege of a position to blurt out a whole bunch of utter nonsense. Your lack of understanding is literally so agitating ü§¶\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è, yet you act like you know more, or as you say, ‚Äúmore informed‚Äù.

Can‚Äôt even start on the safe space argument you got going on. Quit critiquing teens on decisions they make when they‚Äôre at their lowest. Everyone who self harms will make that decision at least once, to engage with other self harmers. It‚Äôs not a well put together decision, it‚Äôs mentally ill people BEING MENTALLY ILL. And besides, during this time of bad decisions, is where people usually get help. Involuntary, forced help. So they have to get help. This is where people‚Äôs start to recovery happens. As the saying goes, you gotta hit your worst until you can reach your best. This saying is particularly applied to mentally ill teens who engage in self harm, because they literally feel better as they get worse. So there‚Äôs no way to help them until they reach so low that they even shock themselves. You get my drift? Even the people replying are such icks üò≠üò≠ ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been self harming for 25 years and I agree ‚òùÔ∏èüòù‚Äù, they‚Äôre literally using their status in a community where they self harm in order to engage in conversations about self harm?

And even so, since your status in this community is so high (I‚Äôm being sarcastic), aren‚Äôt you desensitised from the thousands of years of hurting yourself? 4+4 isn‚Äôt equaling 8. Last thing I do want to say is that self harm isn‚Äôt really being destigmatised and desensitised around actual wounds, but more so scars. But even if wounds and cutting in general was destigmatised and desensitised it‚Äôd probably make people more comfortable in talking about their issues with cutting, therefore easier for people to find help or for those who they‚Äôre in having with to make them find help.', ""i been self harming from 12 years old until now i am 25 years old i am trying to stop self harm but is kind of hard when you feel depressed nobody likes you wants you i been lonely i don't as anyone who cares for me even if i try to find someone my communication i feel like i am sucks at everything and never been in relationship feels so sad that nobody will accept me but i try to change is not easy whenever i feel sad depression sad only things i think of is self harm""]"

I have been through this before. His behavior is absolutely unacceptable. This is extremely manipulative. When I went through it, my ex would hang suicidal thoughts over my head, and he would get extremely angry to the point of hurting himself during fits of rage and make it my fault. These sorts of behaviors are absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable. What he needs is therapy, not a relationship. This could be considered emotional abuse. Constantly living in a state of anxiety and walking on eggshells to avoid your partner physically harming themselves is no way to live.\n\nYou deserve so much better from a partner. It is clear this person has major mental health issues, and they should not be in a relationship while they are doing this kind of thing to someone. Having problems is not an excuse to hurt others.\n\nI have been on the other side of this, having struggled with self-harm and suicidal ideation for a very long time, including while in a relationship. Not once have I ever even considered doing to past partners what your partner is doing to you. There is no excuse for manipulating and hurting others in this way. Mental health issues are not an excuse for manipulating people or completely disregarding their boundaries, especially in the bedroom. I had to take a step back and go seek help because it was affecting my partner to see me in such a poor mental state, and my failing mental health is not their problem to fix or such a burden they need to bear. Even in my poor mental state though, I never would even consider disregarding my partner's boundaries and consent like that. That's just pure lack of respect  for you, and prioritization of his own desires.1\n\nTouching on the fact that he kept trying to pressure you into sexual acts, that is absolutely not okay for anyone to do to you at any time. Period. You should not be in a relationship with anyone who so blatantly disregards your boundaries and consent with sex. The fact that after this, he decided to tell you he hurt himself, makes me feel that he knows what he is doing, and is intentionally being manipulative in order to try and control how you are acting towards him. Of course, nobody could truly know his intent behind it, but it sure as hell feels that way.\n\nMy best advice is to leave this relationship. This man  is using his issues to manipulate you and control how you act towards him and how you respond to his own mistakes. Regardless of whether he is intentionally and maliciously manipulating you, or if he just has really severe issues and doesn't realize just how poorly he is behaving, this is never going to change until he takes steps to help himself and realizes that his behavior is both inappropriate and inexcusable. If he tries to use self-harm or suicide as a manipulation tactic to get you to stay, the best advice I can give is to call the emergency line and tell them he is continuously or aggressively threatening suicide/self-harm and is a danger to himself. I have a relative who threatened suicide during an argument with her boyfriend, and this was done with intent to manipulate and get him to concede to what she wanted. He actually called emergency services on her, and they committed her to the psych hospital for an involuntary 72hr hold. She never used suicide or self harm during an argument again after that. \n\nI hope things get better OP. You deserve better from a partner, and you shouldn't have to walk on eggshells just to keep someone from hurting themselves. You shouldn't ever be treated with a lack of respect for your boundaries and consent. You shouldn't ever be pressured into sexual acts by anyone, especially your partner. Therapy is needed here.

I am so happy that for most of you with lived experience, this is a message of hope and feeling seen. I thought when this post first came up more people would be worried about the potential trigger, but it\'s so great that overall the impact is positive instead.\n\nWith that said, I do wonder a bit about the impact in a group younger/less mature than the people on this subreddit. Some folks in this thread have mocked the idea of ""catching"" self-harm from a photo, but for teens in particular we actually have a lot of evidence for a social contagion effect in a) self-harm, b) suicidal behaviour, and c) eating disorders (I am a mental health professional, and I  work with post-secondary students). I also have personal experience with self-harm social contagion as a teen. In my middle school, I lived through somewhat of a self-harm epidemic that swept my immediate friend group, and also some other female cliques (only counting what I knew of- there may have been more). I know it sounds ridiculous but there truly was a somewhat competitive nature to it, in that the girls would compare their scars, cuts, and marks, and gossip about them. One friend of mine at the time even went so far as to use makeup to (unconvincingly) create fake marks on her arm.  Speaking for my own friend group, this was not even a particularly ""troubled"" group of girls- it was an upper/middle class suburb and they all had stable, non-abusive homes. I don\'t say that to minimize- their pains and struggles were very real- only to highlight that there\'s no particular reason these girls should have been especially ""at risk"" for developing this coping mechanism. This all started shortly after self-harm was featured in a plot on Degrassi: The Next Generation, which we all watched. \n\nThis is just to say, it\'s not ridiculous to wonder or worry about the impact on young people, and it may be very different than the experiences of the recovered, adult, self-harm survivors in this thread. Teen minds are not logical. However, could a model\'s photo like this create social contagion like I witnessed? Not likely. The causes of something that that are very complex, and in the case I experienced, there was daily social conversation in the peer group related to self-harm, which is totally different than seeing a photo of a healed scar on a website. I am inclined to still agree this is a good thing. There are better ways to help teens with their mental health than by censoring bodies. I can\'t exactly get back into a teenage headspace, but if one of my friends saw this back then, I would like to think they would see it as a message of hope and healing vs. an invitation to self-harm any further.', 'I love this. ‚ô•Ô∏è', 'I‚Äôm not a huge fan of this.

Some researchers at mit patented the therapeutic range with I‚Äôm fairly certain is .3 milligrams. Other companies seeing this cash cow said hey I want to make money too so they released the drug with 5mg a pil. Make sure you get the right dose', 'Man, seems every day there are conflicting studies on whether melatonin is okay to take or not.', 'Here is a prime example of the impact of pharmaceutical industry sponsorship on research outcomes. This is also a very dangerous statement to make, in general, as will be evidenced by parents turning to melatonin as a therapeutic option for self-harming teenagers. Very irresponsible.', 'Correlation is not causation', 'This reads very strongly as evidence that melatonin does not cause the decrease, and that, while otherwise high quality data, this is just regression to the mean / confounding.\n\nNote that the prescriptions are triggered by the school year, as schooling is a major cause of adolescent suicide & mental disorders (""Melatonin treatment was initiated most commonly during the month of November, while July and August were the months with the fewest new melatonin users (Figure S1).""), and look closely at Figure 1: there is a *huge* spike in self-harm/poisonings *right before* melatonin prescription which then almost immediately drops down to baseline; further, if they were having sleep issues which the melatonin fixed (and that mediated the - absurdly large if causal - mental health benefits), why is there precisely zero correlate in falls/transport-accidents? (For comparison, when American high schools change their schedules to not screw with adolescents by waking them up as early as possible, you *can* see substantial decreases in auto accidents...) Why is there no equivalent analysis showing spikes when they go *off* melatonin? They have the data for that, and spikes on discontinuation (which you see in the other population-registries with connections like violence/going off schizophrenia meds) would be expected if you believed the absurdly large causal claims being made here, and would be hard to explain by the original self-selection/confounding. They also bury this:\n\n> We estimated IRRs of injuries using month -12 (rather than month -1) as the reference category. In these analyses, the risk of self-harm was higher throughout the year following melatonin-use initiation (Figure S11).\n\nNaturally, of course, after a hurried discussion of selection bias (smaller than their discussion of the ways in which melatonin could be wonderful), they conclude:\n\n> These findings suggest that treating sleep disturbances associated with depression and anxiety may be an important factor in decreasing the risk of intentional injuries and poisoning in this pediatric population. Further studies are needed to examine the efficacy of melatonin and other sleep-improvement interventions in reducing self-harm.\n\nI would disagree with both. I like & use melatonin - but this ain\'t it, chief. These large-scale whole-population-registry findings provide strong evidence it is an *un*important factor, and further studies are *not* needed unless you can come up with better evidence.', 'My cousin tried ODing on a bottle of melatonin.', ""I'm happy for them.

I was a daily cutter up until that point and had just broken my highest streak - four months - two months prior and it was downhill from there, I thought. \n\nBut then one day, the last day, something changed. I somehow escaped a psychosis-induced suicide attempt and really had to reconsider my position because clearly something wasn't working. \n\nI was finally ready to let go. I still self-harm in really dire situations but even those are becoming rarer and rarer as time moves on. \n\nI still struggle, of course, but I no longer constantly wish to cause myself injury (from a negative place, anyway. body mods are huge for me). I thought I would never get better... and then I did. \n\nI'm 18 now. I'm living with my fianc√©e who I am marrying this year (this decision to get married so young was not made without hundreds of hours of conversation and thought on the matter. This is not hasty nor is it from a lack of care or consideration of the future). We're moving across the country by this time next year. I'm looking to start making soap and resin art and adult pacifiers (for people with oral fixations, people looking to cope and unwind a little with something soothing and personal, fellow neurodivergent folks who want it for stimming) and stim toys. Candy making. And all sorts of other crafty projects (to start a fun and rewarding side job to supplement my partner's income brought so we can save faster, with more respect for each other, more feeling capable of these big steps). I'm also looking for work at nearby hotels (for front desk duty) because retail or food service would probably cause me to have meltdowns (autism) or panic attacks. Or general downward spirals, really. It's too stressful.\n\nBut behind a desk? Mostly alone with set tasks to handle (such as data analysis), freedom to move and get comfortable, and being the first impression of the hotel? I would thrive there. \n\nI'm rambling a lot. I've derailed. Back to the point. \n\nWhen you're in the fire, you think there's no way it could ever stop burning. It's too painful. It's grasping for your insides, pulling your soul out through your lips. But when the fire dies down and goes out, and it will, it has to at some point, what survived the flame will go on to be stronger, more stable. More prepared for the fire. \n\nLife is a collection of experiences. This is one of yours. \n\nI'm proud of you. You've got a long way to go, but I'm proud of you. Great job. I hope you have a fantastic day. \n\nPlease, wherever you are, stay safe, eat your breakfast and dinner, and keep hydrated. Your health is very important. \n\nAnyway, that's enough rambling and weirdness from me.

i am 3 months self-harm free !!,"it has been difficult and hard but honestly these last 3 months have been pretty good and also motivating to continue taking care of myself. i have a small but great group of friends that make me laugh all the time and my dogs that always make me smile

Self harm is a stupid process of feeling the need to harm oneself due to external factors. Looks or being bullied for being a certain way. You do NOT deserve the harm done to yourself. You need to bounce back from those situations. I learned over time that it takes experience to know but it takes trust to listen to someone telling you it's ok. You don't need to hurt yourself. You don't deserve it. No one deserves self inflicted violence. It's not a coping mechanism. It's a copout.

When you implement a zero tolerance policy on any one of these three things do you think for a moment that you just created a rule that bans these three things?  Guns, drugs, and bullying have always been against the rules on school grounds.  The most extreme offenders have not been wandering around freely waving guns, dishing out drugs, and beating the daylights out of students.  The most extreme offenders have figured out how to function within a system without getting caught.  Now that you implemented a zero tolerance policy what's going to happen is your teachers are going to run around the school like a bunch of headless chickens chasing down meaningless soft targets, making it easier for the most extreme offenders, who have already figured out how to avoid you or this problem wouldn't be happening.\n\nOn top of that zero tolerance policies are such a head-up-your-ass policy where idiots can pretend they're accomplishing something.  When I say zero tolerance policies on guns don't work, do you really think I mean let kids bring guns to school once in a while and let it slide?  No.  Guns have been and always should be illegal to bring to school.  But zero tolerance policies cause teachers to go apeshit and phone in SWAT teams because kids are drawing pictures of guns.  A school winds up on the evening news with a gun scare because Timmy has a piece of Lego in his bag that sort of look like a gun (but not really).  That's just taking common sense and shamelessly casting it to the wind.  We have zero tolerance, that means we act stupid.  Meanwhile there's a drug dealer behind your bleachers who sold a stolen tech 9 to an emotionally disturbed bullied kid, but you didn't see that because you're too busy heroically chasing down pieces of Lego.  \n\nNow let's take the zero tolerance policy and turn it on it's head.  What If I told you I was going to implement a policy where all I was going to do was dedicate all of my time and effort in going after only the worst of the worst, and let everything else slide?  No discipline for minor to medium infractions.  All I care about is finding and punishing the worst baddies.  A lot of people would probably not care for this policy.  People would say you would have a breakdown discipline, that offenders must be dealt with on some way.  That may be true, but my policy would actually gain you greater results in preventing the worst infractions than zero tolerance because I would actually stand a chance in catching a meaningful offender instead of chasing around soft targets. \n\nWhatever policy you have in dealing with anything that causes hardship it must be a policy of measured response.  Don't call the cops because some kid with allergies brought antihistamines to school.  Don't go apeshit over making fanart of their favourite third person shooter video games.  Don't call a SWAT team all because two friends have fun talking smack to one another in the hallway.  Measured response, deal with a situation appropriately and give it no more attention than it requires or deserves.  \n"", ""I'm so glad they took the razor away from them.

Nick Kyrgios thanks Andy Murray for spotting signs of self-harm,"Nick Kyrgios has thanked Andy Murray for helping him to overcome suicidal thoughts after noticing signs of self-harm on the Australian‚Äôs body.

In an exclusive interview with Piers Morgan Uncensored on TalkTV, Kyrgios has given details on his mental health struggles four years ago, when he suffered from depression and substance abuse. Kyrgios, 28, has previously said that he was admitted to a psychiatric ward in London after losing to Rafael Nadal in the second round of Wimbledon in 2019.

Kyrgios has now publicly acknowledged the role that Murray played at the time in raising concerns about his mental state. During a practice session, Murray had asked Kyrgios about abnormal physical damage on his arm before alerting the Australian‚Äôs manager, John Morris.

‚ÄúAndy was always a big supporter of me,‚Äù Kyrgios said. ‚ÄúAs soon as I came on the tour, he kind of saw a work in progress and took me under his wing. Then he realised later in my career that I don‚Äôt think I was coachable or I was on my own path, but he was always someone that was looking out for me.

‚ÄúHe saw it [the self-harm] and he said, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs that on your arm?‚Äô It was pretty bad at that stage. Andy obviously was trying to give me advice on it. But I was just so stuck in my ways at that time that I didn‚Äôt listen. Obviously I‚Äôm very thankful. I thank him a lot.‚Äù

Kyrgios added: ‚ÄúI think it was all a year-and-a-half to two years of just complete harm. It was pretty dark to be honest. I won tournaments on the professional tour, drinking every night, self-harming, burning things on my arm, cutting myself for fun. It became an addiction of pain. I hated myself. I hated waking up and being Nick Kyrgios.‚Äù

This Was For The Parents of Children Who Self-Harmed,"In the worse possible way.  Reflecting on Madam's behavior during her 25 minutes (including Harry and I guess the Surgeon General) this should have been a very somber event with maybe how parents can be more impactful and proactive in their kids' SM activity, good and bad.  

Madam, being so relatable in her Hollywood party outfit, laughed, a lot, and said her kids are too young.  She has no idea what it's like to lose a child.  Unless we believe the miscarriage which she didn't bring up between trying to be relatable and schmoozing with Daly.  She sat front and center and enjoyed the spotlight which it seems much more important than the message.

Funny how she ignores that her ""fans"" have set out to destroy people who don't like her.  And that amount is growing.  

Sorry for the vent.  I wish I could get back to just laughing at her.  She sure likes to exploit dead children, and now the parents.  I wonder if the parents had to sign NDAs.

It was just another excuse for MeGain and Harry to pretend that they are humanitarians. \n\nShe has no relevant experience, competencies or skills to talk about the devastating effects social media can have on teenagers. She has nothing of value to offer those parents. \n\nI don‚Äôt understand why she wasted ¬£6,400 on that awful and inappropriate outfit because she looked like a mess.

She has done it in Uvalde, she has done it with a woman whose child lost his life, and now she\'s done it again with deceased children who ended their lives due to social media atrocities.\nThis is a pattern. She will do it again.\n\nShe\'s using very charged conversations to drive her own point.\nFor example, when she said something like...

All other things aside - she wants everything removed, any shred of accountability people are asking for.

But Friday they ran school wide open‚Ä¶. And then as soon as first bell rang they spotted the kid in the parking lot and locked the school down.. this time with a gym full of targets because Friday night football in the Southern USA is almost religion so every Friday morning they have a huge pep rally with the entire student body in the gym (also parents and much younger siblings come too.

It was FLOODED with students and parents asking them was one day‚Äôs worth of school (most of which was already taken up with football game activities) really worth having put all their lives in danger.  Seeing a 15 year old boy talk to the superintendent so bluntly, but so respectfully you could watch the superintendent shrinking in his seat.. further and further while these children told him that he had put money over their lives, they would be actively campaigning for his opponent, and how incredibly embarrassed he SHOULD be.\n\nEven better, this is the son of the metro mega-church‚Äôs pastor which is how he got the job anyway.  We never voted him in.

10 Reasons why self-harm is bad," For whom it may concern. 

> *1. Wound drainage*: it gets everywhere + it rots + it stains + it may leak unexpectedly + it's hard to explain + it uses up a lot of stuff to clean + it's tacky on skin + it's annoying andor painful to clean off when dry

> *2. Damaging even if seems like it's not*: hitting may cause damage internally such as brain damage (worse brain fog!!) Or worsening tiny fractures into a whole broken bone, rubber bands and biting still cause tears and hardening skin (large calluses may be unwieldy). Absolutely, your body is your own and under your control, but you deserve to care for it. It's the only one you got, and it matters because it's yours

> *3. Unsustainable as a coping mechanism*: sure it makes u feel better after experiencing stress, but the high will wear off. You will get used to it. You will want to go deeper as a result and it will be risky, especially if emotions are high and you can't stop yourself from severing a vein or a tendon. you are not as in control as you think you are.

> *4. Risk*: tetanus (lockjaw, seizures, cramps, spasms, fever) + sepsis (deep infection, limb loss, pain, organ failure) harmful bacteria can enter a cut of any size + fractures 

> *5. ITCHY*: scabs itch and itching them prolongs healing time + any scar can itch + the itch will not go away on its own + underneath nails are filthy = infection

> *6. Expensive*: bandages, hospital trips, replaced clothes, replaced bedsheets, towels, mobility aids 

> *7. Mobility issues*: scars are tighter than skin. It'll make it difficult to move that part + involuntary twitches.. aches, nerve damage, 

> *8. Hard to explain*: bruises, scratches, etc. There's only so much 'im just clumsy's u can say unfortunately. It's stressful to hide it. 

> *9. Consuming*: thinking about it constantly. Distracting.

> *10. The cause*: SH, like any addiction, is a symptom, maybe it's depression or PTSD or dysphoria or anything else.. whatever it is, it's bad enough for you to be self-harming and that is your valid. In this way, SH is bad because it means you're hurting.

that no matter what, i‚Äôd succumb to this overlying temptation or compulsion to hurt myself whenever something went wrong. i felt weak and disappointed in myself, mad that i‚Äôd done the very thing that i was so mad at myself for doing, the very thing that destroyed my skin and my image of myself for years.. it brought up a lot of negative emotions, which honestly in some ways made me feel even more compelled to keep doing it. i battled on & off with this problem again in 10th & 11th grade. during this time in my life, i felt completely hopeless. but now i can proudly say that i am over 2 years clean. **it is not impossible,** even if you find yourself at times believing that it is, and even if it feels like it is. **it is only impossible if you let yourself believe that it is.**\n\neventually, i guess i realized that i was not only letting myself suffer, but i was quite honestly making myself suffer for suffering. every time that i would hurt myself, it would be when i was already hurting - because i didn‚Äôt want to feel it, because i didn‚Äôt think i was ‚Äòallowed‚Äô to feel it (i feared it would make me weak, it would inconvenience others, or nobody else would understand), or because i hated a situation that i was in and i didn‚Äôt see a way out without conflict (in turn, feeling feelings that didn‚Äôt serve me/allowing myself to be stuck in a bad spot). it is so important to stop and dissect what we are feeling, what is going on around us that is influencing how we‚Äôre feeling, and why those feelings are so uncomfortable, even though those thoughts are uncomfortable things to think about. we cannot change everything in our lives, but we are lucky enough to have the power to change what we can, and to shift our perspective on what we cannot. it is 100% easier said than done, and it took me years to get to a point in my life where i could reach this spot without just hearing a concept like it and viewing it as some bullshit spewed by ‚Äòsomeone who doesn‚Äôt get it,‚Äô but you have to realize your *power,* OP. you have so much more power than you think you do. \n\nour biggest limitation, as humans, is ourselves. if you convince yourself that you are beyond help, you will never find help/help will never help you. if you convince yourself that you will never be happy, you will never feel happiness in moments that it can be found/you will never be happy no matter what you get in life. you need to believe in yourself, as difficult as that may seem right now. you need to realize that yes, you might‚Äôve made a mistake, but you can acknowledge that it is one, that it isn‚Äôt good for you, and you will fight against it because *you are worth fighting for.* treat yourself like somebody that you love. sometimes you need to force yourself to treat yourself kindly, sometimes you need to just sit there and put your arms around yourself when you have that urge - you‚Äôre hurting, and you mostly want a hug in times like these. you don‚Äôt want to hurt yourself, you just feel like you need to. i promise that you don‚Äôt. i promise that there are other ways to let out your emotions, to feel feelings without hating the fact that you are. \n\ni‚Äôve found that writing about what i‚Äôm feeling helps me a lot, and when i‚Äôm in a clearer headspace, i sometimes go back to what i wrote to better understand how i felt because i‚Äôm not in the height of it all. i also recently took up crocheting a few months ago, it‚Äôs pretty easy to learn how to do - taught myself through a few youtube tutorials - and you can make some cute things ranging from different clothing items/accessories, stuffed animals, blankets, etc.. it‚Äôs a nice coping mechanism to help calm you down and whatnot if you‚Äôre interested. taking a shower or warm bath helps too, to kind of give yourself time to digest your feelings and be away from everything else for a bit. taking a walk has helped as well, listening to music & going on a drive, doing makeup, spending time with a pet if you have any. checking my pulse has also helped ground me, or you can try rubbing your one arm with your opposite hand, kind of petting yourself almost. i have a lot of hope for you to get through this‚Ä¶ hopefully some of these suggestions can help. \n\ni am really sensitive. when i feel strong emotions, it is completely overwhelming, and i sometimes still catch myself with a compulsion to be self-destructive.. and i don‚Äôt know if that will ever fully go away. but everyday i fight that urge, i had to develop an angel on my shoulder to fight the devil on the other, so to speak. the urge is less frequent now, less loud, less intense. it *is possible* to combat this habit. it *is possible* to beat it. you need to redirect those feelings, or challenge them with others. you need to feel sympathy for yourself, not anger. your pain is not your fault - don‚Äôt let it be your defeat, don‚Äôt let it only be pain. let it be a tool, let it be a stepping stone, let it be your inspiration to do and be better. \n\ni believe in you. the next step is for you to believe in yourself. sending endless hugs and love. though i don‚Äôt know your story, i know how much someone has to hurt to turn to a habit like this. i hope you find the love that you deserve and the help that you need to break free of this habit.', 'I am there if you wanna talk.', 'I got red lines on my stomach.

This is especially if you start to focus on what you\'re  drawing rather than the thoughts in your head. Trees and flowers are my go to. \n\nIce. Press an icecube on where you want to harm. Its another sensation thing, but this sensation is much closer to pain. \n\nTIPP is a fantastic tool for doing a ""hard reset"" on your brain and stopping your train of thought or a downward spirl. Basically anything that makes  your brain stop.\n\nT= temperature- intense changes in temperature work beautifully. If you\'re in a cold climate, go stand outside for a bit barefoot. Jump in a cold shower. Basically anything that would you make you go ""holy fuck thats cold!"" Is good. I\'d avoid the heat direction because that does way more harm than good\n\nI= intense exercise. Have you ever tried having a panic attack while following a p90x video? Because you cant. It A.) Makes your body release endorphins, B.) Burns off some of that anxiety and adrenaline, C.) Forces you to get out of your head and focus on something outside your thoughts D.) What few thoughts you have remaining in your head will be ""wow! I hate this! Working out sucks!""

Hold till the count of 8. Breath out till the count of 8. Hold till the count of 8. It is *insanely* effective and very discreet, but it takes practice /when you aren\'t on the verge of a meltdown/ to master. \n\nP= Paired muscle relaxation. Our body affects our mood just like our mood affects our body.  When we\'re sore, we\'re cranky, when we are stressed we\'re tense- by changing one we change the other. Sit down and go through a mental scan of you body and force each section/ each muscle of your body to relax. Unclench your jaw, relax your shoulders, uncross your arms. There are ""body scan meditation"" videos on youtube to help you if you want guidance. Otherwise, take note of what your body does when you\'re stressed and when you start felling overwhelmed, actively avoid doing those. Another cool thing is that if you force yourself to smile, even if you are so far from happy, your brain still gives you a hit of that good ol\' serotonin. Its kind of like a manual good brain juice button. \n\nAnother super helpful tip is to engage the mammalian dive reflex. Basically, when our face is submerged in water for 10 seconds or more,  it slows down part of our nervous system that is tied in with panic to help us not drown. This effect happens whenever our face goes into water, even when we aren\'t at any risk of drowning, so just filling up your sink and dunking your face triggers it.\n\n\nAnd a gentle reminder:\n\nIt DOES get better.\nYou\'ve survived 100% of your bad days so far. \nThe best is yet to come.']"
Need Your Help in Reporting #cutforamber posts in Twitter showcasing Self-Harm,"&#x200B;

Self-harm philosophy,"Had a teen client with a self-harm history say that she doesn‚Äôt understand why non-life-threatening self-harm is considered ‚Äúbad.‚Äù She has experienced shaming statements made by previous healthcare professionals related to self-harm and is also someone who enjoys a good debate. Since this was brought up at the end of session, we agreed to pick up with this thought next time. I plan on having an open-ended and deeper discussion with her, but would love to hear some opinions about this!",18hudgn,67,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/18hudgn/selfharm_philosophy/,"[""My views appear to be at odds with others' opinions.   I have the opinion that self harm as a coping strategy is an unfortunate, undesirable behavior pattern.   \n\n\\--It can be progressive.   Minor self laceration of the nondominant arm/forearm doesn't always lead to more serious self harm but it certainly can.  While most folks' course of self injury is time-limited during adolescence, remitting in early adulthood, there is a subset of the population of self-injurers who are at-risk for an escalation of their self injurious behavior.   I've been in practice 34 years, worked in inpatient settings for much of that time, have been witness to quite serious self injury.  I think we do folks a disservice by not addressing this risk.\n\n\\--Motives for self injury vary but often there is a self-punitive theme.   Often there is shame and the person feels they need to cover up evidence of their self injury.  I don't feel that I'm doing them a service by downplaying the negative impact of self injury.\n\n\\--When someone uses self injury to cope it means that there are other strategies which they're not using.  These other strategies--conventional dbt skills, generally more mature coping skills--are more productive and helpful in the long run than self injury.\n\n\\--A pattern of self injury can certainly have features of an addictive process.  The endorphin release theory of self injury--which is only partially supported by research findings--is an aspect of the addictive theory.   Often the person does experience a compulsion, a loss of self control, a narrowing of coping options which leaves them feeling that they have little agency over whether or not to engage in the behavior.  In my opinion the behavior is not the product of a rational decision making process--as a mental health provider it's hard to endorse or positively reframe a scenario like that.\n\n\\--It tends to be a behavior done in secrecy, in isolation.  It can reinforce a sense of isolation, shame and withdrawal during times of stress.   I think it is in the person's best interest to view self injury as a coping strategy to be minimized and eventually extinguished.\n\nFor these reasons, I don't view self injury as a benign pattern, as if it's just an okay, nonconforming, unconventional but essentially fine thing to do."", ""I wouldn't look at it as bad, I would look at it as a coping mechanism. What need does the self harm address for them?"", 'I had a professor in grad school tell us that while we of course need to encourage our clients to use healthier alternatives to self-harm acknowledging that there are likely not going to be any alternatives that work as well as self harm does in terms of regulation. I think that acknowledgment is really important and validating for the client', 'I‚Äôm taking a training with Janina Fisher right now and she says something along the lines of self harm being an ingenious way to cope with depression as it produces adrenaline/endorphins. She is very upfront with clients about other coping mechanisms not having the same degree of relief (this is so important, our clients have to know this), but there are some other coping skills that can have a similar (though not as strong) effect, and won‚Äôt result in harm.', 'One perspective to consider is that it is addictive, and like most addictions you need increasing amounts to feel satisfied. This can lead to the behavior escalating to the point where it is life threatening or requires medical attention.', 'It‚Äôs overall mal-adaptive and often escalation is required to get the same endorphin pay off. Obviously, different physical consequences depending on type of self harm.', 'it‚Äôs a coping skill- it‚Äôs helping them cope. there‚Äôs nothing wrong or inherently ‚Äúbad‚Äù about any coping skills. they help us get through hard times the way we knew how at that time, and i‚Äôm happy for everyone who copes any way they know how and gets through something difficult!\n\n\n\nbut why are some coping skills called adaptive and some are called maladaptive? what‚Äôs the definition of each of those words, and is it subjective? like, do you and kiddo client agree/have the same definitions? would their parent/caregiver(s) agree with us? why or why not? i would also define maladaptive as ‚Äúsomething that can potentially cause harm‚Äù or something along the lines of not being without risk (and have before when this has come up).\n\n\n\ni use smoking cigarettes as an example too‚Äîso like smoking cigarettes is a coping skill that gets many people through many hard situations. if smoking cigarettes has helped people cope with like SI, then i am actually glad they utilized that coping skill. i‚Äôm glad that person is alive and i can‚Äôt say cigarettes are always 100% ‚Äúbad‚Äù if they can help this theoretical suicidal person not act on suicidal thoughts, etc. is smoking cigarettes an adaptive coping skill that we know for sure causes no harm and has little to no risk?', ""I like Janina Fisher's take on self harm and suicidality. https://janinafisher.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/selfharm.pdf"", 'What if you came at it with an IFS perspective. ‚ÄúYour self harm serves a purpose, and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre trying to tell me.‚Äù How about we find ways that aren‚Äôt so risky and serve the same purpose. It‚Äôs much more complicated than that, but here‚Äôs a start.', 'Someone once asked me if I knew anyone who was happy or well-adjusted who also self-harmed. It forced me to think about the function of it, which is largely rooted in self-hate.', 'Id also consider approaching it from a harm reduction angle - the ""problem"" might not inherently lie in self harming, but rather in the escalating pattern, the risk for complications such as infection (even really severe infections such as sepsis), and the lack of building up skills which are effective lifelong. Self harm can only go so far for coping, and when that reaches it\'s end, if you haven\'t developed the other tools for communication, emotional regulation, etc, then you will be left floundering and at higher risk of that self injury escalating to very serious wounds to try and cope.', ""I wouldn't tell them it's bad **morally**, but it definitely comes with risks and consequences, and like any self-mutilation (not done specifically for a desired aesthetic outcome, although sometimes even then the line can be a bit blurry), it comes with the symbolic charge that they need to mutilate their bodies in order to handle their moments of stress; and that's just not acceptable tradeoff (even leaving aside that it does nothing good to better the stress over the long term), the same way its not acceptable to sacrifice your mental health/integrity to take care of your body.\n\nI would also point out the incongruence that they're apparently claiming that it's an appropriate coping mechanism, when in reality they're still (and have been for years) needing to visit MH professionals, si clearly, at the very least, it's not even working that well.\n\nIME, people who've integrated and banalised self-harm to that extent, tend to be very grave and more resistant to working earnestly to get better overall. I won't comment much more on this from a theoretical PoV, because I'm the mention of comprehensive theories on personality structure have been rejected on this sub in favour or a view that phenomenology is everything, that patients are unique, and that these matters are for the most part non-systematisable and unknowable."", 'As a teenager I had a damaging experience where nobody took my mental health seriously and even an ER doctor examining my wounds said it was no big deal. It really depends on the person, but for some, people telling you that literally mutilating yourself is ""okay"" can normalize that degree of pain and suffering as something to shrug off.', 'When in doubt- I like the question of what meaning have you assigned to self harm?', 'I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else post this, but here‚Äôs a link to a paper that focuses on using a trauma informed lens on self harm behavior :) it‚Äôs a free pdf\n\nhttps://janinafisher.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/addictions.pdf', ""Motivational Interviewing helps here to discuss broadly about self-helf.

She asked if I would ever consider cutting the little girl I babysat, if I knew that it would help her calm down, couldn't find any other way that would work to help her regulate her emotions, and no one else would ever know about it. The answer of course was no. I would never ever in a million years cut this little girl that I loved to help her calm down, even if it worked better than the other ways I knew to soothe her, even if she'd been crying and screaming for three hours straight. So if I wanted to act with love towards myself, that meant no cutting, ever."", 'Well, let‚Äôs start with the basics. Here are some definitions. \n\nHarm: physical injury, especially that which is deliberately inflicted\n\nInjure: do physical harm or damage to (someone).\n\nDamage: physical harm caused to something in such a way as to impair its value, usefulness, or normal function.\n\nImpair: weaken or damage something (especially a human faculty or function)\n\nSelf-Harm: deliberate injury to oneself, typically as a manifestation of a mental condition.\n\nSo by definition, whether life-threatening or not, self-harm is considered an action intended to weaken the body. Weaken is generally a negative. People want to be stronger. \n\nBut what if the physical pain is what makes their body stronger? Well, is self-harm the only way to intentionally feel physical pain? No. Is it the only way to gain physical strength? No. There are healthier outlets like playing sports or dunking your face in ice water.\n\nBut what if self-harm is the only coping skill that ‚Äúworks‚Äù? Well, what are we defining as ‚Äúworking‚Äù? Is it the action that makes mental anguish lessen fastest? Is it the biggest distraction available? Is it a punishment? Is the scar it leaves proof of their suffering? Self-harm definitely serves a purpose. Is it the only option though? Is it the best choice? Is it the choice you will look back on proudly? As a teen it‚Äôs hard to say. \n\nLet‚Äôs try to think ahead though. Have you ever met an adult with self-harm scars? Have you ever asked them how they feel about them? Have you ever asked if they still do it?\n\nI can‚Äôt speak for every adult, but in my experience I feel shame, sadness, and compassion when I look at my scars. They are not something I‚Äôm proud of, but also not something I hide. Do I regret self-harming? No. I understand the purpose it served me. I still get urges, but instead of acting on them I use them as a signal to know something is bothering me and has to be dealt with. Self-harm is not something I would ever recommend to someone else though. \n\nLet‚Äôs pivot and think of body modification for a minute. Have you ever heard someone describe getting a tattoo or piercing as self-harm? It certainly can be, but in most cases it is not. The difference is the intention. A tattoo or piercing usually involves some advance planning and thought. It is something a person finds meaningful - even if that meaning is just that it looks cool. When someone self-harms what are their intentions? Are they deliberately trying to alter their body for a purpose, or is their intention physical pain? Most people would say physical pain is bad.\n\nAt the end of the day, other people will consider non-life-threatening self-harm ‚Äúbad‚Äù whether you want them to or not. It is not a long term health seeking behavior. Chances are you wouldn‚Äôt tell your friend to try cutting the next time they‚Äôre upset, right?\n\nOne last thing. Picture a line with ‚Äúbad‚Äù on one end and ‚Äúgood‚Äù on the other. Where would you place non-suicidal self-harm for yourself? Where would you place it for your younger self and older self? What about for friends, acquaintances, people in general? How far from ‚Äúgood‚Äù does something have to be for it to become ‚Äúbad‚Äù? Do you think other people would place things similarly or differently from how you did? Realistically, is self-harm something that could be considered neutral?', 'As a therapist who self-harmed for 10 years (never while I‚Äôve been practicing)‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs anything inherently ‚Äúbad‚Äù about it at all‚Ä¶ just like other forms of body modification/aesthetic procedures, there could be risks such as infection or scarring, or of course if the cutting is deep enough the risk of serious bleeding or accidental death‚Ä¶. But it doesn‚Äôt sound like it is deep‚Ä¶ for myself I had to have my own reasons for stopping‚Ä¶ I definitely don‚Äôt think telling a client they ‚Äúneed‚Äù to stop simply because it‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù is good practice at all.', ""It's not bad, it's ineffective. It only works short term and causes bodily injury. There are more effective ways for regulating emotions that don't cause tissue damage"", 'Sometimes people accidentally kill themselves when they self harm.', 'I knew someone that self harmed and it was a cry for help even though they denied it. It‚Äôs bad because scars can get infected or you can make the mistake of cutting too much, where you need stitches or it will keep bleeding. Also, the scars could be permanent if the person keeps it up.', ""Desperate people do desperate things when their *nerves are on fire*.  When one is suffering the consequences in the long run are irrelevant = warnings are useless.  \n\nSome wound up people can find harmless relief by plunging their hands in bathroom sinks full of ice and water.   Once rapport develops a teenage girl can be asked if she intends to wear a long sleeve dress at her high school graduation.   It's worth a try.""]"

"Do not play support in Solo Q, it is self-harm","To prove I have the right to say anything, here are my stats

I have played WR since season 2, and 90% of my games are support. My summary is, don't play support in Solo Q unless you want to troll yourself. The amount of effort you try to carry is unrewarded, especially in this season. As a support, you are trying to help your team get kills/ protect them and provide impacts across the map, but not in Solo. 

&#x200B;

As Broken Support said, Solo Q is Mario party and 90% of the players have zero game sense, you are supporting a group of Monkys to calculate E= mc\^2. Your team will only cry: We need a tank, we need a tank, so they can do the dumbest thing you can ever imagine

&#x200B;

Tell me what you can do when:

&#x200B;

\- As an Alister in the team fight, you knock up 3 enemy carries, stun the 10/1 enemy ADC and tank more than 15s. Your whole team, literally 4 of them are attacking Ornn and letting the carries due free damage?

\- As a Nami, your team is 10 - 35. You ult and stole the Baron and the rest of your team go to ARAM mode and run it down in mid, when there is no Turrent in mid, and the Jungle is still farm for the next game? Can you push the side lane? Yes, your screen will turn grey very soon

&#x200B;

I can give an endless amount of examples from my >5k support games

&#x200B;

Can you carry as a support? Yes, go play Pkye, but then you can carry even better to play another role. If you really like the support role, go find one or two teammates to play with you.

OOP (54M) wife‚Äôs (53F) son (12M) is suffering. He self-harms and claims that my wife is emotionally abusing him. OOP asks what to do,"Triggerwarning: abuse, mentions self-harm 

Edit: I am not OOP

# [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/v96rov/my_54m_wifes_53f_son_12m_is_suffering_he/): My (54M) wife‚Äôs (53F) son (12M) is suffering. He self-harms and claims that my wife is emotionally abusing him. What do I do?

So, my family life is a mess, to put it lightly, and I‚Äôm not innocent to that. My wife and I grew apart while our daughters (now 24F and 26F) were in their preteens/early teens. We never really talked about it in detail, but I think we both knew that we were staying together for the kids. She once said while we were fighting that she couldn‚Äôt wait for our youngest to leave home so we could divorce. Then she came home pregnant with another kid, years after the last time we‚Äôd last been intimate.

I honestly should have divorced her. I regret not doing it now. The truth is, I didn‚Äôt want to bring that messiness into my relationships with my daughters, and even once they moved out, I was comfortable just not being home a lot. I have other places I can be, and fewer chores and no alimony and child support kind of felt like it was worth the fighting, or at least close enough to worth it that I wasn‚Äôt eager to go through the divorce process. We‚Äôre basically roommates who wear wedding rings and yell at each other.

I‚Äôll also admit that I didn‚Äôt get to know my wife‚Äôs son very well. It always felt like he was her thing, I just looked after him when she asked me to. He‚Äôs not a very endearing kid- quiet, grumpy, weird, used to take apart every device he could get his hands on, not very well-behaved in general.

Anyhow, this weekend, I found out that he‚Äôs been suffering. I wanted to go fishing and the wife wanted to not have to deal with him, so I took him with me. He insisted on wearing a hoodie even though it was hot, and I took it off him when he started showing signs of heat stroke and still wanted to keep it on. That‚Äôs how I ended up seeing the scars on his wrist. There‚Äôs only a couple and they‚Äôre fairly fresh.

I was pretty shook up by that. At first he wouldn‚Äôt tell me anything. Maybe twenty or thirty minutes later, he really spilled guts to me. He has no friends, the other kids pick on him, typical kid stuff. And then he goes on about what my wife‚Äôs said to him. She‚Äôs said that he‚Äôs an embarrassment, that she wishes he‚Äôd never been born so she could have run away with her affair partner, that he‚Äôs the reason she lost her job, that he‚Äôll never amount to anything like his sisters did, that there‚Äôs a reason the other kids pick on him, and so on. She insults everything he likes just to hurt him and mocks him for showing sadness. He hates seeing us interact with his half-sisters because he knows he‚Äôll never have anything like that (never be loved like that? I don't know what he meant). He wishes he could just never feel anything again.

So, I held the kid and told him that none of that was true and that I‚Äôd talk to her, and that I'd make sure something would change.

I haven‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know how, and I know it‚Äôs going to be a bloody mess when I do. I tried to talk to her son again, but he‚Äôs not interested in talking. He says he made a mistake (in talking to me, presumably) because of the heat (under which his mind wasn‚Äôt as sharp as usual, he probably means), that he's fine and should just forget about it.

I don‚Äôt know what to do for this kid. I‚Äôm scared that he‚Äôll kill himself unless something is done. Aside from the self-harm, he just comes off as really emotionally dead.

TLRD: My wife's son is miserable and I don't know what to do about it.

\*\*\*

 The comments understably did not go easy on OOP. Initially his replies were worrying as he didn't seem to grasp his part in it and even saying he didn't really like the kid  


But then, he posted a happy (or, as happy as this situation could go) [Update 22 days later](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vnxm37/update_my_54m_wifes_53f_son_12m_is_suffering_hes/):

&#x200B;

**UPDATE: My (54M) wife‚Äôs (53F) son (12M) is suffering. He‚Äôs self-harming and claims my wife is verbally abusing him. What do I do?**

  
For those who didn‚Äôt read the first post, here‚Äôs the situation as of a month ago: I was disengaged from my family. I had fallen out of love with my wife years ago and was putting off divorce for no real reason. She had had a child with someone else, and I had little involvement with the child because all three of us thought of him as exclusively hers. I was not spending much time at home in general due to feeling ill at ease there due to frequent arguments. Then, I found out that the child was doing very badly. His mother was verbally abusing him, he was friendless and bullied, and he was self-harming. This was shocking to me and I sought advice on Reddit as to how to help him.  
Here‚Äôs what happened after the first post:  
I served my wife the divorce papers within a week of him telling me about the abuse, having made a decision to raise him myself. There was screaming, name-calling, and blaming going both directions and a massive fight over who should leave, but in the end she packed her bags and left. I went to my son to tell him that I‚Äôd divorced her because I didn‚Äôt want to be with someone who treated a kid so badly, and that she wouldn‚Äôt be living with us anymore. He said, ‚Äúokay.‚Äù I asked him how he felt about that and he shrugged.  
The divorce itself is looking like it‚Äôs going to be as much of a financial and practical nightmare as I imagined it, but she didn‚Äôt want custody of our son, so that won‚Äôt be a fight.  
Emotionally, the divorce makes me feel nothing. I was angry at first, but I feel at home in my own house for the first time in years. It‚Äôs definitely worth it. I have tried to talk to my ex-wife about our son, but she says it‚Äôs not her problem anymore. I have a feeling that we will talk almost exclusively about legal matters in the future.  
As for how my son is doing, well, I guess things are improving. I contacted a child psychologist, and while there was a bit of a waiting list, he‚Äôs going to start therapy in two weeks. He also finished the 7th grade, and I found out that he has really high marks- like, high 90s in every class but gym. As well, he‚Äôs going into high school next year, and I‚Äôm letting him choose the school. He‚Äôs choosing one away from his old peer group, unsurprisingly.  
Unsurprisingly, given how little time has passed and the state he was in to begin with, he‚Äôs pretty maladjusted. He‚Äôs understandably very upset about not seeing his mother anymore. He hasn‚Äôt said as much (he doesn‚Äôt talk to me about his feelings much in general), but my guess is that he still loved his mom even though she was abusing him. He also has some antisocial views that I‚Äôll get to later.  
But... we‚Äôve had a few good times. One of the Redditors here suggested that we get some old electronics and take them apart together, and we had a great time doing that. He‚Äôs also introduced me to his video games. And he likes rambling about things and researching things: aside from machines and his games, he knows more about genetics than I do. He‚Äôs actually pretty cool.  
The antisocial views: I got him into this STEM club and asked him if he was talking to anyone there after his first (thus far only) meeting. He said no, he doesn‚Äôt need friends. We talked about what he meant and he made some weird comments about how he didn‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs love or kindness. I was tempted to remind him that he‚Äôd cried over the lack of those things to me two weeks ago, but I didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what to do with him thinking like that, but it doesn‚Äôt seem healthy. I want him to make friends.  
I asked him recently if he‚Äôs doing better than he was a month ago. He said yes. I know it‚Äôs going to be an uphill battle to unfuck this kid, but I think it‚Äôs going okay so far? Any suggestions?  
TLDR: he‚Äôs away from his mother, I‚Äôm doing my best with him, and he seems to be doing marginally better.",vq7lcx,8664,553,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/vq7lcx/oop_54m_wifes_53f_son_12m_is_suffering_he/,"[""#Please read our [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/wiki/subrules) before commenting or your comment may be removed.\n\nMost submissions in this sub are not posted by the original author (OOP).

Cmv: The argument of body autonomy from abortion extends to the legalisation self-harming drugs,"In my view, the most compelling reason to support strong abortion rights is the principle of bodily autonomy. I believe that the core issue in abortion rights should be the fundamental right to control one's own body and life. Additionally, I argue that this reasoning should also apply to the personal choice of using self-harmful drugs. At a minimum, these drugs should be considered on the same level as alcohol, which is widely accepted despite its potential for harm. While alcohol's widespread use and cultural integration may partly explain its statistically significant impact for garming non consumers, it's misleading to claim that alcohol is less harmful than some illegal drugs like marijuana or hallucinogens to those not directly consuming it.",18bncyd,95,570,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18bncyd/cmv_the_argument_of_body_autonomy_from_abortion/,"[""/u/hakezzz (OP) has awarded 4 delta(s) in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/18bnr3o/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_the_argument_of_body/), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\xa0System\xa0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)"", '[removed]', 'I would agree that some drugs are over-regulated, but there certainly are narcotics that should remain unlawful to distribute.

Based on that, even if you grant that the fetus is a person, it‚Äôs rights still would not supersede the rights of the mother.  It is similar to not requiring blood or organ donations.  \n\nDrug use is the argument that we should be allowed to do things even if they are bad for us.  Outlawing these things is a required inaction (don‚Äôt do drugs)as opposed to a required action (carry a baby to term).  It takes a choice off the table instead of making the decision for you.  We allow this for many things with differing levels of regulation (hopefully) based on societal costs or ease of mitigation (like seat belts).  You can certainly make the argument that drugs should be elsewhere on this regulation spectrum, but it is a very different argument than used for abortion.', 'It‚Äôs important to note that most pro-choice people are not absolutists when it comes to the principle of bodily autonomy.

Abortion is very autonomy-focused, because it concerns a person's right to terminate a process that causes permanent changes to their body and life.  Beneficence also is important because abortion is sometimes necessary to secure a patient's well-being and livelihood.  Non-maleficence is usually not as much of a concern, because abortion is a very safe procedure though it still needs to be accounted for to a small degree.  Justice is also a concern when abortion access is not evenly or fairly distributed in a population.  Hence autonomy and beneficence are the primary arguments when it comes to abortion access.\n\nWhen it comes to drugs... yes, there is indeed a case for autonomy, but as with abortion it is not the *only* metric that needs to be considered.  Uncontrolled drug use and the potential for addiction can be very medically and socially harmful, and hence issues of beneficence and non-maleficence tend to counterbalance if not largely outweigh the metric of autonomy in this instance.  Justice is also a concern because drug addiction tends to be particularly harmful for certain demographics, i.e. low-income.\n\nEvery bioethical issue needs to be evaluated independently and holistically based on a multitude of metrics, not just autonomy."", 'We already have thousands of fully legal self harm drugs.

Covered in self-harm scars,"When I was a teenager through my early 20s, (I'm in my mid-20s now), I practiced a lot of self-injury. I've been training muay thai for about 4 years now, and it seems like if I ever wear anything slightly revealing people ask me what happened. To me, this is super rude and intrusive, but I get that people probably don't realize what they are bringing up. I usually just lie. Normally I wear a long sleeved rash guard and long shorts to cover up, which works, but still leaves me discouraged training with other people.

"As of September 30th, 2019, I am officially three years self-harm free."," My last self-harming took place on September 30th, 2016. I was, *am* a cutter. I suppose I always will be, in typical addict fashion, but I have been *""clean""*  for three years now. Typically to my forearms. I started when I was a  child, but if you asked me directly when, I couldn't tell you. I didn't  wear them proudly, or 'for attention'. I constantly wore long sleeves,  and still do to hide my scars -- even in 40C weather. It's not something  I'm proud of, and my family is oblivious, even though I'm now in my  thirties. I managed to hide the scars, and my habit well. I often  required stitches when I went 'too far'. I often contemplated getting  full sleeve tattoos, as I've heard of some self-harmers getting sleeve  tattoos because they 'didn't want to self-harm and ruin their tattoos'.  However, I didn't trust myself enough not to pay the funds for the  tattoos, only to mark them up, or start marking my thighs instead to  avoid ruining the ink.

I wish you all the peace, self love and many ""clean"" years to come!', ""I'm so proud of you"", 'I\'m proud of you for being able to go three years without cutting. My first suicide attempt was in third grade. I\'ve had others since then, but I also used to choke myself and then when I was fifteen and started a relationship with a guy, who was pretty shitty he got me to stop choking myself. However, he\'d often get mad at me if I felt like committing suicide, and instead of harming myself I drew. I also would say ""I\'ve been good,"" to help let myself know it\'s been awhile since I\'ve part choked myself. I understand how parents can be oblivious to it, as my mom would yell at me, and because I was behind a computer screen choking myself, she didn\'t notice. Later when I mentioned it, she started making fun of me for it. So, it depends if you trust your parents to be supportive or not. I\'d hope they would be supportive in the fact that you\'ve stopped cutting. I hope you can continue to stop cutting, it\'s okay to still want to, it\'s been six years since I\'ve stopped choking myself and I still want to at times. As long as you can do something to get your mind off of it, that\'s what matters. I want you to continue to no longer harm yourself. I still will plan out ways to commit suicide at times, but I don\'t follow through, usually because I feel like I\'ll just become a lot of hospital bills, if it doesn\'t work. Which isn\'t great, do better than me on that aspect. However, I also still try to draw or write poetry. \nIf you have an outlet to get your mind a bit distracted from it, please do what you can. I\'m sorry if I droned on a bit about myself, I just want you to know there are people who may be able to understand where you\'re coming from. Also, I hope if not all, but most people would be supportive in the fact that you\'ve come so far from where you were three years ago. If you could go to therapy, it may be good. When I went to college, I kept being told I should go to counseling, and eventually I did, but during a panic attack the counselor did give up on me. However, when they almost took me out on medical leave, I was given the option of going to a therapist, after not going to classes for the rest of the week. I did that, and it helped a bit. I also, realized I was pushing myself in counseling to say too much about shitty things in my past, instead of letting it come naturally. \n\nIf anything, try therapy if you\'d like, if the first therapist doesn\'t feel right, try to see what others are available around you and see them. I\'ve been with my therapist for seven months, and it\'s been useful. Also, it\'s okay to break in front of them, when mentioning about a panic attack and how it came up due to a moment of remembering when my mom was hitting me, he tried to help me through that moment. There is still quite a bit I haven\'t mentioned, but also it needs to come naturally, not forced. Let yourself, be okay with mentioning your past and present, never force it out. I hope if you try it, your therapist will be great for you. \n\nAgain, I\'m proud of you for making it this far without cutting, if you ever want a tattoo, even if it\'s not on your arms, maybe get one that resembles your hardship through when you were cutting and after you stopped.

TW: Ayesha and self-harm due to Bhai's bashing,"Building on u/AyuuonReddit's post. Showing Ayesha harming herself on TV would cross many legal boundaries. Let's talk about the first and the most important one:

1. Banijay and EndemolShine getting backlash: A self-harm attempt on a show in any other country is enough to get the show banned for life. India is more easy going and allows this crap to happen. Had makers not edited this, it would have brought immense disrepute to the production house and format in general.

2. There is a self-harm attempt on a show and the show is allowed to go on as if nothing happened? This will raise eyebrows everywhere. So creatives played smart brought back Ayesha so it seems she came willingly (Rs 2 crore clause could have played a role in reality)

3. This is not the first time this has happened. Fun fact (and very few people know this) in season 4 Dolly Bindra had physically assaulted Sameer Soni (Neelam Kothari's husband) with a gym rod and none of it was shown on TV (because Dolly was good for TRPs). She wasn't even evicted till Sameer protested.

And I repeat. ANURAG WAS SHIVERING. CHINTU who is usually bindaas was losing control of his hands.

And why do you think Ankita was suddenly talking about SSR?

It all adds up.

Self-harm on boobs?,"Hi, I was really hesitant about posting on here but I figured I needed to ask someone and from what I can find, there is nothing on google that answers this question.

I got diagnosed with depression when I was 13, I am 16 now and when the therapist that I went to see (briefly) asked me if I self-harmed, I said no. But now I'm not so sure.

Since I started feeling the effects of depression, I have been severely picking and cutting my boobs specifically, no where else, just my boobs. When I imagine self-harm, and I of course don't want to be triggering by saying this, I imagine injury of the arms or thighs. Is it self-harm for me to cut and scar my boobs? I am completely aware of what I'm doing but I can't help it, so if it is considered self-harm, if anyone knows any ways that might help me try and stop it would be greatly appreciated.",10kem70,146,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/10kem70/selfharm_on_boobs/,"[""It is self harm.\n\nIf you consciously and purposely decide to hurt yourself, it is considered self harm. Doesn't matter if it leaves a scar, bruise or nothing at all. You intentionally hurt yourself = SH.\n\nThere are many skills you can apply for harm reduction/stopping.\n\nFirst, you should ask yourself _why_ you do it. Self harm isn't just learned behavior. It's a reaction to an underlying issue. You mentioned it came as a result of your depression, so go into it further. \n\nWhat exactly moved you to start to begin with and why do you keep doing it? Is it addictive? Is it a punishment? Etc.\n\nGrounding skills refer to any activity that snaps you out of your current (negative) mood. It can be anything. Listening to happy music, taking a cold shower, changing your posture, drawing... they're all ways to _remove_ and _distance_ yourself from the mood you find yourself stuck in.\n\nThere are also more direct ways to help with urges. Some people use smelling salts, acupuncture balls, fidget toys, a rubberband to flick on your wrist, eating spicy candy/food, using self heating ointments...etc. These serve more as actual sensations to keep yourself mentally grounded.\n\nAll of those skills are valid and there are many more that you can simply look up online. From here, it's basically a trial and error type of thing. Some skills will help you, others wont. But trust me when I say that you _will_ find effective distractions eventually. And you absolutely can improve and get over this.\n\n Nobody has ever regret recovery."", ""It is selfharm what you're doing, yes.

Easier to hide or that you hate them? I think this is something you should discuss with your therapist to understand yourself better."", ""Yes it is self harm, you're still injuring yourself, no matter where it is.

My husband says that self-harm is attention seeking,"Yesterday when I was changing my husband walked into the bedroom and he saw the fresh cuts all over my legs.

Some people are raised ‚Äútough‚Äù to think that bad mental health is a weakness and to be frowned upon (in a bad way). You could try to explain to him what it feels like to be you.\n\n\nBut the fact that he just yells at you and belittles you instead of jumping in to help, says a lot about his character. Even my Dad, who was raised to not show emotional weakness, showed compassion for me when he saw my cuts all over my stomach and nowadays arms too. \n\n\nI get the feeling that he is not going to change his stance on this and will only make you feel worse about yourself.

I work in academia and the sooner the system falls apart the better. Its in a similar boat to the NHS, running on fumes and the goodwill of thousands of completely and utterly burnt out staff earning a fraction of what their skills and qualifications should entail.', ""This is jaw dropping to me. One of the biggest things my university was concerned about post Brexit was the sudden loss of foreign students. Many, if not most, universities need a certain level of foreign students and their higher education costs (morality of that up to you) to continue operating as is.\n\nForeign students provide a significant portion of their cash flow, and allow them to provide things for their students they couldn't afford with just local students. We had a big issue that resulted in massive cuts to quality on the campus because the massive lack of international students resulted in massive quality cuts, contracts not-reupped for service providers, and departments being combined and space taken away from others. COVID student numbers compounded this. \n\nNow, some of this, or a lot of it, may have been simply due to greed and was inevitable. But, when your yearly budget suddenly loses a massive portion of your high paying students, you start making cuts."", 'At a time when the higher education sector is struggling and desperate for income, let‚Äôs take the one thing they make a decent profit on, and destroy it. What could possibly go wrong?', 'Is all‚Ä¶. this stuff the tories are doing basically just a scorched earth policy?  Salting the earth for those who follow?', 'Afternoon. Let‚Äôs take another journey on the idiot carousel. Yes, I feel dizzy too. Yes, I also want to get off. But we can‚Äôt. We‚Äôre all trapped here, in the place where the laughter long ago turned to screaming.\n\nYou can always trust them to come up with the stupidest possible idea and by god they‚Äôve done it again. The latest act of national hara-kiri from the Government involves a crackdown on foreign students. They‚Äôll either be barred from applying to top universities or face new restrictions on bringing dependents with them. Or perhaps both. Shit, why not? Throw the kitchen sink at it. And then find some other isolated areas of policy success that we can sabotage.\n\nThe Home Secretary thinks we need ‚Äúa more discerning, smart approach to the number of student visas‚Äù. The Prime Minister says ‚Äúall options‚Äù are on the table. The immigration figures came out yesterday, you see, and they were pretty high. That‚Äôs largely because of schemes to help those from Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghanistan, but also because of lots of foreign students arriving. A record high of 476,000 came in the year to September.\n\n**Idiot or liar?**\n\nForeign students are one of the last groups you would target with extra immigration restrictions. Don‚Äôt even bother considering the moral aspect. Just as a public relations exercise it‚Äôs completely counter-productive. The public don‚Äôt consider foreign students immigrants and are surprised when they find out they‚Äôre even included in the immigration figures. According to researchers, they typically react with ‚Äúsurprise and even bafflement‚Äù when they‚Äôre told that they are.\n\nIndeed, the Government feels the same way. The high student numbers which apparently so horrified ministers are the result of a concerted strategy by the Department for Education and the Department for International Trade. They aim to increase the value of Britain‚Äôs education exports to ¬£35bn per year and the number of international students hosted in the UK to at least 600,000 per year by 2030.\n\nYes, that‚Äôs right. The numbers which have so startled ministers are the numbers they have literally been aiming to achieve. All of which leads us back to the primary political question of the post-2016 era: idiot or liar? Are they so foolish they don‚Äôt know about their own target, or so deceptive they‚Äôre prepared to pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist?\n\n**A win ‚Äì in every possible way**\n\n‚ÄúThe internationalisation of education is vital,‚Äù the Government‚Äôs official International Education Strategy reads. ‚ÄúIt will support the recovery and growth of this sector as well as help realise the many economic benefits that education exports bring to the UK. The networks created help the UK forge lasting relationships with countries around the world and strengthen our Global Britain agenda.‚Äù\n\nExisting data suggests international students contribute nearly ¬£30bn annually to the UK economy. Typically speaking, they leave after the end of their study ‚Äì 61 per cent of non-EU students do so. Others will use the routes provided by the Government to seek work in the UK after they finish their course. Graduates get two years, PhD students get three. And if they find that work, they will contribute even more to the economy.\n\nConsider for a moment who this person is. They were educated somewhere else, so the UK did not pay for that. They take a degree in a British institution, which can charge very high fees for doing so, boosting the domestic economy and the institution itself. They are therefore likely to be wealthy, highly educated and have a warm view of the country in which they‚Äôve now spent their formative university years. And now they are going to become a taxpayer. It‚Äôs a win, in every possible way, from every possible angle. The kind of thing confident, successful, open countries celebrate.\n\n**Frowns in the rain**\n\nExcept the Government doesn‚Äôt want us to be that country. It wants us to be the other one. You know the one. The one which frowns in the rain. The one hooked on the anti-immigration drug. And that is the approach which this Government feels the need to adopt.', 'All this shows is the government have absolutely no clue how to control migration. However, the net migration of 500k is only larger than normal due to Ukrainian refugees we took in and the increase of foreign students since lockdowns ended.', 'What the government say and what they do about immigration are not the same.

I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb here and I‚Äôll be downvoted but here it goes:\n\nSome of those students deserves those jobs than some of the useless native students simply trying to get some of that student finance.', ""Most students return home after studying as it is, those who do not are the skilled employees we want and need. Neither of those are bad things but the Tories would do anything to have you believe otherwise. If the Tories really want to cut the number of foreign students then they should be funding universities to the point that they do not have to rely on them for money to keep running as they are. As with many of our current issues, this one is self-inflicted by the Tories. They cut university funding so universities focused on international recruitment to plug the funding gap. If the Tories really wanted to reverse that then they only have to increase university funding again, it's a simple fix but they will never consider it."", ""Foreign students are basically free money and publicity, it's spectacularly stupid but hey, gotta appease the racists somehow so they don't split the tory vote."", 'Of course it is, but unfortunately it appeals to their target audience right now who seem to be lapping up the ‚Äúforeign invasion‚Äù bullshit we‚Äôve been sold as a distraction almost non-stop since Sunak was handed power.', 'How, how in an era when we have more educated people than ever, did we end up with morons like her in charge?', 'They seem to be intent on driving this country into the ground. At what point does stopping them become self-defence?', ""I got the impression that it is simply to reduce immigration figures, however it also deprives us of the enhanced fees they have to pay and doesn't alter the number of people arriving in boats who then end up costing us money in processing/accommodation.  \nAlthough it may free up accommodation during what is pretty much an accommodation emergency."", 'Someone tell me how this bitch looks her mum and dad in the eye?', 'My uncle worked at a prestigious university and he was asked to give overseas students the benefit of the doubt when it came to marking. Simply for the purpose of being to give them a higher grade.\n\nHe said to me that he left his job because of that reason.

My sister-in-law (21F) refuses to let me (18F) see my nephew due to my self-harm scars,"My brother, who is 22 years old, met his now wife when he was 17. They got married right after my sister-in-law got pregnant which was 2 years ago. I admired my sister-in-law from the very first time that I met her. She's sweet and kind, she knows what she wants and is a stubborn person but I always thought that it's one of the best things about her.

When my nephew was born I was in a bad place mentally. I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia but at that time I didn't know what was wrong with me. I also struggled with self-harm big time, to the point in which my whole body was covered in cuts.

I remember the first time I got to hold my nephew. My arms were stinging so badly, but once I looked into his eyes it became one of my favorite memories. 

I always tried to keep to myself, and never told anyone about my problems. I just didn't want to make them as miserable as me I guess.

Four days ago I decided to come clean (no pun intended) since soon it's summer and I didn't plan on walking around in long sleeved shirts again. My mom cried, and it turned into this whole big thing which I was trying to avoid, but I was glad to have their support.

My sister-in-law was awfully quiet throughout the whole thing. Once I finally got to break out of my mother's embrace, I went to talk to her. That's when she sprung up from her seat, took my nephew, and told my brother they need to go.

My brother protested at first, but she convinced him they have some important stuff to do back home. I felt so awkward, and so hurt because of it, but I kept making excuses for her. I swear that when she looked back at me, she looked repulsed and disgusted.

I texted her after some time. She left me on read. So I tried calling her, or my brother. Neither of them picked up, or replied to my messages.

That was until seven hours ago. My sister-in-law sent me a quite short text, which I'm embarrassed to admit made me cried on hours on end. 
It's translated from my language so some things may not make sense.

""Sorry for responding so late, but I needed to sort everything out in my head and think about what to do next. Words can't express how sorry I am for your mental struggles and scars. You are truly a strong person, and I admire your resilience. It pains me to say this, but I think it's best if we limit contact. Your scars are a part of you, and I have no right to ask you to hide them, so you shouldn't see (my nephew's name) anymore. If he's exposed to such negative behaviors from a young age, there's a chance he might want to try them himself. Please don't hold any grudges against me; you must understand that my son's well-being is more important than anything else.""

I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell my family, because I know they'll start overreacting and make my sister-in-law do something she doesn't feel comfortable doing.

I'm not a mother, so maybe I just can't understand this, but I don't think that what she did is fair. I love my nephew so much, and the thought of not being here to see him grow up makes me sick. I honestly don't know what to do.

How do I get her to change her mind?

My scars don‚Äôt glorify the behaviour and I know for a fact whether the the kids ask me, my brother or my SIL the answer will be age appropriate and compassionate. None of us will glorify what I‚Äôve done or say it‚Äôs normal for everyone. Everyone knows I‚Äôm not a danger to anyone except maybe myself at times, and those are times I wouldn‚Äôt go see my nieflings anyway.\n\nAs above, the oldest is 7, has seen my scars many times and has not yet asked. It hasn‚Äôt affected her or her siblings because she has seen these scars on me since she was born. They‚Äôre not even a question to her, just like they won‚Äôt be to your nieflings, unless they don‚Äôt know you. Honestly I‚Äôve had these scars out  for over a decade now and literally one person ever has mentioned them (and they were somehow using them as a reason for me to date them, because they could ‚Äúsee‚Äù me).

That it‚Äôs something that will be explained when the kid asks AND when they‚Äôre at the age they (the parents) deem it appropriate. Kids aren‚Äôt scared of stuff they see like that as long as it‚Äôs handled appropriately.\n\nI think the most important thing you can do is go through this with a therapist. The therapist can give you help writing the letter and also help you if it doesn‚Äôt have the effect. If the therapist is willing then maybe you could add their number for your brother and his wife to call with any concerns.

Try not to be too mad at her for this immediate reaction, hopefully with a bit of education/ time to process she will relent and be less scared.

You made a good decision telling your family. Keeping ourselves healthy is difficult. It's even harder for people with brain disorders such as yourself. You will need all the support you can get through your life. \n\nTalk to your doctors about good resources for your family to understand your illness and how to best support you. My guess is your mom will jump on that, encourage your brother to as well. \n\nTypically, maintaining good mental health is a lifelong process and constantly changing. You may not be aware that your illness is not under control and will need the support, guidance and trust of your family to help at these times. This is why they need to be educated. \n\nAs to your s-I-l.\nIt is completely normal and understandable that you are hurt by her reaction and devastated by the idea of not seeing your nephew. This is a loss for both you and he. You need to allow yourself to mourn. \n\n\nThis is a big shock to her and will take some time for her to process it all. \nTry to keep the doors of communication open with her. Continue to pursue the other aspects of your relationship with her. As she reconciles this new information with who she knows you to be, hopefully her thinking will also change. \n\n\nAs a mom, I get the desire to protect your child. It's a constant battle between letting a child have the experiences necessary to become an emotionally, mentally and physically strong adult and protecting them from the hazards of those experiences. You can't learn to walk, without falling on your knees or bumping your head. You can learn to walk without falling down the stairs. \n\n\nIn several months, when you are rested and emotionally strong, you may want to ask her if there are certain boundaries you two could establish so she will feel comfortable with you and your nephew seeing one another. This should include what information to share if he asks questions. \n\nDon't ask for a decision right then but ask her to please think about it and get back to you.  \n\n\nBut if she doesn't compromise, this is not your fault. This will be difficult for the whole family, but probably hardest for you.  Sometimes good people have blinders that hurt others. You will need to mourn the loss of your nephew and the change in your relationship with your SIL.  \n\n\nChoosing to be honest with the adults in your life who you trust and who love you is very healthy. Unfortunately, not everyone will respond as we hope. \nAnd you won't be able to force anyone to change their opinion. \n\nNow that you are allowing your scars to show, you do want to think about what information to share with other people.  For kids, just acknowledge the scars and point out they don't hurt anymore. Most won't ask anything beyond that. \nIf someone notices that they are unusual, keep the explanation simple- I got them during a difficult time in life but I'm healing. \n\nMuch love to you.

I‚Äôd chalk it down to stress, not feeling worthy enough, loss of friendships, feeling like I‚Äôd messed everything up and things like that.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2a5z3/)\nHow often do you get the urge? I self harmed, still get the urge sometimes. How do you suppress it?|It depends. There are times where I can go months without getting an urge. Then other times I might have a week where I get urges every single day, multiple times a day. It varies!  I usually suppress the urges but doing things to things to distract my mind and calm my thoughts. Things like dancing around my house and being energetic, meditating, doing arts and crafts or calling a friend. Recently I‚Äôve been really into doing diamond art, I don‚Äôt care how lame or basic that makes me sound! It‚Äôs very relaxing and it allows me to focus on something else.  I‚Äôm so sorry to hear you‚Äôve had experiences with self harm. I hope you‚Äôre doing okay now!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2a6yj/)\nSorry for all the questions What did you do to harm yourself?  How does it feel after harming yourself?  How was your first experience with it?  Did anyone ever find out?  What would you say to people who are in your old situation now?|Don‚Äôt apologise for asking a few questions. It‚Äôs all good, I am happy to answer them! So please don‚Äôt apologise!! :)  1. I had a few methods that I‚Äôd switch between. Most of the time I would cut myself with blades I would pull out of a razor. Sometimes I would dig my fingernails into the palm of my hands or into my thighs. I still find myself doing that quite a bit (especially lately because of anxiety) but 99% of the time I am able to stop myself before I do any kind of damage. And I would very rarely burn myself using a lighter or curling iron, but I‚Äôve only used that method a handful of times.  2. It probably makes me sound crazy (Ugh, I hate that word) but it felt good sometimes? It felt calm though too? Like it felt good to release pent up emotions/feelings. It never physically hurt me/caused me pain though. A lot of times I would end up feeling hints regret afterwards though and feelings of ‚ÄúOh my god, what did I do?!‚Äù  3. I don‚Äôt exactly remember, to be honest. It was, I think, 9 years ago now and I kind of pushed the memory out of my mind. I do know it was by the method of cutting though and I was in 9th grade.  4. Yes, people did find out. A couple of close friends found out a few months after I first started self-harming. They caught a glimpse of my wrist since I was doing it there at the time. I was usually very good at hiding them, but every so often people would (unfortunately) see the scars or whatever. My parents did find out later on though, they were not happy at all!!  5. I would tell them that it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt solve anything and that there are betters, more productive, safer ways to deal with whatever is going on. Also, if you‚Äôre struggling, please talk to someone. You are not a burden and the people who care about you will listen and be there for you! I know that kind of stuff is said a lot but it also happens to be true. It won‚Äôt solve your problems or make you feel better. It just makes you feel shitty and makes you lie to the people you love. It is not worth it and there is always help out there. People will be willing to help you.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2ahp8/)\nWhat made you stop ?  Also,Im proud of you !|First of all, thank you!  I stopped partially because of a promise I made years ago to an old friend. I doubt this person remembers the promise but I wanted to honour it. But mostly because I think I was sick of having to hide the scars and because I also kind of wanted to see how long I could go without hurting myself. I‚Äôm doing well so far hahah!!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2fu7z/)\nI've struggled with it too, haven't done it in a while tho, what happened that made you want to stop?|First of all, I want to say that I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôve ever felt like you‚Äôve had to resort to self-harming. I‚Äôm also so glad you haven‚Äôt done it in a while. You should be proud! :)  As for your question, I‚Äôm not sure. I kind of just stopped one day. That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt have moments where I want to give in and start doing it again though. But I think one of the reasons was because of a promise I had made to a friend years ago. They begged me to stop for so long and even though we‚Äôre not close anymore and haven‚Äôt been for years, I wanted to honour the promise. I had also been trying to stop for a while.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2anac/)\nIf you found out your kid was self harming what would you do?|I would definitely sit them down and talk to them about it, probably relate it back to my own experiences and give them advice. I would not brush it off or make them feel bad about it because that‚Äôs not helpful at all. I‚Äôd want them to know that I‚Äôm here for them, first and foremost. I would explain to them that there are healthier ways to deal with whatever is causing them to want to harm themselves. Then I‚Äôd get them the help they need. Basically I‚Äôd just do whatever I can to help them.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2arf0/)\nWhen you (self harmed, don‚Äôt know if it was wrist-slitting, just cutting in general, blunt, etc.) did you feel really any pain? Also, what was your childhood like (6-16?)|I had a few different methods so it mainly depended which method I used. The cutting didn‚Äôt hurt. It only time I would feel pain is when I would shower and water would hit the cuts, but other than that, I felt nothing. It hurt real bad whenever I burnt myself though. For the most part, I never really felt any pain.  My childhood was good!! The only thing that was missing was my dad not being present for majority of the time I grew up since he was always away for work. But I don‚Äôt get into that. Other than that I had a good childhood and was very privileged. I was an intelligent kid and was super happy and bubbly. I wasn‚Äôt popular, but I did had a lot of friends!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2ejgh/)\nHow do you feel now?|I feel great and I‚Äôm doing a lot better. I‚Äôm really proud I‚Äôve been able to get 2 years without slipping up and going back into my old habits. I still have urges, but for the most part I‚Äôm feeling better.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2fcr5/)\nAre you male or female How old were you when you started Do you think cutting is similar to vomiting in eating disorders|I am female. I was about 13-14 when I first started  self-harming. Can‚Äôt remember the exact age but it was one of those. And I don‚Äôt know? I can‚Äôt really say for sure. But I guess they are similar in the way that they can both be very dangerous and they‚Äôre self-destructive behaviours.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2jyes/)\nGood for you.  How old are you now?  What were people's reactions when they found out?|I will be 23 in a couple of months! :)  The most common reactions were shock, worry and confusion. I understand all of those reactions and they were all valid. Im just lucky no one suddenly dropped me as a friend or said hurtful things lol.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2kmb3/)\nAre there any scars left?|A lot of them are mostly faded by now but there are some still there. But you probably wouldn‚Äôt notice them unless you looked really, really hard and used a magnifying glass though, lol.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/g5awei/ive_been_clean_from_selfharm_for_just_over_2/fo2lgf9/)\n\n---\n[Source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler)"", 'How?!

I know that it is hard for her to deal with me, especially on top of her own issues, so sometimes I don\'t reach out and just do it which always makes her feel worse. I feel like if I tell her I\'m going to make her upset. She always tells me that I shouldn\'t worry about it and that she\'s not sad for herself but just sad for me and what I have to go through.

TIR Kishimoto alludes to self-harm and suicide in this page of Gaara from Vol.15...,,11qg8b7,736,114,https://i.redd.it/2eef7lp5mjna1.jpg,"[""Alludes? Eh, he's literally got his knife to his wrist. That isn't allusion; it's straight up an explicit illustration of a suicide attempt. And I'm not sure how anyone can miss this even while reading it for the first time.\n\nThe only difference between gaara and sasuke is that sasuke doesn't do it directly; he just hurtles himself into life-threatening situations, not caring whether he lives or dies. It's no wonder gaara could relate to him and orochimaru sniffed it (his intense nature to self-harm) out during his encounter with child sasuke at the forest of death; and that's what he capitalized on to lure sasuke in: he'd given up on life completely and didn't care what happened to him as long as itachi paid.

I watch feminist content to digitally self-harm,"I often go to feminist subreddits to purposely seek out disparaging anti incel and anti male content. Usually I go on subs like TwoX or fourthwavewomen and search up ""incels"" or ""lonely men "" and then I spend hours reading about how ""The bar is literally so low for men"" and ""Men are lonely because they're entitled and lazy."" On YouTube I search up ""lonely men"", scroll past all the normal videos and even manosphere ones just to find : ""why I don't care about male loneliness and neither should you"" and I watch it. I'm not an anti-feminist and I know not all feminists hate men, but I can't stop watching ones that do. It's not a degradation kink because I don't enjoy watching the content.

Asking clients to see their self-harm injuries?,"I‚Äôm interested to hear y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts about asking clients to show their self-harm injuries, mainly cuts. I‚Äôve heard from colleagues and read points on both sides of the discussion and know that there isn‚Äôt an easy answer. 

For example, in support of asking clients to show them:

-needing to know how severe the cuts are and if they require medical attention

-checking the location of the cuts in relation to main arteries/veins/other significant areas


And for against asking clients:

-you can get this same information by directly asking the client

-this is a personal thing that the client should feel empowered to do on their own accord

-clients can perceive this to be coming from a place of judgment and shame

I‚Äôm aware that deciding to make or not make this request can depend on the relationship with the client. Someone might feel more comfortable asking this of a client they‚Äôve seen for a while vs a brand new client at intake. It also might depend on the setting you work in. For instance, I work at a university counseling center that‚Äôs housed in the same building as the student health center. If either myself or one of my colleagues has a concern about a client‚Äôs self-harm injuries, it‚Äôll be easy to access medical care. This might not be the case for a private practice or in a community mental health setting. The specific orientation/approach a clinician uses can affect this decision too, I can imagine. 

I tried searching the subreddit to see if this has been asked before but turned up with little (or the reddit app‚Äôs search function is busted). A small group of my colleagues were discussing this today, and there were a mix of opinions. I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing from y‚Äôall!",164y3q5,40,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/164y3q5/asking_clients_to_see_their_selfharm_injuries/,"['As a social worker and (former) self harmer, had a therapist wanted to see my injuries, it would have caused me to harm much deeper or more severely, out of fear of not being taken seriously.

I don‚Äôt make demands. But under certain circumstances, I *might* ask. This is typically more for my younger clients than adults, but I may ask if they would like me to take a look, depending on our history working together, especially if they‚Äôve expressed that the injury is in any way worse than they expected it would be or abnormal. I have experience and training to assess the severity of the injury, and even when all they need is a bandaid, for some of my kiddos that‚Äôs an important opportunity to demonstrate care and concern for their safety. I‚Äôm not a presence who‚Äôs going to scold them or get them in trouble, I‚Äôm not disappointed if they backslide and self harm. I keep an ‚Äúoops‚Äù kit in my office for when my self harm clients slip, since my self-harm kiddos especially have a nasty habit of not cleaning the injury or protecting the wound. Sometimes if they tell me they self harmed all I do is ask if they‚Äôre okay, the usual risk assessment questions, and if they need to use my first aid kit to look after it. Because oftentimes, there‚Äôs no reason for me to take a look, unless they want me to. I never feel compelled to verify the existence of the self-harm, and I trust my kiddos when they tell me it was self harm and not a suicide attempt. There is never any judgment or shaming in these discussions or interactions, and I would never ask to see an injury anywhere that isn‚Äôt easily visible (for injuries in more private or covered areas, we talk about if they need to show a parent sometime once they‚Äôre back home). If anything, in my experience with my particular clients, this has served to significantly diminish any dishonesty or deception around the self harm. Discussions surrounding self harm have ended up being much easier for my clients, and we‚Äôre able to move pretty quickly from them hiding it out of shame, embarrassment, fear, etc., to them being open enough with me about it to tell me if anything happened without my needing to ask, and finally to them being open with me *and* with their caregivers. The result is a safer kid who trusts the adults around them to be focused on support, not anger or judgment. They also don‚Äôt worry about trying to hide the self harm. So if I‚Äôve got a kid who‚Äôs been anxious all day at school trying to make sure her pile of bracelets stayed in place over her cuts, she knows she‚Äôs free and welcome to remove it and be comfortable in session. Or my kid who wears sweatshirts all day and can come to my office and take it off to chill in a tank top without worrying about any negative reaction or me showing some kind of aversion to the injuries.\n\nI have my own history of self injury, and had times in my childhood when I was subjected to body checks against my will.

It was honestly traumatizing, especially as an SA survivor on top of it all. I guess my ultimate point is that you have no idea what kind of feedback your clients have gotten from friends, family, and even professionals regarding their self-harm and asking to see their self-harm could trigger so many emotional responses they may not share with you.

Maybe if you're an MD or nurse?"", 'We all have our various style and approaches and mine differs from the responses you\'ve received so far.  I\'m a psychologist, 34 years in PP and I\'ve accrued quite a bit of experience with self injury.\n\nWhen working with a patient for whom self injury is part of the presentation I conduct my standard mental status exam and suicide risk assessment.  When I learn that the patient has a history self injury I have an additional decision tree and set of questions to explore.  It includes:\n\n\\--Nature of the self injury: what they do, implement used, frequency, mood state they are in when self injuring, objectives.    I\'ve found that people engage in self injury for a number of reasons.  Some people have a problem with dissociation and they self injury to bring themselves back to being more grounded.  With other folks it\'s the reverse: they self injure to produce emotional numbing as a means of coping.   Some folks self injure out of self loathing.  Some do it to concretize and make manifest their inner pain.   Some do it for interpersonal reasons, to show what another person ""did"" to them.   Often anger is part of the equation.   I\'m always interested in the dynamics behind the self injury.\n\n\\--I always ask, when self injuring, how they know to stop.   It is that they\'ve achieved the desired numbing, punished themselves ""enough"", drawn sufficient blood--when is enough enough?   This line of questioning is often helpful.\n\n\\--I always ask about care of the injuries and who knows what they do.\n\n\\--I always want to know age of onset of self injuring, the course and chronicity.   Self injury can be progressive and addictive.  Most folks outgrow it  but some become dependent upon the behavior, presumably due to the endorphine release theory.\n\n\\--I do ask to see signs of injury if they are in a part of the body appropriate to show.   Typically, injuries are on the nondominant forearm.  I want to see the extent of the scarring--it tells a story and sometimes the patient\'s verbal account is not consistent with the story told by visual inspection.   Sometime there are self-deprecatory words carved in the skin, cross-hatching, multiple cuts--people don\'t fully describe what their doing to themselves and I feel it would be an incomplete eval if I didn\'t really appreciate the nature of the self injury.   I don\'t ask to see any other parts of the body other than the arms.  That said, it is diagnostic when folks share that they have, indeed, moved on to other body parts--the upper thighs, stomach area, buttocks--for self injury.  It shows progression and determination to keep the behavior private.   I appreciate the comments here that request for visual inspection is intrusive but I do my best to incorporate this aspect of the assessment into a partnership with the patient and I hope it demonstrates my concern.   If the patient refuses to pull up their sleeve I don\'t press the point but we do discuss it.  It\'s like the person seeking help for alcohol abuse who won\'t share their frequency or amount consumed.  I feel this aspect of the assessment--which is not the central piece--reinforces collaboration between myself and the patient in addressing this quite serious problem for which they are seeking help.  I think the decision whether or not to incorporate this into the care of the patient is the choice of the provider--for me I feel it\'s a demonstration of commitment to helping the patient.\n\nMoving on to treatment, this is a good-prognosis scenario.  Most folks get better.   It\'s not nearly as difficult as eating disorders or substance abuse, at least not in my experience.  I use a relapse prevention, motivational interviewing, supportive, dbt-guided approach and,  unless there are lots of other aspects to the situation or the behavior is really entrenched, it usually remits without much difficulty.', 'I am not comfortable assessing the severity of self harm injuries. That would be outside of my scope of practice.\n\nThat being said I never ask to see due to mine own history and understanding that it puts clients in a position of incredible vulnerability. If I was asked this as a client it would make me incredibly uncomfortable, even when asking to see old scars.', 'Nope. I‚Äôm not a doctor, I just play one on TV (jk)', ""That's a hard no for me. I educate for harm reduction . Obviously discussions options to not..but if they do. . I give some must knows about care."", 'Ooof. Absolutely not!\n\nTo me that would be extremely damaging to rapport*. It is really none of our business what the harm done looks like, and to a degree, where. Yes, there is a fine line between NSSI and intent to commit suicide. But I think many jump to the conclusion that cuts on the arm are immediately indicative of suicidal intent. I do not believe that, per se. Yes, it is a riskier place to be cutting, and could escalate, but unless the client specifically states intent, it‚Äôs just like any other self harm incident. \n\nAsking could also strike fear in a person that they‚Äôd be ‚Äúreported‚Äù and involuntarily held, even if that‚Äôs not a reality. As a teen I remember being very hesitant to discuss any self harm due to such a fear. It‚Äôs also just extremely invasive. I‚Äôd like to think that most therapists wouldn‚Äôt recoil overtly and on purpose but, even a small instance could make a client feel embarassed or judged or worse.\n\nI think the best course of action is to keep it to the very strict, important info: do you need medical attention, are you keeping it clean (how to get supplies if needed), etc. Inquiring about intent and safety planning is extremely important as well but that has nothing to do with physically seeing the cuts themselves. \n\n*I‚Äôve ended therapeutic relationships for similar reasons. It was a DBT group session and I was told I had to cover my scars because it ‚Äúcould be triggering.‚Äù I see that, to a degree, but it just made me feel so invalidated and judged. I actually had finally come to terms with them and wasn‚Äôt hiding them constantly. If I hadn‚Äôt been in a strong space this would have been very detrimental. I ended therapy with them immediately after. I now wish I had said something about why.', 'Having been intensively trained in DBT Id shy away from asking to see cuts. It can be incredibly reinforcing for a therapist, parent, teacher to look for cuts. We would adopt a very matter of fact, withdrawing warmth approach, and questions like what did you use, where, how deep, did it require medical attention and that‚Äôs about it. If we felt like it was deep enough to need stitches we would let the parent know. But generally shy away from asking since it may positively reinforce the behavior.

Also note, have shown various medical professionals over the years so for me, it was no big difference. \n\nI would also like to point out that often, there is value in the therapist seeing because often when clients have been doing it for a while, especially those that require more physical harm, there comes to be a difference in how a client genuinely perceives their injury vs. how a medical professional will perceive it.

My self-harm doesn't feel like self-harm,"This isn't a post about not feeling valid in my sh, to clarify. I just feel like I enjoy hurting myself too much for it to actually act as a harmful on any level that isn't physical. It feels recreational if not a little debilitating at times, but ultimately therapy leaves me feeling worse than cutting does.

A high pain threshold and dissociation episodes are both things that make it seem more for pleasure than pain. Not physical pleasure of course, but the way the cuts look and feels, and the dizzy feeling I get after is something I don't find bitter.

Over 87 percent had at least one psychiatric disorder, mainly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, depression, or autism spectrum disorder. Self-harm was about five times more common in girls than in boys.\n\nThe researchers estimated the risks of self-harm in the same individual while on or off medication by comparing the risk in the last unmedicated month with the twelve months after melatonin treatment was initiated. By doing so, they were able to take into account background factors that may affect associations, such as genetics, sleep disorder severity, or psychiatric disorders.\n\nThe risk of self-harm increased shortly before melatonin was prescribed and decreased by about half in the months following the initiation of treatment.

Daughter's self-harm blades are starting to hurt the other kids.,"CW: self-harm related struggles

&#x200B;

Hi all,

I have a 16yo who has struggled with mental health for about 2 years. She has been in and out of hospitals, different therapists, medications, etc. She has lately said she does not see any issues with what's going on and does not engage with therapy or medication anymore. It's been frustrating and heartbreaking to watch. The not wanting to change thing is becoming a bigger issues as she has decided that not only will she not stop self-harming, but has claimed that she enjoys it and wants to do more. I know she likely doesn't really, and it's a way to cope with her struggles. 

But it's definitely a big problem when she's leaving razors all over the house and our younger kids are running across them. Luckily no one has been seriously hurt, but I know it's only a matter of time. We've tried to remove all blades or anything from the house, but it seems like she keeps bringing in blades from outside the house one way or another. Pencil sharpeners at school, cleaning blades that she tells a friend she needs to borrow. If she doesn't want to stop, I'm struggling to find a way to guarantee the blades won't come into the house. 

Am I going too far in thinking that as long as she doesn't want to address the issue and is unwilling keep from bringing the blades into the house that we need to have her leave to a family member without children or a residential treatment facility? I know it's likely what's not best for her, but I also have the others to consider and my little kids don't deserve to get hurt because their older sister is struggling with her mental health. I'm at a loss here. I feel like I'll be an awful parent either way.

Edit: important context. She just came out of being in a facility for almost a month last Thursday. They did not discharge her because she was better, but because they are not a long term treatment facility. We are on a waiting list for some in state residential, but it might be a few months. And there are some real horror stories out of those and I really worry about her safety. ",17ko7s0,284,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/17ko7s0/daughters_selfharm_blades_are_starting_to_hurt/,"['r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

She has become dangerous for the other kids. Refusing therapy and medication are NOT an option.\n\nI'm so very sorry. This is terrible."", ""My heart goes out to you- this is rough.\n\nI agree with the other poster who mentioned that therapy and medication are not optional in this case.  She has to go to therapy- don't worry about if she's disengaged there.  A decent therapist will know how to deal with that.  Know that in a long term facility, she won't walk out cured, but hopefully she will walk out with some new tools to improve her life.\n\nI self-harmed for years.  You mentioned that she says she enjoys it and wants more, but you don't believe that and think she's just using it to cope.  If I could go back in time and explain one thing to my parents when I went through this, it is that both things are true.  It's a way to cope, but there is this weird sense of relief that comes with it- one that is enjoyable.  This becomes an addiction that leads to more frequent cutting.  Believe her when she tells you she likes it, even if you don't understand it.  She's telling you that an addiction is taking hold.  At some point for me, it wasn't even about coping any more, just the feeling I got from doing it.  I haven't cut in over a decade, but I don't even consider myself a former self-harmer.  Recovery for me is more like an alcoholic.  I still have to deal with those cravings, I just have better ways now.  That's likely the goal for your daughter. \n\nIf you approach the blades from this perspective, you might have more success in protecting your other children.  Tell her that even though you'd like to, you cannot stop her from self harming, but that she cannot put her other family members at risk by leaving sharps around.  Give her a box where all the sharp things will now live.  Sharps go in the box or it they get thrown away.  The box has to be kept up and away from other kids.  Items in the box need to be kept clean- and it's her responsibility to keep them clean.  This approach might feel counterintuitive, but you are actually making self-harm a little less accessible to her by adding in the hurdles of cleaning and keeping things picked up.  \n\nI think if you sent her to a family member you are asking them to take on a really big responsibility.  It would be hard for her, but also the family has to carry the burden if something terrible happens.  I'd try a few other things before I resorted to this."", 'She needs to be admitted to a facility immediately.', ""I know you said she was just discharged, but i would bring her right back to the hospital.\n\nShe is at this point, literally a danger to herself (AND others, even if it's through lack of care rather than aggression or anger or malice).

A lapse in care can mean EVERYTHING to the admitting nurse being able to take your patient in. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this situation and you have my sympathies, but be the adult in the room. You have very good reasons to take away those blades than have nothing to do with your self-harming child. Reinforce how younger siblings copy their older siblings. See if that realization cuts through at all. Good luck!"", 'I struggled self harm from age 9 to 16. I agree with the perspective of the other commenter. Taking away the sharps are not going to stop her from cutting, as you have seen. Access to safe, clean blades, with an appropriate way to dispose of old blades, is the best approach until therapeutic work can be done to help her find alternative ways to cope. \nFor me, I only started to struggle more with suicidal ideation when I stopped cutting. \nChange will come, and you will find a way out of this. One day, you will have the daughter you had before the mental health struggles, but until then, from my POV, harm reduction both for her and for the other kids is the best bet. \n\nOne other thing to mention, social media communities around people who have shared mental health struggles can be deeply harmful and dangerous, so putting safeguards in around these is also important.\nIf you can, getting age appropriate therapy for the other kids would be good to consider, as I know the experience of me being so ill was traumatic for my siblings.\n\nYou are doing a great job in an impossible situation', ""Lots of great advice about seeking help/support for your teen. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, keeping your other kids safe is paramount. I worked with a very lovely family for a year, and they had CPS involved to keep their other kids safe from an older sibling. CPS involvement obviously is not ideal, but it is an option available to you (or to help your daughter understand the gravity of the situation). It's no different from a parent leaving sharps or any dangerous substances out that could harm children. The way you describe the situation here would be a mandatory report to CPS for your other children's sake."", 'I‚Äôm somewhat familiar with a situation like yours.

I used to self harm with dirty old broken beer bottles I found at the park when I couldn‚Äôt get my hands on anything else, because it‚Äôs a compulsion and a fucking hard one to break. When I knew I‚Äôd get in trouble for cut marks and my parents started checking for sharp objects I started ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù burning myself on the iron and the oven. \n\nWhat you *can* do is insist that the safety of other household members is protected. Tell her that she needs to keep any self harm items in a sterile, secure environment a long way from anyone else‚Äôs access.

Would seeing old self-harm scars from years ago turn you away?,"Years ago I made the stupid mistake of cutting my arm. They're easily visible if you look at my arm and it's obvious what kind of scars they are. However, I've healed mentally from back then and I'm not like that anymore. I'm in a better mindset now and I've sworn to never allow myself to do anything like that again.

If you saw my scars, would you be turned away from me?

Should parents supply their kids with self-harm tools?,"I'm talking like clean blades, gauze, bandages, ointment, etc.


On one hand, it seems like they shouldn't because it's promoting them to continue

But on the other, if they're going to inevitably self harm, (because recovering from sh does include relapses) they will need things to take care of themselves. If all they have is a rusty blade, that's not good. If they don't have any dressings, that's not good.

The guidance counselor legally had to call my parents and tell them about it. At first, I tried to deny everything but eventually I realized I really needed help. I started to be honest with my family and friends, most of them were supportive. Then my parents signed me up with a therapist, but that only helped so much. For the most part, I developed my own ways of coping.  This might sound strange, but part of the reason why I stopped is because I read this post online somewhere.

It started when I was about 11/12. The kids at my middle school started to become meaner and started to bully me pretty badly (I think I sticked out to them. All my life I have struggled with my weight and at that age I was fatter than the other girls). I don‚Äôt mean like a couple kids doing this, the entire school bullied me for 2 years everyday, all the way up to the last day of middle school. I got called awful names, boys pretended asking me out was a dare, I got shoved and kicked, mean tweets were posted about me. The whole nine yards. At that age, I had no idea what to do. I started to think very poorly about myself and eventually, it got to the point where I thought I shouldn‚Äôt even be alive. I convinced myself that all this was my fault.  I felt guilty for letting it go that far. I felt guilty for looking the way I did, I thought maybe if I was prettier or skinner or whatever, they would stop. I harmed myself because I just didn‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs hard to explain to someone who never reached that point.

But I can tell you what happened to me.  Basically, I started to feel very low about myself through severe bullying. I developed depression. Depression + self-esteem issues = perfect brewing ground  The emotional state is hard to explain to someone who never self harmed.  The best explanation I have is that it feels like you‚Äôre trapped. Even if you want to stop, you can‚Äôt. You have no other way to cope. You feel like you have no one for support even if you want to recover, because no one will understand it.  My best advice is if the girl in your story has a love interest eventually, don‚Äôt let the girl stop as soon as she meets her partner. Love doesn‚Äôt magically save people from self-harm. Let the character struggle, it‚Äôll be more realistic.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/aqx898/today_i_am_selfharm_free_for_3_years_ama/egjwofb/)\n\n---\n[Source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler)\n"", 'Pineapple on pizza or no?', ""heya! haven't really got anything to ask, just wanted to let you know i'm super proud of you!! hope all is well with you, and great job breaking your habit!"", 'after reading that stuff about bullying, i bet that was terrible to go through...\n\n\nhow did you find out or figure out that self harm would ""help"" with the pain?      -- (did you have friends do it, or see it on tv?)\n\nis it really that addictive?\n\nwas it cutting or something else?', 'You work for Dunder Mifflin and it‚Äôs pretzel day, what toppings do you get?', ""I don't know you but I'm proud of you keep it up :) üëå"", 'Do you have any advice for people that are helping friends with self harm?', 'Wzzw x x wz', 'i can‚Äôt even say how proud i am. as a former self harmer (now almost a year and a half clean) i can attest to how difficult it can be. my personal replacement for it was using a red marker to draw lines on my arm. what was yours (if you had one)? \nstay strong!!', 'What music bands do you like ', 'Hello, I have to say, great work, you should be proud of yourself and you have to know, that your depression and mental issues are not your fault. \n\nYou are inspiration for me! :)', 'How many scars do you have?\n\nDid you wear full black during that period?\n\nWhat do you think of emo and gothics?', 'Congratulations!!!!!

Regarding the posts mentioning self-harm,"Hello,

As you probably noticed, among the posts asking for advice that are posted on the subreddit, there are some that mention self-harm or suicide.

As one of the users rightly noticed, we don't really have a good way to handle them at this time, so I decided to ask the mods of /r/SuicideWatch for advice, as they probably have the most experience with the subject on reddit. So here are my takeaways:

**Automatic replies:**

There is a bot on reddit that detects specific keywords, and replies with links to helplines and resources. We also considered adding something similar to our AutoModerator.

As it turns out ""I'm a bot and this is an automatic reply"" isn't really something that a person looking for support wants to hear - they are looking for support from people, and they already know that helplines exist. While I'm sure the bot was created in good faith, apparently this is likely to cause alienation, which is a criticial risk factor.

So acting on a suggestion from /r/SuicideWatch, we decided to stop the bot from posting on our subreddit.

**How to interact with people who mention self-harm:**

Stoic therapy for non-stoics is something that existed even back in the beginning of the Stoic school. [Chrysippus, one of the most prominent Stoic philosophers, was known to offer assistance to other people](https://modernstoicism.com/two-types-of-stoic-therapy-by-john-sellars/). One of his conclusions was that people who are currently suffering from a passion don't respond well to a discussion about theoretical principles (especially if they follow different philosophies) - they need to be met in a place they are.

A good way to help people is to give them support, show them that they are not alone, and try to meet them where they are. I feel like our community is pretty good at this, and the person from /r/SuicideWatch I talked with also said that Stoics are pretty good at it generally :-)

If anyone wants to learn better tools to support people, **these are some resources from** /r/SuicideWatch that can be helpful:  [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87), [online self-help collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/1c3p3z/helpful_resources_for_those_struggling_with/).

And of course if you notice a post from a person you think is at risk, please report it - while moderators don't have very good tools to help them directly, we can at least try to show these posts to people with more experience.

As long as you involve the Lord with your efforts you are repenting and growing.\n\nAlso, your body is still your temple, you can never go down a path that the Savior can not help you back from. You still have all of your worth and are deserving of love regardless of the scars you may bare. Our Heavenly Parents do not value you any less because of what happened.', 'You can still go to the temple if you have tattoos. I think that‚Äôs all that needs to be said about that', 'I have no opinion on the matter. I just wanted you congratulate you on your 2.5 weeks!', 'If you decide to do it, just go to someone good. I have a couple I would like to look different.', 'Repentance isnt just about fixing mistakes. Repentance is primarily formingba fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. I would say you should use Repentance to help do that and overcome self harm habits. Dont worry too much about it being a sin. Focus on getting healthy and coming closer to God. Thats basically what Repentance is.', ""General counsel is to avoid tattoos, yes. There are times when our specific circumstances are such that general counsel does not apply. The person in the best position to make this determination is you.\n\nI am quite hesitant to call self-harm a sin. It is definitely a _transgression_, as it is not something God wants us to do. But unless you were making a willful decision to do so, that's not a sin, it's just a sign of your personal temporal infirmities."", ""Congrats on your 2.5 weeks! I would not consider self-harm to be something you need to repent or seek forgiveness for. I too struggle with mental health and have used self-harm as a coping mechanism in the past. The atonement isn't just for sins, it's for all forms of pain and suffering. My advice is to focus your spiritual journey on feeling Heavenly Father's love for you. In my darkest times I have literally just prayed to feel loved, and for comfort. My personal favorite scripture is John 15:9 for this reason:\n\nAs the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.\n\nSeems innocuous on the surface, but if you can try to imagine how much Heavenly Father loves the Savior, they both love us JUST AS MUCH.\n\nAs far as the tattoo to cover scars go, I personally think it's a beautiful idea. My particular methods of self harm never left scars, but if they did I would also seriously consider a tattoo. I do have a family member (also an active member of the church) who DID do the tattoo cover up, and it's absolutely beautiful. They picked something very special, sentimental, and meaningful to them, and as far as I know it brings them peace to see that image on their body instead of a journal of pain. \n\nInternet hugs, and know that this stranger is proud of you and your progress. :-)"", 'Sinner?

Not sure tattoos are the answer. Maybe a tattoo artist could advise? Me personally? I don‚Äôt think covering up scars is a good justification for tattoos. Honestly, if you have to justify doing something so permanent, you probably shouldn‚Äôt do it. Just my opinion.', 'I don\'t feel qualified to answer these questions with authority, but I do feel it\'s important to ask yourself *why* you want to cover your scars in the first place. We all have scars, some are just more visible than others. Choosing to cover them may indeed be the best path for your mental health, but perhaps not. It all depends on your journey and the Lord\'s plan for your future.\n\nWhy hide your personal history with self-harm, be it from others or from your own eyes? Are you feeling guilt for harming your body because it\'s risky and unhealthy, or shame because it\'s visible to others? Is it to move forward and put the struggle in your past? Or is it more for aesthetic appeal, to ""delete"" your scars and physically blend in with those who haven\'t endured the same struggle? Is it to shield yourself from intrusive questions or incorrect assumptions? All of the above, more, something else entirely? What do these answers mean for you right now as well as in the future? For others who find themselves with a similar addiction? For those who don\'t understand? \n\nNo matter what, do whatever it takes to help yourself heal. <3 You deserve it.', ""Don't get too pressed about self-harm as a sin. I assume there is a lot of underlying reasons for your self-harm which Lord understands perfectly. You need to repent from harming the temple of the Lord, that is your body, and pray for the guidance and strength from the Holy Ghost. As it is previously mentioned seek a talk with your Bishop. He will guide you spiritually and also would recommend you to a Mental Health professional if possible.   \n\n\nBut my personal opinion, which you should take with a grain of salt, keep the scars. They can be the perfect testimony of faith for you. I know this is a bit awkward way of approach for this type of thing but wouldn't it be awesome to tell someone that you self-harmed yourself for so long but through the power of the Holy Ghost and trust in the Lord you have overcomed these issues? I think I would've even though I can't ever understand you well enough so just consider the things that I said.  \n\n\nI wish you the best in your journey of healing from this!"", 'I would say at this point to wait.

I would second everyone who has recommended working with a therapist and I‚Äôm saying you are not sinning if you get a tattoo.\n\nBut I really wanted to step in an change the narrative a little bit on your body being a temple. I love the temple analogy, but the way we use it is pretty harmful, I think. Let‚Äôs be clear: temples are sacred irrespective of their appearance. They are sacred because they are the house of the Lord. Our bodies are the same. Their status does not hinge on anything you have done to it physically, but entirely on its ability to house the Spirit ‚Äî and of course it‚Äôs ability to house the spirit of a literal child of God. And just like temples give us experiences that help us learn, so do our bodies. Some of those experiences might cause a little wear and tear, but that physical impact will always pale in comparison to the spiritual growth that can happen within.', 'In my inexperienced opinion, your scars will give others ""permission"" and hope to be healed, as they see your healing.', 'Christ kept his scars once resurrected to remind us of his complete atoning suffering on our behalf and his eternal love. Remembering that we‚Äôve suffered in the past but have overcome that suffering is not a bad thing. It could be viewed as a positive reminder of what you‚Äôve overcome. Most people‚Äôs scars are just internal. We all have scars. We are all sinners. My opinion is tattoos are just additional ‚Äúscars‚Äù to try to hide other scars. Not much point. At resurrection, ‚Äúnot a hair of our heads shall be lost‚Äù, our bodies will be made perfect. There‚Äôs no need to fret about past scars. Through Christ you will be healed of all wounds.', 'For one-no, you haven‚Äôt sinned, and getting a tattoo wouldn‚Äôt be a sin, especially for something like this. When you ask if you need to repent, some people are saying you do, and let me clarify: repent means to turn closer to God, be we usually use it to me to ‚Äústop doing a bad thing.‚Äù So:you don‚Äôt need to pray and ask God to forgive you for self-harming.

I think sleeves and larger tattoos are actually really cool and beautiful to be honest with you haha. But I don‚Äôt think any 17 year old really knows what they want. I bet a tattoo you get in your twenties will be better than one you get now. \n\nIs self harm a sin? Yeah I think so. Love thy neighbor as thyself seems to imply God wants us to love ourselves and our bodies. I have sinned in my life too in different ways than you but that‚Äôs why we have the atonement. That‚Äôs why we have repentance. Yes you sinned but you can be made 100% whole again through dedication and mental fortitude and prayer. I sin every single week haha some weeks are better than others but again that‚Äôs what the atonement and sacrament is for. \n\nI don‚Äôt think self harm is a sin that would prevent temple worthiness or worthiness to partake in the sacrament but you might need to ask your bishop about that, that is doctrine according to me type thing.', 'I hope you never underestimate how you should be so very proud of yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nIts been just over a year now since I last self harmed, and I know how hard this journey can be.

I have fought this desire for more than 45 years.\n\nOne way I fight it is by allowing myself an out - that is, if it ever gets too bad, I will do it. I am on meds. In therapy. Etc. I do loads of self care. My therapist says I‚Äôm a survivor. She says 70% of people with my life experience have already offed themselves by my age. \n\nBut condemning someone who is in intractable pain for finally needing release is pretty awful. I understand the pain suicide causes to others. So I am then consigned to a life of screaming hell in order to save others from pain? \n\nMost suicides are impulsive actions.  Keeping a firearm in your home increases the likelihood of suicide in your home by 50%. We should focus on talking those people down - who are having a terrible impulsive moment.\n\nIn the end, if I make a reasoned and thoughtful decision (not impulsive) to end it after consideration of the options, I believe it is ethical.', 'Do what ever you want just don‚Äôt hurt anybody', ""I believe people a right to suicide however speaking from personal experience conquering one's suicidal attitude leads to greater happiness and therefore people should pursue that outcome first.\n\nP.S. if you yourself are struggling with such an issue I implore you to seek out a trusted friend or therapist. Right now, it might seem like there is no light at the end of tunnel but that is only because it is your job to conjure that light."", 'Don\'t view it too narrowly. Self harm usually is not the isolated wish of ""I would like to experience harm"".  If you wish to harm yourself to numb another pain, to ""feel something"", because you feel guilty, disgusting and deserving of pain, if you\'re manipulated into self harming behavior or have a harmful addiction, in all those cases the purely \'inviolable body/own will\' view might be to let you get on with it. \n\nBut if you balance that with reason or compassion, you might find it more helpful to deal with the underlying issues. Someone might want to harm themselves simply because they don\'t know about better alternative courses of action that they could want.\n\nOr they might want to harm themselves now, but regret it tomorrow, and if this is a predictable pattern for them you could argue that future-them has a say in the matter and it\'s not only the opinion of present-them that has value. \n\nI\'d say helping someone to not want that harm is preferable as the more compassionate thing if it is reasonably achievable. But if the ""harm"" is an informed and sober decision, e.g. in case of an incurable illness, one should have the right to choose not to continue their life. I find it hard to argue someone should be forced to be alive if they don\'t want to, if it causes suffering for them (and if it does not seem reasonably achievable that they might soon be in a state where they would be happy to not have taken their own life).', 'It‚Äôs important to cultivate empathy for your own experience and I don‚Äôt think harming one‚Äôs own body demonstrates empathy for the self']"

Self-harm escalating,"I was clean from self harm for about six years.  I had intermittently harmed for about 12 years before that. 

I was diagnosed with bpd about two months ago. Long story short, i was doing really well for those six years but then had a massive life upheaval (my own fault), and then ended up in an emergency room. 

I've noticed my self harm is getting worse. It started as digging nails into my arm, to hitting myself, to using a hammer or other objects to hit myself, to cutting, and the latest is burning myself.

Self-Harm Slang,"To preface this, I am 100% aware that these expressions are very deeply-rooted in the community, not only the section of the community active on this subreddit, but on various other social platforms‚Äîand there is no getting rid of them (and that's not what I'm trying to do.) However, I did recently see a comment that made me think about them a bit, so I'm curious as to what others think.

The terms in question are cat scratches, styros, beans, and others to the effect; essentially 'nicknaming' various layers of the skin that are cut through or cut to. The comment I saw stated that they didn't like them used, because it can feel as though they're somewhat euphemistic in an unfavorable way. I realized that I really did agree with that, once I thought it over. *Everyone knows* that styros aren't that big of a deal (/s), *everyone knows* cat scratches are nothing (/s), and more often than not, people **strive** to reach beans. We can split hairs over feeling ""valid"" based on the depth of self-harm, but a lot of the time, people don't feel ""valid"" if they don't eventually reach ""beans.""

Cutting to one's fat layer is extremely dangerous‚Äîinfections are easier to happen, ideally one should always get medical attention (many people don't, but that's neither here nor there) and yet I do not feel as though the extent of harm and danger is necessarily conveyed when one calls it ""beans."" I may be wrong, this may only be my personal feelings on the matter, but I don't feel that I'm this wrong.

""Styros"" may even be worse; styros are also susceptible to infections, they can take up to a month to heal, and they leave permanent scars. Yet, they're almost like... the ""default""? Like you ought to *at least* reach the styro level if you're gonna be a cutter (/s), or else what are you doing? I mean, r/MadeOfStyrofoam literally exists (no hate to the sub, just pointing out the name.) And it rubs me the wrong way.

And finally, I think ""cat scratches"" is an extremely sinister name. Yes, cuts on this layer (the epidermis) are often not as risky as those comparably deeper, they scar different too, but it's still self-harm. It's still doing the same amount of damage to a person's psyche. It's still addictive. And yet it has the opposite issue of ""beans"", that being the fact that it's *almost* derogatory. Maybe derogatory isn't the right word, but it very much sort of feels belittling‚Äîwe all know that *actual* scratches by a cat aren't that deep (no pun intended), and equating the two (when one is so much worse by the virtue of being self-inflicted) just doesn't feel right.

TW‚Äîpersonal experience below.

I've never myself had issues with feeling ""invalid"" because of the depth of my self-harm, but I most certainly felt as though it was a ""challenge"" at times; not imposed by anybody in particular, mostly just me trying to see how far I could push myself. Like (probably) everybody, I started off with ""cat scratches."" When I found out about ""styros"", I attempted that. Recently I reached ""beans"" after many ""baby beans"" attempts. I hate that I sort of feel (or felt) accomplished that I could ""tick off"" everything off the list. The feeling of accomplishment lasted very shortly though, because I became too busy trying not to bleed everywhere and generally bleed out. The first week of healing was the worst, I kept debating going to the hospital (though I didn't), I could barely walk, it *hurt* at all times, no matter what I did. Of course, I knew I had cut to the fat level, I knew that it was serious stuff even before I did it, but I just feel as though minimizing the severity with this sort of euphemistic language makes one push aside any sort of caution and rational thought. Maybe this would've happened if it weren't for the slang names, who knows, I'm not blaming anybody but myself.

But, as I said, I think the true dangers of these layers are overlooked when they're referred to by these 'nicknames', I feel like it becomes so much easier to say ""I'll cut to beans"" than ""I'll cut to fat"", I think people forget how *deep* and *dangerous* fat is‚Äîas opposed to beans‚Äîand other layers, besides, that i have mentioned.

Right, so this post has gone on long enough‚Äîwhat are your thoughts?

EDIT: user u/Apexyl put it very well, and I wanted to add a part of their comment:

The Gym: Church of Self-Harm,"There‚Äôs a common meme about men who can‚Äôt get girls who turn to the gym as self-therapy. This is an insincere story. 

The underpainting of this scenario claims that gym bros roleplay the hero‚Äôs journey in the gym because they cannot face the hero‚Äôs journey that arises organically in life.

Reasons you self-harm,"I can list a couple reasons why I personally self-harm:
‚Ä¢ I find self-harm physically validating (since my scars ‚Äúprove‚Äù my mental illness & ‚Äúmake me valid‚Äù)
‚Ä¢ Self-harm gives me a sense of control. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm in control of myself & my body 
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm psychologically addicted. I feel like I need to self-harm. Engaging with self-harm gives me some psychological high I haven‚Äôt been able to find elsewhere 
‚Ä¢ Part of my self-harm is compulsive & giving in to my urges feels therapeutic. It feels like it‚Äôs the only thing that can bring my thoughts & emotions to a halt

Anyone self-harmers who experience self-harming without particular trigger?,"I'm clean from self-harming for 1 1/2 months right now, yet there are times when the urge of self-harming came up out of nowhere.. Is it valid that I have the urge of self-harming without any particular trigger?

Edited : Currently, I'm stable now. After processing the feelings of having the urge, the heaviness inside my chest made me crying.  No matter how hard I distract myself, it won't work.. I just have to go along the feelings, but I didn't do the job.

"TW: Depression, Self-harm ","I'm feeling fucking depressed right now. Katatapos lang namin mag away-away ng ate at nanay ko, literal na katatapos lang ng sigawan namen. Gusto kong umalis pero I still have a lots of fur babies na dapat pakainin. Nakasalang yung ulam nila ngayon kaya di ko pa mapakain, gusto kong lumayas. Pero wala akong pera. Wala akong kaibigan kahit isa. Yung boyfriend ko, nasa province nila. Nasa south ako, nasa north naman siya. Naririndi ako rito sa bahay. Gusto kong lumayas. Napapagod na kong magwala. Palagi na lang ganon ang ginagawa ko, magwawala, magse-self harm, minsan laslas, minsan susuntukin ko nang paulit-ulit ulo ko at pagsasa-sampalin ko sarili ko nang malulutong hanggang sa mahilo ako at yung tipong lalagnatin na kasi namamanhid talaga ako pag sobra-sobrang nasasaktan ako. 

Again, wala akong pera. Wala akong kaibigan. Naririndi ako sa paligid ko. Tapos may trabaho pa ko mamayang 10 pm. Graveyard shift. Ngayon pa lang, pagod na pagod na utak ko. Nahihirapan na naman akong mag function. Paulit-ulit na lang nangyayari sa buhay ko. Normal na yung away dito pero nasasaktan pa rin ako. 

Saan ba ako pupunta ngayon? Iiiyak at itutulog ko na lang ba ulit to? Pero wala akong mailuha as of the moment. Namamanhid na naman ako, baka kung saan na naman mauwi to. 

Saan ako pupunta?? Gusto kong gumaan yung loob ko pero hindi ko na talaga alam kung paano. ",1b0c9rr,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b0c9rr/tw_depression_selfharm/,[]

Overeating is self-harm,"Hey guys, hope you all had a great Christmas. I wanted to write here because usually on this season everyone tends to overeat a lot and if you are like me, you can put on weight really fast. I just got on the weight and I put on 8 lbs on 4 days, I feel horrible, I feel heavy, I feel bloated like I want to explode. Yes, the food was amazing. But is there actually a reason to eat two plates of one food when every single things is going to taste the exact same? Maybe we should start putting quality over quantity on our eating habits as well. 

I worked so hard to lose those pounds and now I am here again because of the ""holidays"". This feels so bad I am kind of mad at myself for hurting me like this. I had no reason to do this, no reason. I will not be waiting until Jan 1 to start my journey again, it is not even about losing weight anymore, it is about feeling good about myself physically, emotionally and psychologically. It is about my happiness and I deserve to be happy. We all do. So if you overate this past Christmas, just know I am with you and I believe in ourselvesüíó

Edit: Okay guys, yesterday I ate in my deficit and today morning I am BACK on my regular weight. You were all right.

*Content warning* Epilation and self-harming,"At the beginning, epilation was way to painful.

I do not dare to understand everyone that harms himself. I think epilating can be a way to funnel the urge into a safer practice.

Player wanted to play a self-harm based homebrew class,"A few years ago I was contacted randomly by a player in a DnD server who was trying to get a group together and needed a DM. I agreed and since most of the players weren't experienced I walked them through making characters and classes, and we ended up with a high-elf ranger, a human paladin, a thri-kreen rogue (the player with the most experience wanted to try playing as a monster race), and a changeling bloody-sanity (we'll call him Josh) which he described as being like a sorcerer. Since everyone else was ready to play I didn't get the chance to go through all the abilities with the player but I decided we'd see how it played out.

In summary we started with the characters being kicked out of a city of wood elves, since the lord of the city had been killed and divination magic had been determined that it was an outsider who was responsible. They all camped together on the outside of the city with the other non-wood elf races when the city guard came to arrest everyone. The party decides to run with another human they befriended at the camp and they get tracked down and they start to talk. Up to this point everyone was having a lot of fun except Josh who had set up his character to be the edge lord type except that his character was also bi-polar to excuse his bad decisions. The high elf and the thri-kreen player were trying to negotiate with the guards since they were reluctant to carry out the orders, but Josh was having none of it and starts to aggro the guards and going so far as to strike first against them.

We rolled initiative and people are doing well up until we get to Josh's turn.
""I run up to them and I cut myself.""
Me-""umm, ok, with your sword?"" I tried to laugh it off and so did the other players since we hoped he was joking.
""Yeah, I take 6 damage. Now all the guards who can see me take 6d6 damage and are paralyzed.""
""Umm... is that a spell or?... what saving throw do I make?""
""Its homebrew, but since they all saw me hurt myself, so they should all be stunned and even more hurt than me after watching that.""
""Umm, thats not how it works.""
""OK, fine. Then I'm gonna use a different ability that I have to make cracks in the earth that look like cuts and these hands come out to pull them in.""
""That's not how that works either man... how about you just attack them with your sword?""
""Ughh, fine.""
He does the damage and starts to aggro the guards. The other experienced player helps to chime in also making fun of the guards and we get back to normal-ish. The human that came with them transforms into a were bear that I voiced with a disk jockey voice and the guards start to run away.
We get back to his turn.
""I run up to them and kill myself so they kill themselves out of greif.""
""Dude, thats not how it works. If you did enough damage there'd still be death saving throws and the guards wouldn't be affected really.""
""Well I do it anyway."" And then he leaves the voice chat.

Basically since I hadn't come across that before I basically tried to wrap up the session pretty quickly since the mood was dead and we all said we'd decide later if we wanted to continue the campaign later. I messaged Josh and he basically told me that he didn't want me to worry about it and that he was sorry for ruining the session, but that we should talk about him rolling up a more official character, this time he would play a more normal class.

Over the next week we all agreed to try again and I ended up hopping on a call with Josh.
""Hey, sorry about that man, I've had a hard time lately.""
""No worries, do you have anyone looking out for you? If you're having problems you should probably talk to a therapist.""
""Yeah, I'm talking to one. So anyway what cool races are there?""
We go over a bunch of races for the next 20 minutes until he says ""can I play as a kitsune?""
Me-""what is that?""
And he proceeds to DM me pictures of basically furry kitsune soft core porn.

Thats the moment I left the call and basically messaged him that what he did wasn't cool and that I hoped he could get some help with his mental issues.

I found out later that he kept talking to one of the other players and started DMing, but that he kept trying to talk his players into self-deleting.

Basically told the rest of the party we'd proceed without him and we proceeded to have a great campaign where they traveled to a dwarf city for a drinking festival, got summoned by the king to investigate a band of dwarves that went missing, found the tomb of an ancient Dwarven king and retired rich and happy.

Idk if there's any DMs who have dealt with similar but was definitely unique to me.

Edit 1: I should have reviewed the homebrew more carefully, we had a few minutes to talk before hand where he described the class as using psycic damage and debuff abilities. I was prepared to take it on good faith which was my mistake.

12 yo is self-harming & depressed,"TW: self-harm and suicidal ideation 

My 12 yo is really struggling with her mental health and self-harm. We've been to the ER at a children's hospital, met with a social worker, and came up with a safety plan. I found her a therapist and with the guidance of her pediatrician, we have started her on anti-depressants. I would say that she and I have a pretty good relationship; she comes to me often to talk things out. Her relationship with her dad is not quite as good, but he's actively trying to fix their relationship. He took a lower paying job (with awful insurance) to be able to be home the majority of the time.

I feel like we are doing everything we can, but it's not helping. She only wants to stay in bed and she talks about suicide. Her therapist has told me to be patient (they've only had four sessions). And her pediatrician has told me we're doing everything right, but I don't think it's enough.

I'm thinking that the next step might be inpatient care. We're struggling financially, since my husband changed jobs, and the insurance has a very high deductible. I'm worried about the cost of it, but I'm more worried about my daughter.

It can take a while for the meds to be fully effective, and sometimes the first med is not the right one and it can take time to find the right medication or combination of meds. \n\nWe went through something similar with my child a year and a half ago, before she came out as gay.  Luckily we already had a therapist in place and were able to get her in right away and got her talking about what was going on. But when it is a new therapist, it can also take a while to built up that relationship.', ""So I've been hospitalized a number of times, and hospitals are a short term solution to a long term problem. They aren't meant to cure mental illness, they are meant to stabilize the patient to the point where they are not an \\*active\\* threat to themselves or others. The active part is key. My point is that inpatient should be the next course of action if/when suicidal ideation goes from passive to active. i.e not just thoughts of suicide but gestures that move toward suicide such as making plans, giving things away, etc. Inpatient will also likely only keep your daughter for a week at the very most, so again, it is a very very short term solution. \n\nIn the meantime, if you want to simulate the good parts of an inpatient stay, the best thing you can do is STRUCTURE. When a teen is depressed, parents tend to either go overboard with military-levels of structure; or underboard, where they back off completely. I recommend creating firm but low-energy structure. For example, serve breakfast at the same time every morning and make attendance mandatory. Same with lunch. Have favorite foods to make things more fun. Have as many outings as possible. Play a movie. Anything other than sitting in the room. Anything to get your child out of their mind."", 'Do you know the source of her pain? I was sent to impatient 11+ times as a 13-15 year old.

She met other kids who had similar thoughts, & realized she wasnt alone. she learned coping skills.

Shopping as a form of self-harm,"I have struggled with self-harm for a long time. Often when I dropped one habit I would pick up another. Cutting, disordered eating, drinking. It was only recently that I realized my shopping addiction is just another form of self-harm. Whenever I indulge in self-harm I often go into what almost feels like a trance and that same trance comes when I hop on Amazon and add over $100 worth of random items to my cart. When I checkout it's almost like a rush I feel. Something about adding to the debt that I've already accumulated is just another way to hurt myself and from somewhere I feel as though I deserve it.

Am I about to self-harm or self-care?,"I'm feeling weird and fuzzy tonight and I really want a jolt of feeling to snap me out of it. As I used to be addicted to cutting, I am not surprised it came to mind (I have a new knife as well).

But I don't hate myself, I'm not upset, I don't want to harm, I want to help myself.

So then I remember that some people are into knives and blood in a kinky way, and that's not self-harm. I don't know if they'd call it self-care, but it seems that way to me. So where do we draw the line between cutting as self-harm and cutting as pleasure?

So my question is, if I cut myself tonight, with the intention of producing good feelings and not punishing or hurting myself, would I be self-harming or self-caring?",1av8ja0,12,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/1av8ja0/am_i_about_to_selfharm_or_selfcare/,"['I get like this. Yeah self harm makes you ‚Äúhappy‚Äù, but you feel better because you‚Äôre using it to shut off the pain inside.

Purposely cutting yourself does not fit into that category, as it harms your body, and potentially harms your mental health.

I'm addicted to self-harm,"I knew someone that was addicted to self-harm. he's since stopped, but I attempted suicide once before that and stopped myself. a bit afterwards i was just thinking ""what's the appeal there?"" so i decided to see. it's like seeing what a vape is like. you think ""oh ill try it"" and then you get addicted. it's like getting drunk, it feels good when you do it, and then you wake up in the morning and it just hurts. I've been doing it for about a month now, not anything serious like cutting, but constantly punching myself when i'm bored, using a metal object like the handle of a screwdriver to smack myself, and believe it or not, it feels really fucking good, but i know it's not good.

"NEW RULE: No glorifying, encouraging, or seeking self-harm","Hi, I was the creator of this subreddit nearly 11 years ago. I have been able to participate as an equal user, as the vast majority of users acted in good faith and were mainly just interested in this type of black metal. 

With the general good will of this community, I was able to take a very laid-back approach to moderating. I wish I could continue this approach, but unfortunately, for the past year or so, I have noticed a significant increase in alarming posts and comments. Some negative interactivity may be expected as a community continues to grow, such as spammers and trolls, but extremely negative participators have grown the most markedly. I was aware of the sort of topics I might platform, but what I considered a possible danger has been far exceeded.

Because the very nature of DSBM may attract more vulnerable and depressed individuals, I feel that I need to start moderating posts and comments that could harm people in a difficult place. This includes, but is not limited to: posting images of self-harm, providing instructions of self-harm, asking for methods of self-harm, and threatening self-harm.

These topics were far from the reason I created this subreddit.

This subreddit is primarily about sharing and discussing the musical subgenre DSBM, not depression and suicide themselves. I am not equipped to moderate harmful discussions of mental health. Most conversations regarding mental health, among other tertiary subjects, are still entirely permitted, but any malicious or overtly unhealthy discussion may be removed. Repeat offenders and intentionally provocative commenters may receive temporary or permanent bans at my own discretion.

I am open to opinions and discussion regarding this issue, as well as the state and direction of the entire subreddit. Just reply to this thread and I will get back to you.

I am not a psychologist or therapist, and if you need urgent help, please seek out your local suicide and/or crisis helplines. If DSBM is causing you despair or other mental health complications, please abstain from DSBM. If you don't know how to find help, I would be happy to aid you in finding a resource that can assist you. Either message myself or mods as a whole.

EDIT: I may continue to edit this post, as I expect it will be significant in not getting our subreddit quarantined or banned.",12deb97,297,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dsbm/comments/12deb97/new_rule_no_glorifying_encouraging_or_seeking/,"['Good rule, sub will likely get banned otherwise.', ""good rule, a couple days ago i saw just a straight up pic of someone's self harm on this subreddit with no relation to dsbm and like yeah that's something a lot of dsbm listeners deal with but this is still not the place for that lol"", 'Great change', 'W mod', 'thank gods', '\\>If DSBM is causing you despair or other mental health complications, please abstain from DSBM\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf listening to a specific genre is the ""reason"" you\'re depressed or self harming then the music is 100% not the issue.', 'W mods', 'I agree with that rule', 'Good decision.

Chaturbate suspension because of self-harm talk,"Hello.

My Chaturbate account was recently suspended because of some private conversation I had with a friend in which I talked about my self-harming past. I've been surfing forums ever since and found out I'm not the first and only person being suspended because of this. I've been camming for almost 5 years now so the suspension hit me by surprise considering I tend to be pretty open about my mental health when I talk with people I trust over there. I already contacted support about it and they said it wouldn't be appropriate to lift the suspension this early and that they were allowing me ""time to seek help"". I don't know where in the world it makes sense for them to keep you from making money and call that helping but whatever.

I understand I shouldn't have talked about that at all but, to my defense, I wasn't aware I couldn't do that, plus, it's not like I was threatening to do something crazy on cam, I was just talking while posing and holding my breath to look skinny. I did read the ToS so I knew what the big no-nos were. I read them again and there wasn't really anything related to self-harm or mental health at all unless I read the wrong ToS. Chaturbate has been banning a lot of people lately for many different reasons and while some bans/suspensions are legitimate, I think they're also wrongfully banning a ton more people over misunderstandings like this.

I would like to know if anybody else is dealing or has dealt with this before. The suspension took place in early October, which means it's about two months since then so I was wondering if emailing them again next month would work or how much longer will I have to wait for them to do anything about it. I've already tried other cam sites but it's been horrible. To clarify, my account isn't banned for good which means I can still and will definitely get it back, as support prompted me to get back to them when I felt good enough to rejoin the community (which I already did but it was too soon for them).

If you managed to get your suspension lifted, I would greatly appreciate any suggestion or advice to get mine back on track as soon as possible.

Thank you.",181i7h7,10,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CamGirlProblems/comments/181i7h7/chaturbate_suspension_because_of_selfharm_talk/,"[""Tell support you went to see a Dr and you are on medication for your mental health.

therapy as self-harm,"(content warning: obliquely mentions S attempt)

&#x200B;

People who are finding therapy helpful talk about internalizing their therapist's ""voice"" until they develop their own ability to self-soothe with positive self-talk.

I think I have done the opposite.¬† I think I have internalized the invalidation, the rationalizing, the denial.

I got it from a number of therapists and other professionals, but most often it was an older woman, warm, kind, maternal.¬† They would smile acceptingly at me while gently, reasonably shutting me down.¬† I am a vehicle for her to demonstrate how warm, caring, and patient she is.¬† I know what to do.¬† I erase myself so she can feel confident, patient, and fufilled.

Sometimes I desperately crave that again.  I want to actually go back to them and sit in that awful dark room... you know how even the air feels dangerous somehow.  Charged.  Something is lurking, something really bad, something disgusting.  Instead I go onto subreddits I shouldn't be on, and I find ways to invalidate myself.

I can't figure out what it is I really need.  It's not invalidation; no one needs that.  It's something else.  But I'm too confused to figure it out.  If I had clarity, I wouldn't be in this space.

I can tell you exactly when my brain broke into pieces like this.  It was when I was 20 and that therapist rejected me.  For the longest time I thought I must've been brain damaged in the attempt, but that doesn't make sense; I was already under medical care when I stopped breathing on my own.  Dissociation isn't a thing you develop in adulthood so I don't know what to think.  My brain never felt the same again.  I don't care about her anymore.  But she sure left her mark.

This is an evolving thought process, and I am in a mindset where I change my mind every couple minutes.  Maybe in another hour I'll decide this was all lies.  (What is the evidence for this?  How does it *benefit* me to lie?)",15yejli,34,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapyabuse/comments/15yejli/therapy_as_selfharm/,"['Something very similar has happened to me. After being in therapy for so long I feel like I can‚Äôt do *anything* without hearing a therapist in my head dig into the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind it. For example, I‚Äôve been looking into getting screened for adhd and autism. This is most likely a good thing for me to go, but the therapist in my mind keeps telling me to think about ‚Äúwhy I want this. If I get the diagnosis what unhelpful beliefs will it reaffirm? Will it be yet another thing that reinforces my aversion to taking responsibility‚Äù, these are things I don‚Äôt really believe about myself at all. But I still hear it in my old T‚Äôs voice. Sometimes I seek out things like self help books that I Know will trigger and upset me. I think it‚Äôs because I feel like I am a failure for not succeeding in therapy sometimes, and feel the need to punish myself more.', 'Yeah, I think many of us struggle with this! I internalized many professional\'s voices and unfortunately, it never helped, it just pushed me down. Because it was never anything remotely helpful. Just invalidating, dismissing, hurtful (or of course neutral, which of course didn\'t end up internalized). But I personally don\'t crave anything I got in therapy, let alone the bad stuff. I hope you\'ll figure that one out.\n\nAlso, honestly, after reading the title, I thought it\'s going to be something along the lines of ""people self-harming through going to therapy when therapy worsens their mental state"" and it got me thinking how many people actually do this. Because some time ago I already thought about how people usually imagine that self-harm means something like cutting and burning yourself, but in reality it can be anything that the person knows it\'s harmful to them. I realized how disabled people\'s self harm often goes unnoticed or unrecognized or is even encouraged(!), just because to a non-disabled person, it would be a normal thing (such as trying to work, trying to walk, trying to eat, trying to not use accommodations etc.). So I do wonder if there are people who are self-harming through going to therapy... or more like how many people like that are there lol. Because with how therapy looks nowadays, I wouldn\'t be surprised at all if some people used their bad therapists as a way to self-harm and punish themselves. It\'s a win win for someone wanting to self-harm I guess, because nobody is stopping them, in fact it\'s usually the opposite, people are encouraging them and even applauding them... self-harming in a plain sight.', ""very well put. i have internalized the devaluation and mental restrictions by that therapist too. i even tried to talk about it to other therapists, but they were even more harmful and could never validate me. \n\nmaybe it's something you need and made you go into therapy in the first place that makes you want to go back."", ""I just made a post recently about a really similar experience. It's scary how much it rings a bell. And yeah I had ptsd like symptoms for years after. I was struggling when I went to therapy and her tone of voice, demeanor, and hypocrisy and insecurity became my inner monologue. I was already struggling so it's like she became the predominant negative voice in my head. And it was the same thing with her ceremoniously acting reasonable and kind. I experienced childhood abuse and this and even her home was reminiscent of my toxic family. I don't mean anything physical. I mean the apparent family dynamics. Because she claimed to be up to date on NPD and trauma I thought she was like the mass of therapists out there with their own bad childhoods. Lots of people who educate on those topics disclose their personal struggles. This woman was soulless. She was a narcissist herself and projected it on to me."", ""I think it's bigger than just therapy and has some social engineering going on.  Getting angry about injustices and oppression is much more socially taboo and people have been brainwashed into pushing therapy.

(I kept getting therapists the same age as me, but definite creepy pseudomommies, except they\'re always so calm, while showing warmth, and so reasonable, and warmly, caringly, patiently shutting me down and convincing me there is no alternative but to comply with them, and it\'s not that my feelings aren\'t important, it\'s that the feelings they *know* I\'m having are more important than the feelings I *think* I\'m having and so and so on until I want to tear my own skin off.)\n\nAnd yeah, after I heard ""internalized therapist voice"" described as a desirable outcome of therapy, I started using it as the label for the most insidious and destructive part of my internal monologue.\n\n>I can\'t figure out what it is I really need. It\'s not invalidation; no one needs that. It\'s something else. But I\'m too confused to figure it out. If I had clarity, I wouldn\'t be in this space.\n\nYeah, there are a lot of reasons why people want to throw themselves back into traumatic situations.  Sometimes it\'s the hope that this time it will go differently and you will be in control.  Sometimes it\'s wanting to understand.  Sometimes it\'s self-punishment.  Sometimes, especially when the harm is considered normalized, there\'s the wish that you could just break enough to be remade into what they want.  It\'s complicated and can be really painful and confusing. \n\n>Dissociation isn\'t a thing you develop in adulthood so I don\'t know what to think.\n\nSome kinds of dissociation can develop in adulthood.  Like there are some dissociative conditions that only develop in childhood, but the whole thing is a spectrum.  Feeling like something is wrong with your brain and there\'s a level of disconnect is something that can develop as an adult.', "">I think I have done the opposite.  I think I have internalized the invalidation, the rationalizing, the denial.\n\nQuite true. I also internalized a negative critical voice after the therapy.\n\n>This is an evolving thought process, and I am in a mindset where I change my mind every couple minutes. Maybe in another hour I'll decide this was all lies. (What is the evidence for this?

How to cosplay kangel without my parents knowing it's kangel? ‚ö†Ô∏è(TW: mentioned self-harm and suicide)‚ö†Ô∏è,"Okay so i need advice
I really want to cosplay kangel when I go to cosplay with my friends, but when I cosplay my parents always ask what character I am and/or from. They said once a while ago that if I said or did something suicidal then they would send me to a mental hospital (since i struggle with sh and suicidal thoughts a lot) And if I told them that it was kangel from needy streamer overload and they looked it up, I would HELLA be at the psych ward 100%. PLUS my debit card is on a joint account with my dad so he can see everything I buy so like idk what to do :(",1aiy6xb,163,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeedyStreamerOverload/comments/1aiy6xb/how_to_cosplay_kangel_without_my_parents_knowing/,"[""say it's a character youve created"", 'Say she is from Naruto Shippuden fillers', 'You could buy it second hand and ask the seller to write the product up as something else.\n(For example, tell the buyer you have a shared credit card, and the cosplay is meant to be a surprise for the person you share it with)\nAsk to write it up as a cosplay you already have, and just tell your parents the old one broke.\nSo you rebought it.\n\n\nOr you could ask your friend to buy it and pay them with the credit card later.\nJust tell your parents you owe your friend for an expansive meal or smth.\n\n\n\nEither way, later, you just hide the cosplay in a bag and change into it when out with your friends.', 'buy a gift card and buy the cosplay online then or ask a friend to get it. then you can just say your cosplay is from like some like magical girl show.', ""Make up an anime that doesn't exist, and when they can't find it, say that it must be too new to search for.
