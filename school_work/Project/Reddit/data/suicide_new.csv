How do you thank someone for saving your life?,"I was planning on committing suicide on Feb 6. Very detailed plan and everything ready to go. Long story short, my best friend knew something was wrong, picked me up, and took me to the hospital. 21 days later I‚Äôm starting to feel better, my meds are helping, and I‚Äôm developing a new approach on life. I keep thinking about my friend, and how I likely wouldn‚Äôt be here if it weren‚Äôt for him. It‚Äôs crazy for me to think about.

Suicidal for 8 years. I need help,"disclaimer: I AM NOT PLANNING TO TAKE MY LIFE

I'll be 27 this year. I'm currently packing my apartment to move back in with my parents. This will make my 8th move since COVID. My next job after moving will be somewhere north of #20. I've lost count.

I don't know what to do. As a young adult I've constantly been affirmed of my potential - I'm a decently good-looking, intelligent and amiable guy. Not bragging at all, as I know these are god-given. On the contrary it makes me feel useless for having failed at everything I've tried. Every earnest pursuit at improving myself ends in unmanageable anxiety, then depression, then indifference.

I'm flat broke, $30k in college debt (with no degree) and have no marketable skills. I know my ADHD and lack of a good support system makes most everything harder in my life and I'm at peace with that. I could shoulder that burden if it could get me over this feeling of worthlessness and having to do menial work. The only thing that keeps me alive is the guilt of knowing my death would upset others. I think about dying casually, even when I'm having a really great day. Again, I am NOT going to kill myself. I just want things to let up enough for me to start enjoying life. I want to travel, discover passions, get married and have a family. I want to stop living hand-to-mouth and be someone I can be proud of.

Anyone have anything to offer: books, personal experiences, opportunities that may help? Cannot currently afford medication but will be back on as soon as I can afford it. I'm open to, and crazy enough to try almost anything. Not too keen on going back to therapy, church, or school.

1. Underage girl scam (probably for older students)
2. Overpayment scams or accidental payment scams (not sending it back)
3. Nude pic blackmail (probably one of the most critical can lead to suicide etc)
4. Verify who you are talking to in person on fb, instagram, etc, it might not be your friend, could be cloned / stolen accounts
5. Pin scams (my niece fell for this last week and lost her account to the scammer)
6. Wrong number scams

Affected by family of an alcoholic? ,"Hey everybody! 
So I'm not sure if this is the right place, since I'm not involved with an alcoholic directly myself but feel that I'm being affected via my friend. I feel like I'm going insane since I don't really have a direct history of alcoholism in my family so I'm in way over my head (for context, the friend in question DOES have a family history of alcoholism/is an ACoA and her brother is the alcoholic here). Myself‚Äî I think that I did have alcoholics in my family at some point in my dad's side (from SW China/Myanmar region) but my grandfather curiously took leadership in stopping this in the form of banning physical violence in our family (including corporal punishment by parents) as a result of his Buddhism. This actually took care of the alcoholism automatically ‚Äî none of his kids, nor his siblings kids etc felt the need to turn to alcoholism. It's not to say that I don't have trauma, but physical violence or alcoholism was never really a part of my life growing up so this type of trauma is new territory and I'm trying my best to empathize and communicate with my friend. I'm not sure how to approach it because her mom was a violent disciplinarian, and her dad was an alcoholic at some point and is now on dialysis. Her brother is actively an alcoholic as a result of his traumas (which are numerous and don't feel like getting into it right here).


Anyways, the long and the short of it as that oviously the brother's behavior has been insane but I'm honestly truly confused by my friend and what she seems to allow and how she seems to talk to me as well. Sometimes when talking to her, I feel like I live in a backwards world where ""the squeaky wheel gets the grease"" ie, people who are problematic like her brother are listened to when they're having a meltdown/bender but at the same time, I feel like she's really harsh both on me sometimes and also I've noticed her being harsh towards her brother when he's actually being good. She gets very critical and kind of hostile and short tempered, but she talks really gently to him when he essentially makes a scene after getting drunk. I don't understand because it feels almost like being penalized for having good manners, or that she's only willing to listen if you go off on her. I want her to listen to me about my concerns, as I've tried very gently to talk to her and she instead kind of blamed me instead and of course something really predictable happened (I can describe this in the comments if anyone wants to know). Her brother has recently gone through a divorce while separating from the military, and sometimes it feels like she too blames other people around him for his problems (while also accusing his other sister who is housing him of being an enabler ‚Äî and perhaps she is in the monetary sense but, she was actually much more honest about his behavior.)  From my perspective, it's quite clear to me that he was most certainly at fault for his wife divorcing him and it was most certainly a direct result of his addictive behaviors. You could also say maybe he opened up to me more than her, but also it really doesn't take a lot to put 2 and 2 together about his behavior now and how that might have played out in the past even if he's an unreliable narrator. This is bothering me a lot because her brother more or less harassed me,  and she's at times stuck up for me but then other times it feels like she kind of blames me for his behavior/feels like she's implying I asked for it somehow. Maybe she doesn't know all the details too, but when I tried to go to her with my concern it felt like she was quick to assume things despite the fact that she was MY friend first before I ever talked to him and at this point she's already had to protect me from him when I saw her last. It also felt like she got more quick to blame me the more dysfunctional that he got while I was away (we are most of the time long distance friends). I also noted earlier that she seems to take really uncharitable interpretations on his ex-wife, and she seems to have always blamed his current state/his alcoholism on her or she takes the narrative that she used and discarded him, and that's why he's an alcoholic. This is despite the fact that she knows that he was a pill head before the military and has been dealing with some serious trauma his whole life. 

They also have a family friend (her ex boyfriend) who the brother opened up to and he apparently doles out tough love, and she's been encouraging him to go talk to this family friend so he can get better. However, his issues run deep and in my opinion the family dynamic itself is pretty bad so I don't think that a conversation with an old friend will fix everything like that. 


There also seems to be a cycle in the family where they'll more or less oscillate between (what is in my opinion) abusing him and enabling him. Actually, both at the same time. Like for example the easily preventable situation I referred to earlier...she more or less took action to enable that situation to begin with, and then corrected it with physical violence on him because she was mad. But in my opinion there are so many things that could have been done before needing to physically hurt someone. 


My question is .... Is she genuinely this naive about her brother? Can anyone here offer support or help me understand her behavior? Has anyone here dealt with weird family dynamics of their Q? Enabling sisters who don't think they're enabling? Or long shot, but anyone who dealt with not the alcoholic themselves but enabling siblings as friends (like me)?


I feel really bad for his ex wife honestly. My friend told me that she went to visit him where he was stationed and the original plan was that she'd stay with the ex wife, but she was shutting her out. She also openly talked about her brother acting like a crazy person and just completely breaking down, but her interpretation seems to be it's somehow the ex wife's fault and that she somehow pushed him to that point. It feels like she's implying he wouldn't be a massive drunk were it not for her. She also shows hope that he'll go back to how he was before he was stationed there, as if he wasn't always suicidal and dealing with addictions. Why does she seem to think his ex wife caused him to be the way he is now? The dynamic has repeated with his own mother ffs, as well as the other sisters and even strangers (myself, and his other sister's battle buddy). He's shown that he's perfectly willing to take out his traumas on random people who don't deserve it, and to me it's clear that that's what went sideways with his marriage. He treats everyone like a punching bag. But somehow she does these crazy mental gymnastics to justify his abusive behavior, although I don't think she's realizing she's doing that. He's behaved in blatantly creepy ways and obviously doesn't approve of the behavior but also she seems to use him being drunk as an excuse. However, she does occasionally have moments of clarity where she'll call out his behavior directly and independently of his drunkenness/hold him accountable for abusive behavior, but I feel this is few and far between as well as inversely proportional to his functionality. 





I'm trying to understand the psychology behind the dynamic and trying to figure out how I can communicate my concerns to her, because it's one thing (and not an okay thing IMHO) when it's his ex wife but I feel like she should have at least some responsibility to me as HER friend?  I can see the bias when she doesn't know the ex wife well/only secondhand, but it sucks when she knows the both of us and still seems to kind of take on his narrative even when it's actively not helping him. Moreover, I feel that she is over functioning at the expense of herself and myself for the sake of her brother. But...why? And how can I talk to her about this without her becoming defensive? She's also accused me of being defensive before too which was a double mindfuck. The biggest mindfuck of them all is she seems to be a really stable, level-headed person who makes rational choices and is empathetic. But it's like all her functionality goes straight out the window when her brother or other family is involved (esp her brother). I care about the the friendship and her a lot, but I really wish she wouldn't get so excited about her brother being temporarily sober that she goes ahead and includes him regardless of past history. 


Can someone explain to me what it's like from someone in her position? Even if you've been in that position.

Goodbyes you didn‚Äôt get to say are the hardest. ,"I used to work at a coffee shop and made a lot of ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù with regular customers. I‚Äôd talk to them about their life, weekend, everything. We‚Äôd chat for as long as they‚Äôd stand there. I quit and moved almost a year ago but still regularly talk to my ex coworkers. I found out today one of my regulars killed themself and I‚Äôm genuinely heartbroken. We had nicknames for each other, I‚Äôd go out of my way everytime he came through to go say hi to him. Literally would be elbow deep in dishwater running to the window to tell him hi. They‚Äôd even let me know he was there if I didn‚Äôt have a headset on. He gave me a stuffed animal that I keep on my shelf. He was genuinely one of my favorite people and always the highlight of my day. I‚Äôm honestly so distraught. I know it‚Äôs not my fault, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like if I hadn‚Äôt left maybe I could‚Äôve been there for him. I can‚Äôt imagine what he was going through to feel the need to do what he did. I‚Äôve had suicidal ideations since I was in kindergarten but have always fought through them. I‚Äôve made it a point to always be kind to everyone and listen to them when they‚Äôre down because that‚Äôs what I needed in those times but no one was here for me. Everytime I lose someone like this it feels like a chunk of me goes with them. I‚Äôm so unbelievably heartbroken. I should‚Äôve given him my number. I should‚Äôve reached out. I should‚Äôve stayed. I should‚Äôve done something. I didn‚Äôt even get to say goodbye to him before I quit. I didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye before I moved. I didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye. I didn‚Äôt get to tell him that he made my terrible days so much better. I didn‚Äôt get to tell him that he made my life worth living sometimes. I didn‚Äôt get to tell him how truly amazing and genuine he was. I had moved to another state when I worked here and was the loneliest I have ever been but these customers really made me feel like i wasn‚Äôt. I know it‚Äôs not my fault, and I truly doubt I meant as much to him as he meant to me. But it doesn‚Äôt make it any easier. I‚Äôm so sorry Jimothy. You truly deserved better than that. You were a genuine light and I‚Äôll never forget you. I hope you‚Äôre at peace now.

Is it normal to deal with pervasive suicidal thoughts?,"When life gets really stressful I think about killing myself, and frankly I think about it all the time.

Series of events that led me to trauma,"I \[22M\] experienced events in my life that led me to trauma. I feel like I‚Äôm at rock bottom now. Everything started during the pandemic. I had burnt out in the middle of online classes that were very fast-paced, and I wanted to prove to college my earned titles during SHS and JHS. Had panic attacks because of extended-family drama, the black sheep of the family. I tried to divert my attention by watching anime and learning Japanese because I wanted to be trilingual, and being fluent in the language is my ticket to work in Japan as an IT person after acquiring job experience here in PH. These diversions were doing great for me but still burned me out. My sister almost ended her life multiple times because of work issues. We could only be there for her through video calls because she was working abroad, but thankfully her fianc√© and friends were there with her to help. With her condition, I wanted to give my full attention to her, so I stopped midterm because I couldn‚Äôt take her unalive herself. We gave what we could to help her recover, hence, credit cards were maxed out and money was borrowed. When they got home, we were making ends meet with only 10k of income per month. I was left with two courses during the term, but I decided on my own to stop and let us recover financially. I left with nothing to do, so I decided to get a road bike to keep me busy and as a way to cope. I was doing great in cycling, from Cubao to Tarlac was my longest KM, just like the others, it burned me out.   
¬†  
The year was 2022, post-pandemic. With nothing to do, I decided to work in BPO to gather experience. Something I could put on my resume. I was assigned to a healthcare account based in the US. I wasn‚Äôt nervous because, with my academic achievements, I know what I can put on the table. I was happy I got my first paycheck. CSAT was the main KPI, so I had to embrace the gray for every caller to keep my spot in the account. With that, my TL had seen potential in me, and she could endorse me as a team leader if there were another ramping. I realized that being a CSR could suck the life out of you, and this time I felt numb. I resigned a few days before my regularization. The next year, my family and I were scammed with a total of 250k by someone we knew for a long time. I had my share in that totality, and I couldn‚Äôt believe that we were robbed of our hard-earned money. I just let it go, but I know it hurts because all my money came from my work, which was really exhausting, and all I did was do my best. My best friend from another company said that they have an opening. The account was IT, so I gave it a go because I know it is my field of interest. The account was a lot broader than the previous one, but the callers were manageable. I was happy because it fits me well, but tiring because I was receiving 30 calls more or less per day.   
¬†  
I enrolled in a gym to build muscle because it‚Äôs my childhood dream to be in good shape. I was enjoying being a tech support and hitting the gym. My team leader was impressed because my score was on par with those of the tenured ones, and I was able to see my body progress. After 3 months of work, the same burnout feeling was coming back. I didn‚Äôt want to give up, so I sought professional help. I can‚Äôt afford a psych consultation, so I went to online counseling. I was able to carry on and work it out. I saw my body recomposition from training, newbie gains getting more toned, but it was stressing me, so I stopped because my perfectionist ass wanted my sleep, nutrition, and training to be on point as they are crucial in body-building. Everyone I know sees the change in my body, and some were telling me to go ‚Äúfor hire‚Äù (as a joke), as you could see from alt tweeter. I gave it a tiny consideration because I know a lot of people are into me sexually, to the point that I got harassed multiple times.   
I was starting to lose it at work, and it made me numb again. I was starting to see the world in gray, so I entered the world of ""for hire"" (alter) to see if it would spark my life back. I have many other reasons, one of which is easy money. I was straight in my sexuality, so I had to make an alter ego that could bang anyone. My first same-sex experience went pretty well because he commended me for the deed, but my inner me was crying when I got home. I had no choice but to let it go and be firm with my choices. I was receiving calls in the morning and accepting bookings at night. I‚Äôd say it was exciting because I got to meet different people and be paid. Sariling tamod at pawis ika nga. I was getting attention, received lots of validation from my alter account, and got good feedback from clients, although it didn‚Äôt make any changes in the numb-ass aspect. Still, I resigned from being in tech support because of burnout and toxic management. Before leaving, I made sure I left a good mark on the company.   
¬†  
Out of all the clients that hired me, there‚Äôs this person who was able to manage to check some boxes in my preferences. He gave me motives, he initiated talks (he asked if he had a chance on me, but I said no for some reason), he ghosted me, and came back. I realized there‚Äôs already something off, but I didn‚Äôt mind because my intention was only to befriend him and I wanted to know him more. Talks after talks, we became fwb for free, aside from me, he also meets other people. Our interests were similar, he‚Äôs living my dreams, that‚Äôs why he got me more hooked up, and somehow I was looking him up.  
¬†  
I took another job in a back office account. I tried, but it didn‚Äôt work out because the LOB was shitty and the OT was unpaid. Definitely not worth staying for. I also stopped accepting bookings because it‚Äôd taken a huge toll on my mental health, but my fwb still continues. I can sense that there was already something off. I feel that he is all lies, and I see inconsistencies in his stories. I didn‚Äôt feel at peace after each time we met. Fast forward, he said that he‚Äôs in an open relationship. We stopped meeting for his reason, I don‚Äôt know why, but it was hard for me to move on from him, and I was praying to God to show me the reason and purpose why we met, if he was a lesson to me, because I really wanted to move on, but He did not show me anything.   
¬†  
One day, I had a chance to ask his partner about the open relationship setup anonymously, and lo and behold, he said they‚Äôre not in an open relationship ever. I tried to just let it go, but each day went by, and the weight of knowing about his sexual affairs and his faithful partner got heavier and heavier. He gave me anxiety symptoms and traumatized me because the person I met was manipulative, a pathological liar, and narcissistic. I let him into my personal life. I was genuine. I told him about my life and what I was going through, but that‚Äôs just his way of getting inside my head. I thought he cared, and that was when he made me feel insignificant.   
¬†  
Everything haunts me, even in my dreams. I felt so bad and guilty for his partner that when I see their date pictures in his Instagram stories, I know that he‚Äôs only cheating and using his partner for a long time. I don‚Äôt want to live my life carrying that weight, but I've been stuck in that dilemma. I woke up in the middle of the night, and I saw him online in an app at 4 a.m. Then and there, I finally snapped and had the courage to confess to his partner. He wanted to meet me. I was scared, but we still met in a coffee shop and talked about it. He said that he was asking God that if his partner was doing any kalokohan, He'd make a way for him to let him know. We talked about his other cheating incidents, and he broke up with him that day after we met. I realized that I was the person he was praying for‚Äîsomeone who would tell him about his cheating partner. I see why I couldn‚Äôt move on from that person because I was God‚Äôs instrument for him. I feel all the weights slowly fade away, and I can now move on. In the present, his partner and I have become friends and sometimes hang out. I got another job with a higher role, waited for the next school year to enroll, and got back to the gym.   
¬†  
It was not a happy ending because everything that happened still affects me. I feel like the sky is weighing down on me‚Äîthe pain and the exhaustion. I do feel bad for the cheating boyfriend because it feels like I am the villain in his story. I crushed a 7-year relationship‚Äîtheir investments, hopes, and dreams together. I had a chance to talk to him, and he said he‚Äôs depressed and suicidal. I know it‚Äôs going to happen one way or another, but the fact that it was me makes it feel a lot worse. To my pity, I told him that I‚Äôm friends with his ex to sympathize for what happened, but I twisted the story of how we met to make it look like I wasn‚Äôt the one who told him on (I don‚Äôt want him to know that it was me, although it gave him an idea). But by doing so, all the pain that he caused me came back to me as if he had dropped a huge bomb on me. I thought I forgave him after having no contact with him, or I thought I was in peace with him for having pity on him. I am so stupid for pitying and reconnecting with him that I just give myself breakdowns every day, to the point that I am not able to report to work today.

Right now, I don‚Äôt have enough emotional capacity. Everything feels like a drag. Everything feels too much. I feel like I have experienced the peak of my life and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve been having passive suicidal thoughts since the post-pandemic. I am largely considering seeking professional help, but it‚Äôs really pricey. But sharing this story somehow helps me cope. Your good inputs are all appreciated!

"TOOL and A Perfect Circle frontman Maynard James Keenan, dead at 59 after apparent suicide.",,1b1vxof,0,7,https://i.redd.it/gn4yo8h2x8lc1.jpeg,"['mods ban him for being unfunny and disrespectful', 'Why the fuck would you fucking post this stupid fucking shit, you idiot.', 'L post']"
He was manic when it happened,"
He had an emotional affair with his best friend's girlfriend for about a week before I found out. I had to get hospitalized because I couldn't feel anything but suicidal and homicidal. The first day I was in the hospital, he overdosed on pills trying to kill himself because I ""abandoned him"" and he said that was the worst thing I could do to him. The entire week while I was in the hospital, he gets two piercings, wants to get my name tattooed on his wrist, and says he wants to be in a poly relationship with me and this girl. Then when I got out of the hospital, he said he was just using her and it was going to end in a month because he could never see himself in a relationship with her and that he only wants to be in a relationship with me??? He also said that I was overreacting and that if I never saw the texts then I would've been fine. It's been three weeks since then, and he has come around to be more remorseful and says he didn't mean what he said while I was in the hospital. 

He also got diagnosed with Bipolar, and it is highly possible he was manic when he cheated and while I was in the hospital. I can't forget his words, the text messages between them, how he said he was attracted to her because she was more mature than me, and how he was attracted to her for a whole year and he was very respectful until he cheated and in his own words ""he did his very best to not escalate things"". So I'm left feeling so conflicted about everything, if this was only a Bipolar thing, his true intentions, his own dissatisfaction in the relationship, or what. And how am I supposed to change or work through this? Now I have to be better and cope healthily or else our relationship suffers more ? I'm supposed to forgive him? What if I can't ? I'm just hurting so bad. And he resents me so much but then he switches his moods and says he wants to be with me for the rest of his life and he gives me compliments now but I don't believe them, I can't believe them. 

Today, he listened to music the girl showed him during the week of cheating and he promised me he wouldn't do that but he still did it and when confronted he said ""it's not a big deal it's just music"" and after begging for an apology, he said he was sorry but not remorseful and that he doesn't really feel empathy for anyone. This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me and the fallout is even worse than I was expecting. I am so lost and confused and hope to get some insight into what's going on with him and my inability to cope.

Relasped,"Got stressed out tonight and  cut for the first time in over 5 years. I feel like garbage. The cuts aren't bad, superficial at best, but they bled and that's what I wanted was to see blood.

I cut myself with my cat sitting beside me and my baby daughter in her crib next to me. 

I'm on antidepressants but shit gets me so stressed. I have ignored the urge to harm every single time until tonight.

I'm not okay but I'm okay. I'm not planning on doing anything to myself, I'm not suicidal and I don't fear hurting anyone else. I won't cut again.

But, I feel like garbage. My scars had all faded. Now I have 12 new ones. On my arm. I never used to cut there. I used to do my thighs to hide it. 

I also hit myself a few times about my face. Open-handed slaps and a few whacks with a half-full Dasani bottle. I just wanted to get my feelings out.

Lost my only sibling,"I lost my Brother 6 months ago. He attempted twice before he completed. He did leave us a note. 
My Mother carries so much guilt, but I do not. We had a rocky relationship. He was always so hard on himself and compared the two of us, which wasn't  fair to him.
We were 10 years apart so we grew up pretty much as only children. He lied so much to friends and family and made us believe everything was ok. 
So when it happened, we had not expected it. He lied about having a job and we found out he was behind with all his bills and was getting evicted. 
I had to go through his belongings and found another suicide note from 1998. I will never tell my Mom I found this note. She is a 2 time cancer survivor and almost 80, she's been through enough. 
It's so tough to deal with, but groups like this help so much. I have a great support system and I know there's people out there that have similar situations.

"It's Bad Politics, not Bad Medicine, Keeping Trans Kids from their Healthcare","A study from Finland is being used to justify legislation to keep transgender minors from getting their necessary healthcare. However, that study, like many anti-trans ones, is riddled with medical errors. Erin Reed explains more here: 

[https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/fact-checked-new-problematic-finnish](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/fact-checked-new-problematic-finnish) 

A few examples from the article: 

* The Study Overcontrolled For Suicide In A Fatal Way
* The Paper Still Shows Trans Care Saves Lives
* Several other shortcomings challenge anti-trans interpretations of the study. Although the study discusses adolescents, the median referral age is 19, with more than half of the participants older than this. While 19-year-olds technically fall within the ""adolescent"" category, the discourse around gender-affirming care predominantly centers on individuals under 18 and the importance of early intervention. For the population examined in the study, many of the critical effects of puberty and unaddressed gender dysphoria would have already manifested.
* Lastly and separately from issues with the study itself, a disclosure issue exists with at least one of the study‚Äôs authors. Dr. Riittakerttu Kaltiala is the chief psychiatrist at Finland‚Äôs Tampere University Hospital and has a long history with allegations of misconduct in her hospital‚Äôs gender clinic.",1b1vq0x,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntellectualDarkWeb/comments/1b1vq0x/its_bad_politics_not_bad_medicine_keeping_trans/,"[""Your statistics is terrible if you wrote this article.

You don‚Äôt need hormones, you‚Äôre a boy. That‚Äôs what I think.', 'Other studies have shown that suicidal ideation for those suffering from gender dysphoria is somewhere around 60-70 percent.  Once a person starts gender affirming care, suicidal ideation drops to 10% or lower.']"

"Just realized I maybe am still doing self-harm and I have nobody I can tell/ask, I hate not being allowed to talk about it with people I know and I hate that I‚Äôm not able to show I am unwell and I always look ok even when I want to not hide how I feel","I never did stuff that leaves scars but I used to beat myself up and bite myself when I was way younger to cope with pain. I stopped because things were getting complicated at school and home because of it. It‚Äôs been like 7 years since I stopped I think? But I‚Äôve had this habit for a while of sometimes stopping eating for some days, longest period was 10 days I think? until I don‚Äôt feel pain from hunger anymore and it makes me feel relieved because it means I am still able to make myself die. I don‚Äôt know I must have been too caught up in this but I‚Äôve never seen it as self-harm until tonight I made the connection with some things I felt when I was younger and did the other thing. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm stupid for never realizing this in 8 years or if I‚Äôm wrong now and I‚Äôm not allowed to consider it self-harm since it‚Äôs not violent. I don‚Äôt have actual issues with food or my figure though.
But either way I cannot tell anyone because my mother is suicidal and I already live in fear of her doing it and I don‚Äôt wanna tell her something that would give her pain or guilt and push her to do it. And my father doesn‚Äôt speak to me and my gf told me years ago that she doesn‚Äôt want me to tell her when I wanna off myself or similar things as it makes her uncomfortable. I went to therapy years ago but I cannot anymore for various reasons. I cannot tell my friends either because every time I try talking about it I‚Äôll just lose control of what I do and say and will just autopilot and turn it into something fun and laugh. I cannot express my pain with people I know no matter how hard I try. As soon as I try my body and mind get like possessed by someone else and turn into a funnyguy. I can‚Äôt handle it anymore, it just makes things worse to see myself behave like this when I was just trying to open up and having no control over it and knowing everyone thinks I‚Äôm feeling better than ever. 
I‚Äôm staying alive because I have some responsibilities and I‚Äôm scared my mother would off herself too if I did but idk I have this voice continuously telling me to just stop enduring this and sometimes it‚Äôs so loud and I have nowhere else to say this. I think I can‚Äôt tell anyone because of how much guilt has a grip on me, like guilt from making them uncomfortable and also because bearing this in silence is like absolution for everything bad I‚Äôve done, but guilt is also the only thing that keeps me alive at this point because I don‚Äôt want my mother‚Äôs death being my fault or abandoning my pets if I die.

I‚Äôm just tired ,"I know I‚Äôll be happy again. I know I can laugh and joke and be happy. But it doesn‚Äôt last. 

At the end of the day it‚Äôs the same thing. 

I‚Äôm planning to kill myself within the next couple of months. I‚Äôm going to buy a lethal opiate to overdose with, I‚Äôve done my research and that seems the least painless, quickest and has the least chance of survival. If that doesn‚Äôt work I have other options, but that is my plan. 

Every time I get suicidal I think, if I feel the same way in two weeks then I won‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs been this way if not worse for months. My therapist says it‚Äôs the low of my bipolar disorder and it‚Äôs just like this because of my disorder. That it‚Äôs temporary. I know it‚Äôs temporary. It‚Äôs the fact that it‚Äôll be this way for the rest of my life. 

I always knew I was going to kill myself, I just didn‚Äôt know when. Strangely, I am quite okay with it. I‚Äôm going to try and see what happens over the next couple of months. I‚Äôm going to plan my best friend a wonderful birthday party. I‚Äôm going to go to school and get good grades. I‚Äôm going to go to work.

"Adderall took everything from me, but I don‚Äôt know how else to stay awake","Back in August, I was prescribed Adderall for ADHD. At first, I liked it! I was a bit disappointed as it didn‚Äôt improve my focus at all, but for the first time in over a decade and too many different psychotropics to count, my constant suicidal ideation went away. I was also less irritable than I‚Äôd been in a long time, and as a bonus, my chronic fatigue (which I think might be narcolepsy) was gone. It wasn‚Äôt all good, of course- my appetite was shot, and I all but stopped sleeping. I lost fifteen pounds in a month, and my brain fog made me basically a zombie. Eventually I got my appetite back and fixed my sleep schedule- I even gained all the weight back. The brain fog turned into several internal monologues that just wouldn‚Äôt cease. In school, I was doing worse than ever-instead of focusing on whole assignments, I would get tunnel vision and spend hours writing a single paragraph. And just ust like that, the suicidal thoughts and irritability were back with a vengeance.

On the outside, I became a completely different person. It was like I regressed to my childhood self- I delivered incessant and often concerning monologues to anyone who would listen (i. e. my friends), my room got so messy that I couldn‚Äôt see the floor, my behavior was unhinged, reckless, and irresponsible. I guess you could call it mania. Then, to make matters worse, the suicidal ideation and fatigue returned and was just as potent as it had been before I started taking Adderall. I think what scares me the most about this experience is how oblivious (or heavily in denial) I was about all this. At this time, I genuinely thought I was in the best mental state of my life. This illusion was shattered, however, as I watched all of my closest friends remove me from their lives. My loved ones were terrified for and of me. I failed my English class, never turning in the final essay, which was a group project. I had just got a job at a Montessori school, which I loved, but I had to quit because I was so dysregulated, plus I was nodding off during naptime. So many people were counting me and I let them all down. I‚Äôm so filled with shame surrounding this era of my life and I don‚Äôt know what to do with it or how to make it go away.

I started seeing a psychiatrist this year (my initial prescription was from my GP) and he was bewildered by the dosage. I was taking 20mg of Adderall IR twice a day. He prescribed me 20mg of Adderall XR in the morning and reduced my prescription of Adderall IR to 5mg in the afternoon. He also informed me that he could not prescribe me any more until I tested negative for THC - I smoked several times a day, twice a day at this point (winning combo, I know). Fortunately, I‚Äôm the sort of person who can quit things cold turkey pretty easily, so that wasn‚Äôt a struggle. For a time, I felt great. I was felt all the benefits from the first time around with less of the drawbacks. Again, I thought I‚Äôd hit the jackpot. I‚Äôm sure you can guess whether or not that was right,

The side effects, though not as severe, were undeniably still there. I‚Äôm only a few pounds heavier than my lowest weight from several months ago. I‚Äôm still stuck in my head, still compulsively talking at people (often being inappropriate (not in a sleazy way, just in a nutty way)), still getting tunnel vision, all that fun stuff. The main difference is I‚Äôm quite self aware, but that almost makes it worse. Ignorance is bliss, after all. What‚Äôs more is the suicidal ideation and fatigue have returned yet again. I‚Äôm not sure why I still take it.

I forgot to take my meds today, and I was astonished by how stable and friendly I was. The anguish is still there, but I was able to keep it from spilling out of me in a way that I don‚Äôt think I ever have been, even before this whole mess started. I made it through my first two classes of the day feeling pretty good! That‚Äôs when I decided I needed to stop taking anything. Unfortunately, I hit a wall after lunch and I couldn‚Äôt keep myself awake during my third class. I kept nodding off, just like I did in high school. It‚Äôs so embarrassing. However, it was nothing compared to the chronic humiliation I feel on Adderall. I stand by my decision that I‚Äôm never taking it again.

I‚Äôm optimistic, but I don‚Äôt know what to do about the sleep thing.

Still gay,"Banned..lol sense of satisfaction..surprising it took so long 

Still gay but bunch of weird/stupid shit stopped. Like a reddit that doesn't know what to do with me...I'm sure we're both passed off and annoyed.

Other have had some great ideas started eating again thought of art again 

I know I'm not supposed to show happiness..or joy excitement...lol they tell you think positive...until they see you happy about something and you watch them flip

Questions and independent thought...creativity imagination... thinking at all. Look think do what you're told . 

Attention redirecting...ignore that..look at this

Was told I'm failing my assessment..be put through rehabilitation again...I'm not how what they want me to be...told to be a shitty person like everyone else...they don't like it when you tell the truth..they don't like a lot of things...I wonder if they're still human 

Got some super weird comment...just nonsense weird mash-up of ideas..was like as if a bot tried to come up with an original idea but it's all just a word salad of various conspiracyish topics

None of it is relevant...or resonate...or even interesting. Like a attempt to create manufactured rabbit hole..lol I have my own ideas..but anyways..weird till realize it's as if had been inspired by murder/suicide comment had made ...and it becomes again glaringly obvious who/whatever is behind the weirdness has no idea ...I wonder if A knows ... this might be interesting",1b1vhll,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oforq/comments/1b1vhll/still_gay/,[]

Urgently need advice (TW suicide),"First off, I'm sorry about the very scary title but this is kind of urgent. I feel like if I don't improve my situation soon then I'll just give into the suicidal thoughts. Second, this is gonna be a long and depressing post so please don't feel like you need to read if you don't want that.

Anyway some background on me is I'm 19, 14 months hrt, mostly boymoding still, and I'm taking a break from college after almost killing myself and failing all my classes.  What I need advice on is: how am I supposed to work on myself and my transition while be severely depressed? I barely have the energy to get out of bed each day. I literally had to call my sister and ask her to physically drag me out of bed today.  It's particularly bad since my transition contributes greatly to my depression but I can't progress with my transition without fixing my depression. Not to mention all of my other mental health issues that would take too long to go into that mess with my ability to even function on a daily basis.

I've been severely suicidal lately and I tried to jump off a bridge yesterday but backed down at the last second after a long conversation with my therapist and didn't tell anyone else. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm so lost and in so much pain. Any responses would be very much appreciated and I'm very, very sorry for this upsetting post I just want someone to talk to who will actually understand me. And before anyone asks yes I'm on meds and in therapy.  Thank you for reading and have a nice day :)",1b1vfdd,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1b1vfdd/urgently_need_advice_tw_suicide/,[]
Just want to share,"So I lost my Dad to suicide when I was 18, and I worked really hard to try to not end up in the same situation. In my 20's I had a good life on the surface, worked hard as an elevator technician and made decent money, kept in decent shape and partied with friends. I struggled to make connections with people though. Anyone I worked with didn't seem to like working with me, and I put up with some pretty toxic people in my job.

When I was 28, about 7 years into my job, I had a bit of a mental break. I was struggling with depression and just got tired of being treated like shit. I took some time away from work, and seeked treatment for depression, as it was something I had struggled with since losing my Dad. I came back to work about 6 months later, and was back at it about two weeks before I really broke down. I was trying really hard to make things work with the mechanic I was working with, and making sure to be always ""in the zone"" at work. It was clear the guy didn't like working with me though, and he came downstairs while we were changing ropes on an elevator and started losing it on me over something pretty trivial. Basically I didn't take an extra half step to loosely put the ropes through the shackle, I was always taught to keep the ropes laid out straight until we were ready to tension them l to avoid accidentally kinking them. It would have taken maybe 3 minutes to correct the situation, and it wasn't even lunch and we were about 2/3rds done the job. I ended up losing it on the guy, said some things along the lines of ""I've been thinking about killing myself the last 6 months and it's because I have to put up with this kinda shit. You talk to me like I'm a fucking dog, fuck you."" I could tell he was shook by the things I was saying, and I walked off the job site. Needless to say, I lost my position at that company.

At this point in my life, I had maybe one serious relationship that ended about a year prior to these events, I had a condo I'm still living in that I had purchased, and I had completed the apprenticeship for the elevator trade. I decided it was time to get away from the construction lifestyle and persue some other career opportunities. Unfortunately, this all happened right before COVID hit, and while I had a decent amount of savings and was able to collect EI for the year, I was never able to find a job that wasn't in the labor field. I did a few different things, and I ended up quiet quitting them all because I knew it was all gonna lead me to the same place.

I'm about to turn 34 in April, it's been about 5 years now since I left the elevator trade. I have $50 in my bank account, no job, no relationships, no friends anymore, I barely speak to anyone in my family, barely leave my condo, I've put on about 75lbs. I'm going to lose my condo to foreclosure in about 3 weeks. I'm going to die in this condo, because I have no where I can go after. The only reason I haven't taken my life yet is because I do love my cat, and I want to spend as much time with him as I can before I inevitably do this. 

I just kinda wanted to share, because I'm alone. I will be when I die, and I'm okay with that.",1b1veg8,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1b1veg8/just_want_to_share/,[]

"How do I let go of the rage, regret, and desire for revenge? ","I had a friend/lover who I knew was toxic from the start. I called him out on his behaviour early on and he apologized and his behaviour improved. But after knowing him for almost two years, I was about to move to another country for work again and we went shopping and had dinner the night before my flight. His sense of humour is cheeky and playful and he loves throwing shade. But the last few times I was with him I left our encounters feeling off. He would poke fun or put me down relentlessly and then defend it as a joke and if then would say ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it then you‚Äôd tell me‚Äù but then would follow that with ‚ÄúYou know me‚Ä¶‚Äù which is so manipulative and disorienting and gaslighting. 

So during this time shopping and having dinner, he tore everything apart from the clothes I was buying to my gender expression to my appearance to my weight. But then he really went too far. For context, I lost my father to suicide less than a year before. And I was telling my former friend/lover that he was in fact invited to my dad‚Äôs funeral and then he said to me during dinner, ‚ÄúYour father‚Äôs funeral was in the middle of the day, who even has time for that?‚Äù I think instead of reacting with violence, I just fawned because this was someone that I loved and cared for. He also said, ‚ÄúYour father died and all of a sudden you discovered your heritage.‚Äù (He was Lebanese and I just posted things about our family history on instagram.) i then posted a picture of me kissing him on the cheek to my stories and he had the craziest reaction and told me to take it down because he doesn‚Äôt even let his lovers do that. A kiss on the CHEEK. I got this message while on the way to the airport and I had panic attacks for days. I blocked him because I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to confront him. And when I unblocked him 60 days later to see what he had to say, he showed even more contempt instead of apologizing. I feel complete rage and regret for not confronting him in person as it happened. Please be kind and empathetic. How do I let go of the rage, regret, and desire for revenge? 

P.S. He is a forensic pathologist which baffles me even more that he has no respect for the dead or the living.

Having a learning disability and being autistic is the saddest thing ever.,"Here‚Äôs why I believe I was given terrible genetic luck.

-My social skills are terrible meaning I cannot have friends because I cannot hold conversations

-My learning disability, (Dyspraxia), makes people assume I‚Äôm of low intelligence because I can‚Äôt do basic life activities independently and efficiently. 

-My autism also came with anxiety and depression so I lack both motivation and confidence thereby dooming me to fail in school, in the workplace, etc.

-Everyone around me seems to have something impressive to tell about when I‚Äôve got nothing to bring to the table. My dyspraxia has stunted all possible skill building or talent.

-Due to my dyspraxia, I will likely never be seen as an adult by anyone because of my inability to perform basic life tasks. I‚Äôll forever be seen as the ‚Äúinnocent guy‚Äù or the ‚ÄúPure Angel‚Äù.

-The depression has made enjoying life impossible for me and I‚Äôve had it all my life. Ever since I started school I was always treated differently. The depression comes from the fact that I‚Äôm mentally and existentially alone in this universe with no one to connect with.

In conclusion,I cannot be happy, make friends, live independently, grow any skill set, be taken seriously, or achieve anything. By saying this I am not suicidal, but what have I to live for with the circumstance of my terrible genetic makeup?

mom found out... oops,"so, long story short for some months i haven't been in the best place because of various factors but lately mostly because of anxiety (i've been on medication for this one) so i've resorted to SH. I'm not fond of this way of coping and i avoid it at all costs but sometimes it's just too much and it happens. so, today my mom wanted to see my watch and grabbed my wrist to see it but i just hid it and she kept insisting so i just didn't do anything and left, but later that same day she started pressing on me showing her my wrists and 
so i just kept saying no and tried walking away but she just kept screaming my name.

After that we took a class together ate together and we were cool until her boyfriend left and she confronted me on why i was doing it; i tried explaining that it wasn't any kind of suicide attempt and i don't condone it but i haven't been feeling well and having to depend on some medicine just doesn't feel good and it's just a burden to feel like this so it was my way to get something out. But then she told me that i was too old to be doing such immature stuff, that i'm stupid and i just create problems for myself probably because i saw something online and thought i just wanted to make bigger problems for myself and others. Some more stuff but irrelevant.

We interacted normally for some time after that, until i just told her to not tell my dad. (hes very strict and aggressive when talking, doesnt help anxiety case) But she just told me she already did and that theyre both gonna have a serious talk with me.

Im honestly pretty sad and scared because im not sure how to confront this. Im scared since they never understand when i open up to them (they just get mad) and considering i just got out of an insanely depressive state doesnt help my case.

What to do now?,"I'm in a state of being where I feel as if I'm not really here but I'm still here. I feel like I'm on auto pilot just floating daily through life like my body moves but my mind hasn't even been in business for weeks.
  It started when I fucked up my relationship and just now have I realized it's all my fault like 100% all me my self destructive personality that loves these repeated scarring of bad emotions and mental trauma. My biggest fear is being alone, that's all I am now. My partner loved me and I was hollow but now that I have the spark of light in my body they are the reflection of what I was to them and that hurts. That not only hurts me but I finally understand the hurt that they were feeling when the roles were reversed. 
 I'm not mad at her for leaving anymore, I'm not trying to get her back. I know why she left. But more than that my friends aren't here, they say reach out I do and nothing comes in return. These drugs don't help, I wanna feel nothing they are temporary in defeating my demons. 
 I guess I should try a different route I've been to rehab but I was never as ready as I am now to change myself before my gamble with life is not so lucky and I end up counting worms. I'm alone always and forever. Suicidal, depressed, scared, and just lost. Rock bottom wouldn't be so bad if I had someone there with me. I'm grateful that no one is here with me. But just the thought of a companion in the worst state of mind you could be in is better than isolating yourself from the world and slowly dying out from lack of social experiences and constant use of drugs to soothe these negative emotions.

The Hell(divers 2) was this guys problem?,"The fuck was this guys problem?

For context I joined like halfway through a difficulty 5 mission( bots ofc) and there all that was left was to deliver the ssd to the northwest side of the map, with 4~ish outposts in the same area, with a couple outpost and side objectives in the east.

So tell them (host and 1 other) I‚Äôll  take the ssd and complete main objective and clear all the outposts near there. While they clear the eastern side. 

The whole time he‚Äôs typing in chat shit like go play solo, please leave. Shit like that( which I thought at first when he said go play solo was an approval to split up so I can clear other side of map). 

When I realize he had a problem with me splitting up I ask him what his problem is and I just get more of the same stuff from him. 

And he kicks me right before a clear the last outpost, when all mission objectives and shit was done like wtf, 

I do this all the time, I just hit lvl 20 and even on higher difficulties (mostly play impossible-suicide) and no one gives me shit for it,. 

Like how am I ruining the game experience by helping do the mission faster, besides it‚Äôs not like he was talking in chat or trying to be friendly at all until I offended  him.

Ok edited any advice appreciate,"How do you know if you have pmdd

Hey everyone I‚Äôm new here. I‚Äôve suffered my whole life with things I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was but before I go into ‚Äúmy story‚Äù I have one basic question how did you know you had pmdd? And did anything help it? 
My primary suggested I may but no real way to know for sure? Thanks. 

Edit: here is my story for as long as I can remember, I have been extremely up-and-down with my moods. I thought it was just normal or in my genes haha. My periods were always pretty irregular. up until I had bariatric surgery in 2020 that my periods became more regular but not always sometimes it be over a month and still not there but most times it‚Äôs 3 to 3 1/2 weeks on the dot. I got the more ‚Äú crazy‚Äù feeling before my period. I‚Äôm talking extreme, highs and extreme lows. so I just kind of went with it because I thought that‚Äôs who I was but then I started having physical symptoms such as lightheaded and dizziness, shaking, tingling, panic attacks, etc etc , and I‚Äôve suffered with depression and anxiety, my whole life so like I said, I didn‚Äôt really realize it was getting worse until it was really bad.. and I snapped. Before I snapped, I started and had been tracking my cycle because we have been trying to have a baby since we got married in 2012. I haven‚Äôt been on birth control since my early 20s and honestly I felt like that made me more crazy but maybe not maybe it was just me . I am now 37 years old now.
So trying to make a long story short here,  when I lost my stepdad unexpectedly and then my dog not even a month later unexpectedly everything got way worse and I had loss before so it didn‚Äôt make sense . But nothing like him. I had suicidal thoughts in the past verying, but I knew I was too weak to ever do anything about it and care too much about everybody else, but I always felt like the world would be better off without me and I would just ‚Äúgo crazy‚Äù. But then I‚Äôd be fine and be like hmm ok I‚Äôm good. it was so up-and-down I thought maybe I‚Äôm bipolar. So Therapy and everything they said I have anxiety and depression but no bipolar and when I snapped, they decided I needed medication. Well, anxiety and extreme medication anxiety that was a whole Nother story after trying a few that were awful for me, I finally found something that worked for me. Buspar it took the edge off, but still wasn‚Äôt enough. I did that for about six months and realized I‚Äôm still so hot and cold and I‚Äôm still crying a lot . I couldn‚Äôt be alone. It was so much but trust me it was bad. It was so bad I was begging my husband to admit me to a psychiatric hospital. I was having thoughts nobody should have, and it just wasn‚Äôt me like I said, I thought about not wanting to be in this world in the past but nothing like this. And even when I felt ‚Äúgood‚Äù I still didn‚Äôt have motivation or I‚Äôm always tired. I always have lots headaches and feel dragged down. I feel broken. Of course they started blaming my surgery. Before that they blamed my weight, However, I have felt this way before my surgery so I knew that wasn‚Äôt it. So we decided to try Effexor for it and my headaches. And hydroxyzine  as needed to get through the slump, and it was a hard slump. But slowly it changed my life. Not completely but enough live. It‚Äôs a Band-Aid not a fix but I definitely was doing better to the point. My husband said he married another woman meaning me. üò≠ at one point I wouldn‚Äôt even want to see anybody and that is not me like if people wanted to visit me always I will let them but even then I wouldn‚Äôt let people come over I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere there was just so much . it‚Äôs been a year and a half and I feel myself back sliding very hot and cold again. Randomly yelling at my husband over stupid things. I don‚Äôt remember if I did that before but I‚Äôm sure I did and that had stopped feeling less motivated anxiety getting worse just all the things but it‚Äôs very up-and-down so when I think it‚Äôs worse and then I feel better. I‚Äôm like OK it‚Äôs all my head I‚Äôm fine. I went to a new primary doctor because we moved in November and she mentioned PMDD and that she prescribes the medication I‚Äôm on for that and that maybe we should raise it. I‚Äôm so torn to raise it or add Buspar what I am on now to see if it‚Äôs the perfect combination I‚Äôm on a very low-dose because of bariatric surgery but I did raise it last year around this time for 10 weeks and I thought it was making me feel worse but now I feel that way I did then and I‚Äôm thinking maybe it was seasonal. Of course sometimes I blame the medicine and think maybe that‚Äôs causing the issues but I know better.
I told you this was long-winded, so I apologize. However, as far as the period goes, I have always felt worse around my period but mostly the week before with tracking I realize it‚Äôs like 10 days.  with my cycles being so short, I feel like I get a week if that a feeling ‚Äúgood‚Äù it‚Äôs not great but it‚Äôs better. For example, a few days ago I was in ovulation. I felt great I was singing and all , making more plans  and I thought oh my gosh maybe I don‚Äôt need up my medicine. And the last two days awful I have that burning panic sensation in my chest. My anxiety is awful. I feel grumpy. I feel sad and I feel like it‚Äôs slowly getting worse every time. The plans I made coming forward I‚Äôm starting to dread. Which I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll bounce back, but it‚Äôs just exhausting.
I‚Äôm 37 years old and they thought maybe I was pre-menopause but nothing points to that yet either. 
So I started researching PMDD and I found an article that is exactly me but unfortunately with everything I feel it could be many different things so it‚Äôs hard to diagnose . changing eating habits and exercising I know, but what what else do you do to help this ? Does medication really the fix? Well Band-Aid not a fix , but you get the point makes life livable. It‚Äôs very hard for me to work out because when I do, my vertigo gets extremely worse and I feel like I‚Äôm going to faint even more. I‚Äôm working with doctors on part of it because who knows what that is. 
The best way I can explain it I just feel very hot and cold again like one minute I feel like I could murder my husband in the next minute. Angry , sad or happy never know what your gonna get but last few days just so angry and down. I just want to love on him and if he doesn‚Äôt give me that love back, I cry.  Mind you, on this medication I stopped crying as much because I‚Äôm a crier and cry about everything. Commercials, angry cry, sad cry, always crying so the medication gave me a break from crying to the point where sometimes I felt like I wanted to cry and couldn‚Äôt but then finally, I always would but it wasn‚Äôt as extreme as before, and it still isn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm just afraid to go back there.
I know this is long-winded, but I‚Äôm just not sure if this is what I have or if they‚Äôre just telling me it‚Äôs what I have to get me to shut up because of all my issues if that makes sense . But like I said I‚Äôve always felt like it‚Äôs hormonal and it‚Äôs like I get a week of feeling emotionally good if that. and because my cycle is three weeks to 3 1/2 weeks it feels like I‚Äôm always not OK. Or not OK then I am briefly and it‚Äôs exhausting and nobody understands which is why I am posting here.
there‚Äôs a lot I‚Äôm leaving out of this because if I said everything we‚Äôd be here forever but thank you for the advice and for listening and I understand doctors are what I need to talk to over reddit however, experience is important and while I‚Äôm waiting for my appointment I just wanted to see how it was diagnosed and what they do about it 
I spent the majority of my adult life, feeling insane and now I feel like this could‚Äôve been it all along. And boy do I have stories about certain things that I did before medicine before I knew there was a problem I did that was absolutely crazy and I can‚Äôt believe my husband stayed by my side. It got pretty intense, but I just thought it was normal. And I‚Äôve always been really good at putting on a happy face, and then behind closed doors, letting out to my safe place. And he doesn‚Äôt deserve that. He is absolutely amazing. Even though his emotions are not like mine he has done so much for me, and I want to be better for not only myself, but for him. I don‚Äôt even work and feel like such a loser, but with all the physical things I can barely get out of bed most days, so when the mental flares up, it‚Äôs even worse.

Prozac induced psychosis. What was your experience? ,"My sister had a severe depressive state for around 4  months, suicidal, didn‚Äôt leave her bed, didn‚Äôt play with her kids, etc. She started taking Prozac and immediately within a week felt better. She started feeling better and better, until it was too much. She was hearing things, following the commands. She does not sleep. Literally not more that 5 minutes a night and it‚Äôs been 4ish weeks. She took off the other night in a city she does not know and threw away her phone and wallet, before jumping in an Uber. She walked for 18 hours‚Ä¶ 18!!! Cops found her trespassing (probably finding signs). She dug a hole in my backyard and took stuff from my house and burried it, and TONS of other weird behaviors. She‚Äôs been in a psychiatric unit for the last 3 days, refusing to take the meds. She is so damn mad at us for putting her in there, which we honestly didn‚Äôt. Her behaviors did, and us talking about what she did  to her doctor. doctor told us it was prozac induced psychosis.  We are so glad she did get there though, because she would end up hurt or worse.

A bit suicidal,"Hi, I'm a 19F and I'm so fed up with myself. I found out I'm probably a narcissist (undiagnosed but I exhibit a lot of the symptoms) so I'm the problem in all of my relationships. I'm the reason all my relationships fail/are rocky. I really don't want this stupid disorder at all. I'd do anything to give it up, but the jealousy, lack of remorse, selfishness, and entitledness still remain even when I try my best to minimize the symptoms. 

I'm at the point now where I think it'd be best if I gave up. I've just been feeling so numb. Life doesn't feel right knowing there's something wrong with me and the way I am. For the past few months, I've been researching places in my area to end it at. I've found a few places that I think would work, and I'm one more big mistake/disappointment away from doing it lol

I really don't want to make it to 20.

Just left my teen in ER for crisis inpatient placement (again),"Trigger warning Suicide attempts/ideation 

Too much to go into bit suffice it to say many months of abuse/neglect led to PTSD and now conversion disorder. I‚Äôm so so tired. Four Suicide Attempts in two years, many ideations/threats and over 180 days combined inpatient, PHP and IOP levels of care. Now the psychogenic symptoms are so bad that she‚Äôs seizing/losing consciousness. Today after finding out that she wasn‚Äôt admitted to a therapeutic program we were hoping for, she had a breakdown and ultimately said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel safe here, I can‚Äôt keep doing this‚Äù and asked me to take her to ER even though she didn‚Äôt have an active plan or method. I‚Äôve been on 24-hour watch since she was released from a different (eating disorder) treatment center last week. Following that discharge she told me ‚Äúthey are sending me home to die‚Äù. We went for a crisis eval before even coming home and they said that because she wasn‚Äôt actively suicidal with a plan or means, she wasn‚Äôt eligible for anything and that I had to take her home. So we have been at home for the last week with me at her side 95% of each day. When I come back from showering or taking one of the numerous calls I‚Äôm fielding from clinicians and supports, she‚Äôs vacant and dissociated. Without constant interaction or distraction she‚Äôs just ruminating on her anguish. She doesn‚Äôt have any motivation and she‚Äôs vacillating between depression and extreme stress/anxiety about the future. I feel horrible for taking her in but at the same time I cannot continue to be her 24-hour monitor, and case manager and still be her mom and work to keep our health insurance and my pay, etc. I am out of PTO because of the numerous days I‚Äôve taken for her care already. I‚Äôm so worried for our future and I keep feeling like she‚Äôs hit rock bottom and is due a comeback, only for her to experience a new rock bottom the next time. 

I‚Äôm so broken and tired. The only thing that is keeping my spirits up is tonight I will be able to go to sleep without worrying that I‚Äôll find a dead child in my home in the morning, for the first time in a week. So tonight I‚Äôm eating Burger King and smoking a nice big bowl and going to bed early so I can work tomorrow until I get an admissions call ü§ûüèº (And for the record - I do not smoke while she‚Äôs home and I keep it in a literal safe because she‚Äôs abused it before).

am I suicidal,"for context, I am a college student and I believe I am suffering from moderate depression based on my symptoms, which also run very heavily in my family. I am actively seeking to gain a diagnosis right now.

I often think about killing myself, but I never truly consider it. I just think about the circumstances of how people would react to my death. it has been so hard for me to get out of bed in the mornings, that to me, sleeping is like romanticizing with death and I think about what it would be like to sleep and never wake up.

sometimes when I sit on the roof of my apartment complex, I look over the edge and think about what it would be like to jump.

&#x200B;

the thing is, I consider all these scenarios in my head, but I never truly have the intent to do anything so extreme. It's like my mind is subconsciously flirting with the thought of death in a really weird masochistic way, but I never would truly consider it. I think about those around me and love them too much to ever hurt them like that.

should I still seek help and is this a problem worth addressing or are these normal thoughts. thank you.",1b1uovh,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1uovh/am_i_suicidal/,"['What you‚Äôre experiencing is suicidal ideation and it is a symptom of depression.

kind of bad day and bad thoughts,"hi, sorry for the vent but i'm in need of some kind of reassurement
I'm 17 and I just got braces yestarday and they hurt like hell, but that's the least, I feel so extremely ugly I cant do anything without crying and feeling the biggest pain in the chest. 
Besides, I have pretty bad anxiety and OCD so that's the only thing going through my mind, I genualy cant think of anything else and I feel like vomiting all the time, I feel sick with myself and everything surrounding me, I'm scared that they'll make me look uglier because the problem is my bite, not anything visible (so theres no room for improvement). I know its frivoulous and a dumb reason to feel like this but im so so sensitive about my looks its sad. 
The thing that scares me the most tho is that the dentist said she will *probably* take my premoral teeth and I googled about it (dumb again) and it seems like thats gonna ruin my face completaly and flatten it and make me have a recessive jaw and etc. im so concerned i cant stop googling and feeling like shit. 
I genualy am thinking of killing myself and i cant get the thought off, I been having panick attacks about this for the whole day and im ashamed of feeling this way about something so frivoulous.
I cant talk about this with anyone, my mom is sick at me from annoying her with my concerns (she for real is really mad and wont listen to anything) and the dentist brushed all my questions off (which is fair since i have a lot, but im so anxious i would rather die). 
I cant stop feeling like shit and being so scared and having no one to talk about this makes me feel even more ugly and scared, its like all this fear is eating me alive, and I cant wait a few months to know if shes taking them off or not, because knowing myself i will think about this non stop until theres a clear confirmation they're not going anywhere. 
To make it worst, I had stopped doing some ocd rituals i used to do, and i sort of feel this is because of that, and now im doing them all over again and my mind wont quiet down. 
Again I know is a dumb reason to be thinking of suicide but I swear even the smallest things make me feel like this, im the sensitive type(?
Sorry for all of this rant but I really need someone to reassure me with facts or something idk im really lost and foggy, thanks for taking the time and sorry for any misspells, english isnt my first language

I was really happy about that until tonight as I walked home.


The person I'm seeing wasn't answering their messages.

From then on my mind went into very bad places until I got home, and slowed down a bit, but I still think that if everything were to go wrong, I could stop caring about living or not.

Why is there a misconception that people who are suicidal are inherently mentally ill?,"""Nearly one in five people who attempt suicide either have no history of prior mental illness or do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of mental illness at the time of the attempt, a study in JAMA Psychiatry suggests.""

I saw this today, which reminded me of some recent discourse I've heard. Many people have been saying things like ""Taking your own life is mental illness. No mentally healthy person would attempt to do so"", and I thought this was strange because being mentally unhealthy does not automatically mean you have a mental illness. So why do so many people have this misconception?",1b1uiu9,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askatherapist/comments/1b1uiu9/why_is_there_a_misconception_that_people_who_are/,"[""I've got some thoughts on the study: excluding people under the age of 20 & over 65, and excluding institutionalized people is going to skew the data. For instance: suicide rate in men is highest for ages 75+.  Also, not everybody gets a diagnosis or seeks treatment. You can be mentally ill without having it on your medical record or having any idea how severely unwell you are. Also it's possible to be mentally ill without even having a diagnosable DSM disorder. It's a faulty document that fails to fully capture the complexity of our mind's health.""]"
Favorite TLOU2 Plot Holes and Character Inconsistencies,"I just finished replaying TLOU2 after getting the upgrade for factions. Here‚Äôs what I noticed on the last play through. If you want to add to this list or correct any, feel free!  


1. After Abby finds Mel and Owen dead, she has no way to tell who did it. Seeing polaroids of her friends or randomly finding a map on the ground does not mean it is Ellie. Abby has no reason to believe Ellie is even still alive or anywhere near Seattle. However, Abby somehow knows that Ellie did it.
2. Ellie fundamentally goes from a positive, happy go lucky kid to an asshole to Joel. The Joel who did everything for her. One of the reasons why she is supposedly mad for YEARS is because she wanted to commit suicide so that the rest of the world might have a shot at a cure. She‚Äôs saying her ‚Äúlife doesn‚Äôt have meaning‚Äù without killing herself. So basically her importance to Joel doesn‚Äôt matter. Dina doesn‚Äôt matter. Nobody in Jackson matters to her. She wanted to be a forgotten corpse left dead on the table by an unqualified surgeon pretending he knows how to develop vaccines with no resources. These are the words of a psycho, not the Ellie we know.
3. In the final fight with Abby, she has every weapon at her disposal yet sets it all aside WILLINGLY to use a switchblade. Keep in mind this fight is 2 vs 1 if Lev is able to muster the energy to blindside her. Abby is also much larger physically. This is after they have both slaughtered hundreds brutally without a second thought. Then, after Ellie gets her FINGER BITTEN CLEAN OFF, she decides: hey, I‚Äôm going to let her go. Absolutely not. The real Ellie would understand that if she lets Abby out of the water, she‚Äôs DEAD. Abby will kill her to save herself. This is past the point of walking away. Also, the first thing Abby would have done in this melee fight is to have gone for Ellie‚Äôs weapons sitting a dozen feet away. This just reeks of bullshit.",1b1ue7m,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastOfUs2/comments/1b1ue7m/favorite_tlou2_plot_holes_and_character/,"['To add on to the inconsistencies Joel only died ONCE in this game.

She didn\'t say anything like, ""Holy shit, this is that girl from when I killed Joel coming back"" or anything. She just figured she should get revenge when she found out the spot.', ""To add to the second point, Part 2 Ellie didn‚Äôt care that Joel would be left alone to grieve a child again. In the first game she knew he was scared of getting close because he might lose her. Part 2 would have us believe that Ellie didn‚Äôt care about leaving Joel alone. \n\nEllie: Stop with the bullshit.

It\'s all non commitment to danger, showing characters in danger but convenience happens at the last second to undo everything. The characters almost never solve their own situation naturally, the writer\'s hand does it every time. Characters running in from off screen to bail out a scene, serious injuries in cutscenes that are given no further treatment, and don\'t matter or prevent you from traveling 1000 miles through the zombie apocalypse with another magic cut to black, using pieces of wood instead of their 9 guns as the writers turned off their brains because the characters would\'ve done something differently if they acted naturally.\n\nTommy\'s whole section of sniping at you as Abby he immediately kills you if you step out of cover for the whole segment, so he clearly intends to kill her, then in the cutscene he waits for Abby to come through a door and rushes at her to shove her with the gun .... when he\'d been trying to shoot her the whole time and now has the easiest shot in the world. Then Yara teleports from off screen to help her. This kind of stuff happens over and over.\n\nAbby leaves the hospital after getting medicine for Yara and Lev is somehow just waiting to tackle her outside of a hidden exit she came out of that is nowhere near where she entered, and Lev would have no idea she would come out there, but just \\*is\\* there for the cutscene. And then Lev says ""shh"" to Abby because there are soldiers patrolling ten feet from them and they need to be quiet, but then they get in a motorboat also 10 feet away and just leave somehow, how could they start a motorboat and leave with soldiers ten feet away ? The game just cuts to black and skips that part specifically and all the sudden they\'re already sailing away because they couldn\'t figure out a way it would make sense lol.\n\nAbby gets tied up and hanged by the Scars and RIGHT when the lady goes to cut Abby open she just stops last second to pay attention to Yara instead of the 2 seconds it would\'ve taken to finish Abby first. The hammer lady turns and starts shooting into the dark blindly in the general direction Lev\'s arrow came from and just happens to stumble right next to where Abby is tied up so that Abby can wrap her legs around Hammer lady\'s head. Hammer Lady tries to shoot Abby but just happens to have no bullets left now and can\'t kill Abby.\n\nAbby\'s friends are shooting at dina by a skylight, but when she falls through the ceiling and lands next to them, instead of shooting her now, they put away their guns and slowly choke her so that Ellie can escape, grab the guys knife which he conveniently leaves right next to her, and kill him.\n\nAbby and friends get run off the road in their truck by scars, and they fully crash the truck into a building (which no one sustains ANY injuries from including those who were sitting in the open truck bed) for some reason the scars decide to just NOT ride up and finish them off. \n\nSame reason why Joel is never allowed to explain the context of what happened with the fireflies, and why Ellie and Abby are never allowed to have a proper exchange either. Because the whole story would be ending or falling apart constantly if the writers weren\'t constantly stepping in and altering world logic and pulling strings to get everything to do what they want whether it\'s contrived or not.']"
I cant take the fact that my father doesn‚Äôt accept my transition.,"
Me (20) and my father (54) live together in an apartment. He does not support my transition and it hurts so much. I‚Äôve been transitioning for around 16 months now and he still refuses to use my chosen name and pronouns. Whenever we try to talk about it and I call him out, even in the slightest it always turns into a toxic shouting and bitching fest. The other day he told me he was praying the trans away at church, without even being prompted.

However, ignoring the transgender stuff my father is very supportive and kind to me. He has been like my best friend for my entire life. Hell, the other day he took me to buffalo wild wings because he saw I was sad. Recently he also took me on a road trip just to hang out, and it went great. Lately I have been going through an awful depression/anxiety/ocd episode. He has been helpful by playing Minecraft with me and watching YouTube videos with me. I feel so entitled and selfish to expect him to support my transgender identity.

I am so hurt because I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation, my father‚Äôs toxicity to my transition is destroying me because I feel so freaking guilty for being trans and taking hormones. At the same time I can‚Äôt really cut him out of my life because he obviously loves me.

Yes, in case any of you are wondering, yes I am feeling suicidal. I don‚Äôt want to tell him though because that seems manipulative and I don‚Äôt want to make him feel bad.

Seth - wtf?,"I have never, in the last decade of indulging in social media see a couple where one of the two is soooo clearly repressed. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs private and keeps her personal life under wraps and just shares specific content - it‚Äôs literally ALL out there - every inch of her poor babies, her ass shots, her camel toes, her nudie showers, her unsolicited opinions, her parents, her fathers illness, her siblings, Seth‚Äôs father‚Äôs suicide (I think that‚Äôs the moment she truly began to disgust me) - and yet, this man is NOTHINGNESS. He has no existence outside her videos, her days, being in service to her. He has no real role as a husband or father. He has no say over what his children wear or do or where they go. He has NO friends - surely if he did they wouldn‚Äôt care about being in a video here or there. He has NO sense or style specific to him - sometimes you‚Äôll see influencers all dolled up and there‚Äôs the husband in bball shorts and a tshirt in the background. When she cooks he has to stand there waiting  for his cameo. I have never ever seen less of an identity associated to someone. It is gut wrenching - he must be depressed out of his mind, I can‚Äôt imagine how his mother must feel. Most of all how evil wretch and vile of a woman must you be to have robbed this man of EVERYTHING - any identity, any personality, any interests. It is fucking abusive and we all see it happening and no one can say anything.

Seth if you‚Äôre reading this - if you‚Äôre allowed to read this - this is NOT  the way a marriage works. The money is NOT worth it. Your children DESERVE BETTER.  She is not this VICTIM she has you believing she is that you has to forever just pray before.

And unfortunately not everyone makes it out. There are times when the last  time a survivor leaves, they end up as a victim. In the long run, given how a neighbor saw him storm off in the middle of the night, I doubt that was a one time occurrence. It will escalate, and eventually he will be forced to face it head on and address his failing marriage.

In a way, they met so young, he never got to develop an identity, and he took on her culture and religion and that is his identity. Also, if he does file for divorce, courts will most likely side with the parent who brings in more of the income and able to provide more resources for the girls, BUT that‚Äôs all contingent on if Nabecky has him on her payroll. \nHe‚Äôs got no skills to survive the real world.

The fact that he and the entire family wear outfits that coordinate with her aesthetics shows that N is the ""leader"" of the family (and Seth), which I\'m sure has to do with her financial means now. She controls him like she does her sister, her parents, and anyone else she can. I see so many husband/wife influencers who work as partners not just one controlling the other, making them wear and act a certain way. Everything he does looks so forced. Usually, if one spouse is the primary influencer you see the husband/wife in the background doing their own thing, wearing whatever they want. Seth, even though he\'s a grown man shows up in coordinated outfits, and only when she needs him to prove that he\'s attracted to her. Another thing that looks forced. It\'s almost like she needs a T-shirt that says ""My husband loves me""\n\nIf anyone is pathetic in this relationship it\'s her.', ""Completely agree with the basketball shorts part and influencer partner. Most influencers do NOT include their partners or if they do, they do not control what they say or wear because part of the charm is that they're so opposite to the influencer.

She has him dolled up in the strangest wardrobes that never even suit his skintone, edits the video SO bright that he is washed out and a ghost, dresses like the ralph lauren boy meme?!

Neon Gravestones,"Neon Gravestones is one of those songs that you can't really rate or criticize because of its serious content. But there are quite a few controversial lyrics in it. One example, ""if I lose to myself, you won't mourn a day and you'll move on to someone else."" I think it's important to mourn people, even celebrities. And of course people close to Tyler would need to grieve. However, it's true that suicide is glorified, though not intentionally. Sadly, I only really got into Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell when I learned. We listen to people more after they die because we empathize with them. But there's also a fascination with death. 

This song was made to be talked about, so I'd like to hear more perspectives. I'm sure people have discussed this many times before, though.

Is my therapist in the wrong or am I? What would you do?,"TW: SA, self harm & suicidal ideation.   
   
   I‚Äôve been seeing my therapist for 2.5 years. She is trauma informed and deals specifically with emotional abuse. Initially I felt like she was very helpful. I knew my relationship wasnt ok when I found her, but I questioned everything and she really helped me get back to reality (I was convinced I was a narcissist and the abusive one, which wasn‚Äôt even close to being true). So again, sessions seemed helpful the first year or so.   
   
   Here are some recent things that concern me, but I don‚Äôt know if this is just what healing is supposed to look like‚Ä¶.   
   
   - Ive noticed that every time I drive to therapy I feel so sick to my stomach and usually cry before I even arrive. It takes everything in my being to walk through that door.   
   - After therapy, I feel so much worse about myself. The only days I self harm are the days I have therapy.   
   - She has told me to stop interrupting her twice. Every time I‚Äôve done this, it‚Äôs when she‚Äôs telling me her perception about something but she has a fact or experience wrong. I interrupt her to correct her so she doesn‚Äôt explain some idea based off incorrect facts. I‚Äôve explained this but shes never really reacted.   
   - I‚Äôve told her SO many times that I have breakdowns where I scream, sob, hit myself in the face, end up self harming. She gave me the usual advice of breathing, going on a walk, taking a bath, drinking tea (lol). One day in session I felt a breakdown coming on. Instead of waiting until I was in my car, I let myself have the breakdown in her office. No one, I mean NO ONE, has ever seen this. It was scary but I thought it could be helpful to have her witness what I go through regularly. She acted completely shocked and terrified by my breakdown. This was really hard to take, as it made me feel like a monster. But what REALLY knocked the wind out of me was when she asked ‚Äúhas that ever happened before?‚Äù. I reminded her that I have talked about these breakdowns consistently and she said she didn‚Äôt think they were actually as bad as I described.   
   - I explained how forcing myself to have sex with my fianc√© is extremely painful and destroying. Ive never ever used these words, because my fianc√© has never been forceful (coercion through silent treatment is it) and although it even feels a bit dramatic to me, I finally stated that ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm having to be raped every week‚Äù. Her only response was ‚Äúthat sounds difficult‚Äù and then a blank stare. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm expecting here, or what a therapist could actually do in this situation? But that response made me feel really alone and really helpless.   
   
   I know therapists are humans and of course I don‚Äôt expect her to be perfect. This is why I‚Äôm struggling; I can‚Äôt discern what‚Äôs acceptable and what‚Äôs not in a therapeutic environment. But above all, I feel I‚Äôve really regressed in the last year and feel so much more hopeless and defeated. I have never been this suicidal in my life, which I have also communicated with her. I‚Äôm really scared.   
   
   Is this all normal? Am I being way too hard on my therapist and it‚Äôs just a hard process overall? Lastly, I have a session with her tomorrow and planning on asking her if she feels I‚Äôve made any progress. Are there any other questions I could ask that might help me dictate if she‚Äôs a good fit or not?

What is a good starting book for starting a ‚Äòmore serious lit/ classics‚Äô university book club?,"
TLDR; Give me recommendations for a good initial book choice for the university book club I am starting. 


I suggested a classics/ more serious literature book club at my university creative writing club. 
This means they all read and write at least SOMEWHAT regularly. 

Received pretty good interest and an offer to help organize from the creative writing club president.
So, I have verified interested with a group of English major/art hoes in starting up a book club with more ‚Äòserious‚Äô books. What book should we begin with?

 3 points of consideration:


1.) Confirmed they were interested in reading things which were explicitly NOT Colleen Hoover or New York Times best selling romance novels. 


2.) Confirmed they were open to reading ‚Äòclassics‚Äô. (Yes I mean this in the modern sense, definitely NOT meaning a restriction to the ancients)  
One girl voiced an interest in Camus, another in Emerson or Thoreau.


3.)These girls are surface level ‚Äònormie tier art hoes.‚Äô They are interested in going deeper into art/literature/philosophy, or at least the idea of it, but don‚Äôt actively pursue the esoteric ‚Äòrs gf‚Äô tier of literature/film/art. We watched Dead Poets Society as a group, and one of the girls paused it to give a trigger warning about the suicide scene. Very much stereotypical liberal TikTok scrollers, but with a little more sensitivity, interest, and exposure to ‚Äòhigher culture.‚Äô 


I have not, but almost all of the group have read My Year of Rest and Relaxation. How should I interpret this information?


Anyway, I‚Äôm afraid going full Houellebecq or Lolita is probably not a good idea. Also pls no Heart of Darkness, don‚Äôt want to get derailed on racism talk.


I‚Äôm actually quite neurotic and have been stuck in existentialist works recently, so I would appreciate normie-friendly books which go beyond AP Lit/AP Lang requirements.


For the first book we read , I thought something short  to help initial turnout like: The Death of Ivan Ilyich, The Metamorphosis(unsure if they would‚Äôve read in HS/ might be too depressing), Hadji Murat, The Fall by Camus,
 the 3 really famous Gogol‚Äôs short stories, maybe Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or pick a few from Dubliners.


 Again I‚Äôm mired in myself so please give better suggestions that are not so potentially depressing for the normie mind.


I thought Notes from Underground would be a really good introductory blackpill, but might be too much so for my audience. I think Crime and Punishment might be too challenging for the first book. Is there another Dostoevsky one which might be more palatable?


Similar, I think Pale Fire or Invitation to a Beheading is too challenging. Are there other Nabakov‚Äôs which might be good? Or would the extreme focus on style even make for good discussion?


Also any suggestions for a book that would be a good choice for Spring Break assigned reading?

Showin some Cadets some REAL Helldivin!,"I reached the rank of Death Captain not too long ago (34) and decided I was gonna have a little bit of fun! Signed myself up for a simple mission, somethin to warm me up and I signed up for a difficulty 3 mission. With that my bai- the mission was set, we went in and I made sure to show them that I was a little incompetent, taking the occasional bullet for these cadets every now and again or getting in the way of one of those berserkers to attract their attention. We finish the mission and this is when I broke the news to these cadets, I informed them that the Creek calls for us and it's about damn time these boys put some hair on their chest!  


So I zip us on over to Suicide Mission difficulty 7, these cadets were levels 6, 6 and 10 respectively. We drop in and I give them words of encouragement, advice. I told'em while I may make it out alive, this would change them, they would be baptized through oil and steel and leave this mission hardened for the future for we would lose the Creek soon. The mission was hectic and fun, the sound the boys made when a hulk dropped on us brought real joy to my heart, they directed me toward every heavily armored unit around so they could taste my railgun! Watchin em run away from the berserkers and slowly learn how to kite, route and destroy. How to break up our path and take aggro from those dumb oil guzzlin bots! Extraction was slow, grueling and painful, all stratagems on cooldown and nothing but the sound of bullets and democracy to keep us goin!   


The look on their faces in the ship as we left one behind for the greater good, saw'em burn in the flames. I could see their changed visages through their helmets, they experienced horror...but we won. They were rewarded handsomely for their efforts (+150% Rewards), got enough liberty bucks for them to buy several upgrades. Bidded the men a good day, thanked them for their service on the creek and told'em this was the last time they'd experience it for a while. To burn this experience into their souls and never forget what the creek took from us. **Spill oil, brothers. The Creek runs through our veins now.**

"I can‚Äôt take the lack of acceptance anymore, what should I do?","

Me (20) and my father (54) live together in an apartment. He does not support my transition and it hurts so much. I‚Äôve been transitioning for around 16 months now and he still refuses to use my chosen name and pronouns. Whenever we try to talk about it and I call him out, even in the slightest it always turns into a toxic shouting and bitching fest. The other day he told me he was praying the trans away at church, without even being prompted.

However, ignoring the transgender stuff my father is very supportive and kind to me. He has been like my best friend for my entire life. Hell, the other day he took me to buffalo wild wings because he saw I was sad. Recently he also took me on a road trip just to hang out, and it went great. Lately I have been going through an awful depression/anxiety/ocd episode. He has been helpful by playing Minecraft with me and watching YouTube videos with me. I feel so entitled and selfish to expect him to support my transgender identity.

I am so hurt because I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation, my father‚Äôs toxicity to my transition is destroying me because I feel so freaking guilty for being trans and taking hormones. At the same time I can‚Äôt really cut him out of my life because he obviously loves me.

Honestly I‚Äôm such a fuck up. Last month I already told him that his (and the rest of the families) lack of support is making me want to detrans. I can‚Äôt take this, I‚Äôve already waved the white flag. I‚Äôve already lost. It‚Äôs over. I‚Äôve wanted to be a woman my whole life but I need to accept I can‚Äôt have it. I‚Äôm a burden to my family 

Yes, in case any of you are wondering, yes I am feeling suicidal. I don‚Äôt want to tell him though because that seems manipulative and I don‚Äôt want to make him feel bad. I feel so greedy and selfish, some people get kicked out of the house or treated like crap by their parents. Meanwhile this is my main issue with him and it‚Äôs tearing me apart, ain‚Äôt I spoiled.

My best friend keeps picking fights with me and I don't know why,"My (f16) best friend (f17) have been best friends for over a year, and we've known each other for a few years. I have a diagnosis for GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), Severe Clinical Depression (with suicidal tendencies), ADHD, and I'm on the autism spectrum. My best friend, let's call her Mary, has a girlfriend (f17). They've been (unofficially?) dating for maybe a month (I think less) and Mary keeps pushing me aside for her girlfriend. I understand that your S/O is closer and more intimate than your bestie, but she keeps sending mixed signals and it's very confusing for me.

A few days ago, I almost committed suicide. I had a really bad episode with a family member and it left me suicidal while at home alone for hours. I called my bestie and she stayed on the phone, but wasn't talking to me. She was texting her gf and talking to her siblings. I hung up because I was starting to get upset at her and didnt want to be a bother, and then shut my phone off because I needed some peace and quiet. She texted me the next morning saying she hoped I was okay.

Another time, I was driving home and called her because I was very upset and having an episode due to more family drama. She answered the phone, but ignored me the whole time. I could hear her listening to voice messages from her girlfriend, and I could hear her recording new voice messages to her. When I tried to get her attention, it took multiple attempts for her to respond. When I asked her what I was talking about, she had no idea. I just hung up and cried the rest of the way home, fighting the urge to crash my car because I felt alone and rejected.

Another time, she came over to my house. The whole time, she was on her phone talking to (surprise!) her gf. She wasn't involved in our conversation, because from the minute she walked in the door all she could do was talk to her gf. I eventually gave up and went to my bed and began having a depressive episode. She came in my room, bugged me for my computer password, and then played games on my PC and talked to her gf until she had to leave. Didn't care about trying to talk to me IN MY OWN HOUSE.

There have been multiple occasions like this.

Before she had a gf, whenever I would be upset she would notice and actually talk to me. Now it feels like I'm just an extra in her life. Like she doesn't even care. But when I try to distance from her, to try and make it hurt less, she gets upset and picks a fight with me. When I try to explain to her how I feel, she plays the victim and gaslights/manipulates me. ""Oh so I'm crazy."" ""Oh so I'm just a bad friend."" Sometimes she'll say stuff like ""You're right, sorry for being such a bitch"" and then get mad when I say she isn't a bitch.

Back when she was with one of her exes, she talked about how she liked playing victim. She said a lot of stuff about how she likes playing victim, and how she thinks she has BPD (borderline personality disorder). Ever since she found out what BPD is, she's molded her entire personality around that disorder even though she doesn't have a diagnosis. I knew her before she knew about it, and she was different. Now she uses her undiagnosed ""BPD"" as an excuse for her to act this way.

Now to the reason I finally decided to make this post:
Today, we had a good day. No arguments, disagreements, fights, nothing. She came over to my house after school so I could drive her to work (it's only 5 minutes away and she isn't allowed to learn to drive) so I drive her sometimes when she doesn't have another ride. We hung out for a few before I drove her to work, and everything was fine. However, she was on the phone with her gf, and her gf got mad at me because I asked about her mom. We were trying to play a sleepover this weekend, and I said ""Why don't you invite your gf"" because she always talks about how she wants to hang out with her and I wanted her to be happy. Then she says that her gf (let's call her Ellie) couldn't come because her step-dad would say no (he's an asshole). I said ""Why doesn't she ask her mom?"" because her mom is nice, and last time we asked her smth she said yes. Mary (my bestie) said no, and continued talking. I didnt understand why she couldn't ask, so I kept pushing for Ellie to ask her mom. Mary just said ""Hop off that for now"" which I didnt understand, because we were just talking about it and now it's a problem? then Mary hangs up with her gf so I cam drive her to work, and I ask about it. Apparently her gf (who was on the phone in Mary's headphones so I couldn't hear her) said she was thinking about how she was gonna beat/kill me (not a serious literal statement, just something she says to say she's mad at someone) because I was talking about her mom. I asked why and Mary told me that basically, her mom and step-dad are getting a divorce, and her step-dad kicked her mom out of the house. I genuinely had no idea of any of this, as the last time we talked about Ellie's mom everything was fine (just a few days ago). The fact that Ellie was so upset at me for something I didnt know about made me upset, and so we were both upset at each other. This made Mary upset, so when she got to work (she can he on her phone when it's not busy, and today wasn't a busy day) she made a group chat with the three of us. She said she wanted us to make up, and also said that she ""doesnt want to have to choose between the two of us"" which doesn't make sense to me, because she's been choosing her gf every single fucking time. While she was at work, my dad got on to me about a bunch of shit and it made me even more upset. I told Mary that I was too upset to talk in the group chat about the issue at the time, because my dad had yelled at me about stuff. I told her that I would talk about it when I wasn't angry so that I wouldn't make things worse. This made Mary very upset, and after a few messages she said ""you don't have to say anything, just read what I wrote."" So I did, and I put a reaction emoji to her messages so she knew I read them (I always do this with her so she doesn't get upset thinking I didnt read her texts) And she texted me again, this time accusing me of ""dissing her feelings"". I reminded her that I was really upset and that she said that I could just read her messages and that i didnt have to say anything right now. She then said ""Just forget it. Hope your chores are going great."" (chores are one of the many things my dad was yelling at me about and I told her that) and said she'd get a ride home with someone from work. She's clearly angry with me, but I don't know what to do and whether I did anything wrong.

She is excited about a romantic relationship, and as much as it sucks, new romances tend to completely overwhelm a person‚Äôs thoughts. Hormones will do that. Her girlfriend sees you as a threat and is trying to push you away. The only way to deal with that is to be friendly, but not try to force friendship with her. Nobody can predict the future, but as you and Mary mature, you will either drift apart or you will learn how to balance your friendship with your romantic lives. In other words, even though this is hard to believe, you are going through relationship pains that many people go through, and with resilience and maturity you will learn to better navigate these situations. \n\nMore concerning is your overall mental health. If you are not already doing so, my advice to you would be to seek counseling services at your school, with a teacher, with a doctor, or a mental health professional.

Overwhelmed,"Around a month ago I made a post asking about Life Insurance and DIC payments in the event of suicide. 
I made plans and intentions to end my life, but posed the question as if it were for a friend. 

You all told me that no amount of money, would replace me in my wife‚Äôs life. 

I didn‚Äôt believe you then, but I took your advise and went in again for a check up at my psychiatrists. 

I felt Isolated, as if no one would ever understand what I had witnessed and that I would rather escape this guilt and silence buried in my soul. 
I wanted my emotions to run on the pavement, to somehow atone for what I‚Äôve done. 

I can say with confidence today doesn‚Äôt change everything, but it shows me that I was validated in how I feel, and that suffering with PTSD wasn‚Äôt just something in my own head. 

I‚Äôm so thankful to all of you who told me to stick in the fight. 
I‚Äôm so thankful to those of you who shared that you endured what I‚Äôve endured, and that my combat trauma was real.

Is my therapist in the wrong or am I? What would you do? ,"TW: self harm & suicidal ideation. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but since my therapist is ‚Äúemotional abuse‚Äù focused and trauma informed, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs appropriate.   
   
   I‚Äôve been seeing my therapist for 2.5 years. Initially I felt like she was very helpful. I knew my relationship wasnt ok when I found her, but I questioned everything and she really helped me get back to reality (I was convinced I was a narcissist and the abusive one). So again, sessions seemed helpful the first year or so.   
   
   Here are some recent things that concern me, but I don‚Äôt know if this is just what healing is supposed to look like‚Ä¶.   
   
   - Ive noticed that every time I drive to therapy I feel so sick to my stomach and usually cry before I even arrive. It takes everything in my being to walk through that door.   
   - After therapy, I feel so much worse about myself. The only days I self harm are the days I have therapy.   
   - She has told me to stop interrupting her twice. Every time I‚Äôve done this, it‚Äôs when she‚Äôs telling me her perception about something but she has a fact or experience wrong. I interrupt her to correct her so she doesn‚Äôt explain some idea based off incorrect facts. I‚Äôve explained this but shes never really reacted.   
   - I‚Äôve told her SO many times that I have breakdowns where I scream, sob, hit myself in the face, end up self harming. She gave me the usual advice of breathing, going on a walk, taking a bath, drinking tea (lol). One day in session I felt a breakdown coming on. Instead of waiting until I was in my car, I let myself have the breakdown in her office. No one, I mean NO ONE, has ever seen this. It was scary but I thought it could be helpful to have her witness what I go through regularly. She acted completely shocked and terrified by my breakdown. This was really hard to take, as it made me feel like a monster. But what REALLY knocked the wind out of me was when she asked ‚Äúhas that ever happened before?‚Äù. I reminded her that I have talked about these breakdowns consistently and she said she didn‚Äôt think they were actually as bad as I described.   
   - I explained how forcing myself to have sex with my fianc√© is extremely painful and destroying. Ive never ever used these words, because my fianc√© has never been forceful (coercion through silent treatment is it) and although it even feels a bit dramatic to me, I finally stated that ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm having to be raped every week‚Äù. Her only response was ‚Äúthat sounds difficult‚Äù and then a blank stare. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm expecting here, or what a therapist could actually do in this situation? But that response made me feel really alone and really helpless.   
   
   I know therapists are humans and of course I don‚Äôt expect her to be perfect. This is why I‚Äôm struggling; I can‚Äôt discern what‚Äôs acceptable and what‚Äôs not in a therapeutic environment. But above all, I feel I‚Äôve really regressed in the last year and feel so much more hopeless and defeated.   
   
   Is this all normal? Am I being way too hard on my therapist and it‚Äôs just a hard process overall? Lastly, I have a session with her tomorrow and planning on asking her if she feels I‚Äôve made any progress. Are there any other questions I could ask that might help me dictate if she‚Äôs a good fit or not? If you‚Äôve made it this far, I really appreciate your time and kindness ‚ô•Ô∏è",1b1u2ke,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1b1u2ke/is_my_therapist_in_the_wrong_or_am_i_what_would/,"['Thank you for posting in r/abusiverelationships.

As you said, therapists are human (i‚Äôm training to be one) & though they try to keep their best face on, sometimes avoiding an emotional reaction is extremely difficult if someone is in extreme distress or in a very difficult situation (like your breakdown, or the r*pe). The thing is, though, if YOU don‚Äôt feel comfortable with her or feel like she‚Äôs the best, then you should switch therapists. it could come down to her being a bad fit for you. \n\nwhen it comes to you self-harming on days you have therapy, that‚Äôs pretty common because you‚Äôre experiencing big emotions after being forced to think & talk about them during therapy. therapy isn‚Äôt rly a preventative measure from keeping you from doing these things; it‚Äôs more of a long-term solution that will eventually help your self-esteem rise so that you don‚Äôt feel the need to cope by harming yourself + it will help you develop other coping methods over time. \n\nthe interruption thing might be just because she wants to finish her thought & have you react to her full thought in case there‚Äôs other details she wants to add. i‚Äôm not necessarily defending her because as i said, she might not be a good fit for you if you feel that something is wrong. \n\nall the details you‚Äôve provided sound pretty typical of a therapist to me. but just to reiterate again, it‚Äôs up to you whether or not YOU think she‚Äôs a good therapist for YOU.']"
My mother is making me suicidal ,"TW!!!!!

My mother is actively making me suicidal, and if things don‚Äôt change I won‚Äôt be on this earth anymore and I‚Äôll no longer be a burden to my mom. She blames me for being disabled, she tells me I can‚Äôt do anything. Like I got a job interview at a car wash place, and I got told I can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù but I‚Äôm honestly needing a job. 

I won‚Äôt hurt myself I promise!!!",1b1u1yb,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1b1u1yb/my_mother_is_making_me_suicidal/,"[""Yeah that sounds bad good on you for getting the job interview! Maybe she doesn't blame you for being disabled but she just worried about what could happen or she just doesn't want you working there for a diffrent reason"", 'You can do anything that you put your mind to if you believe that you can.\n\nSometimes, our parents are not the most supportive, and it can make things even more difficult. However, if you believe in yourself that you can do something, then you can. You could try talking to your mother less, and doing the things you need to do more. This way, you will show your mom that you are working and that you are capable. When she sees that you are really doing it, she will no longer be able to deny your ability.']"
IOS Plex app mobile app screen rotation,Hello :) im using plex shortly and decided to buy plex via monthly subscription.

I have an intake appt for IOP tomorrow and I‚Äôm worried about possible involuntary hold ,"Long story short, I am having an intake appointment tomorrow for IOP for a substance abuse program, specifically to get off benzos that I am not currently abusing but I am physically dependent on, have a constant desire to abuse and need to get off of for good. I have been struggling heavily with suicidal ideation, depression and derealization and tonight while trying to overcome the urge to abuse my meds I ended up punching my wall repeatedly and my hand is visibly injured. Could this impact my appointment tomorrow and get me sent to inpatient? The IOP is at a center, not a hospital. 

I‚Äôm just trying to be prepared, as past involuntary holds were fairly traumatic.

Foul play not a factor in death of Dan Corrales,"He shot himself. In the chest. He died of blood loss. Alcohol and Valium in his system. Judge Cobos ruled it accidental because a note was not found. He worked for the county as an assistant DA. His family owns a business. He was at large city council rep. He was a good dude. 
I promise you, judge cobos would not do that if it were one of us. 
This way his family gets death benefits. I‚Äôm ok with that. But if it were just one of us average citizens, it would be suicide. I feel like they take care of their own, same as no criminal charges when the train hit the veterans float, because everyone was involved, no one got charged. I wonder how often this happens that we don‚Äôt know about ?",1b1u0qj,10,4,https://www.mrt.com/news/article/foul-play-determined-not-factor-death-councilman-18691859.php,"['Judge Cobos is a good dude.\n\ni usually trust wizened judges, they‚Äôve seen some shit.', 'Still‚Ä¶unless the deceased has a devout Catholic family‚Ä¶there‚Äôs no reason to try to convince the public it wasn‚Äôt suicide.\n\nSuicidal people often choose ineffective/idiotic/inefficient methods to attempt to kill themselves.

I'm scared of dating because I have too low self-esteem,"I'm too scared to let others close, because I don't like myself very much. I grew up very isolated and controlled by family, who never had anything nice to say to me. Everything about me was always criticized, and I was beaten a lot too. I have been suicidal since I was 12, and have made many attempts in the past. I'm finally just starting to show myself some care, taking care of my hygiene, buying myself nice things, trying to make my life more comfortable. But I cannot bring myself to date or even open up to friends. I truthfully do not really consider myself a human being. I think I'm a horrible subhuman creature, and that if anyone ever got close enough to see it, they would abuse me like my family does. That would break me. If someone other than my family abused me, then I would lose hope in life and give up entirely. Because it means everything they said was true all along. That I'm a disgusting, worthless thing, only acceptable when I am useful and do as I am told. And I'm very affectionate person, I can get attached so quickly. It's very pathetic how easy it is for others to make me like them. I'm so starved for affection and kindness, even the smallest compliment make me cry and go a little crazy. I am so aware how much power imbalance there would be, and it is so scary. I am such a doormat and have so little self-esteem, my entire life just always being crushed and broken down. How can I have healthy relationships and friendships? Few friendships I had, I was being exploited. I just running errands, doing homework, buying gifts, food, cooking, cleaning. Nobody in my life has been nice to me without making me do so much for them. It's like I am born and live to be a servant. I'm so exhausted, I just want it all to end. I just want someone to like me. I just want someone to be nice to me, I want someone to do nice things for me too. I want someone to make me feel human. But I'm too afraid. I don't think I'm good enough or deserve it. I can't ever be cool or normal about anything, I want to spill my guts whenever someone flirting with me. My immediate reaction when anyone expresses interest, is to tell them how much of a broken and abused creature I am. I feel like they deserve to know, that otherwise I am deceiving them. They should know I am a disgusting creature, that is difficult to put up with. But that is crazy isn't it? It's crazy to respond to flirtation by telling person all the worst things my abusers say about me. It makes me easy target for bad person. I'm so torn up, between not wishing to trick someone into thinking I am a human and wanting to bury my past and not be abused anymore. I'm so terrified of letting anyone close, but I want it so much. Why was I born to be nothing but a maid and punching bag? I wish I never was. I'm so broken and sensitive, I need to hear some kindness. There is nothing but evil, bad, mocking voices in my head. Why? What did I ever do to any of them? It must be because I am a terrible subhuman creature. How can something like me ever find love and friendship? I know I will be easy prey for bad person. I practically tell them exactly how they can hurt me and manipulate me. But if I don't I feel like I'm a terrible liar and will be despised when they find out the truth. So I hide away in my room and do not speak to anyone. I never return affections and reject everyone. Even though it hurt so much, even though I want to be happy. I can't.

Leaving Voluntary Admission Early,"My wife voluntarily admitted herself to a mental health facility, can she leave before the initial 72 hours is up?

She admitted herself for suicidal ideation, but being there is making things worse. They took her birth control, her phone, and aren't allowing her visitors. All she can really do all day is sit around. All that is making her anxiety and stress worse, so she wants to leave.

We live in Virginia, and she's been there for just under 24 hours. When she stated she wanted to leave, they said she needed to give 48 hours notice. Is that accurate? As her spouse, am I able to get her out early?

Looking into this I've come across a lot of horror stories, so I'm now really worried about her staying. ",1b1tzdj,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1b1tzdj/leaving_voluntary_admission_early/,"['Where are you located? In most states a voluntary commitment is still minimum 72 hours. Which is contingent upon the evaluation and often can last a week or longer. And yes, typically a stay requires a 48 hour notice to request to leave so the care team can evaluate.  Nothing you‚Äôve described is atypical in regards to the birth control (or any medication), phone and no visitors. Same for much of it possibly being sitting around. Emergency inpatient is intended to stabilize people in crisis and not provide intensive therapy or provide a long term fix.']"
The allegations,"When allegations about antisemitism and racism (unfounded accusations mind you) came out they weren't taken this seriously. Which I find disgusting. If it takes abuse accusations from years ago when someone was in a mental health crisis due to their depression to stop supporting them then you never really supported them to begin with.

I, like Wilbur, suffer with diagnosed depression. Not the ""uwu quirky I'm so sad"" depression that is glorified by social media. Actual depression. Depression hurts you and the people around you. I've done so many shitty things while in a depressive state. I suicide baited my ex, I hurt someone during sex because I disassociated so hard due to my trauma with sex I don't even remember what happened, I pushed my ex to the floor to get her away from me, I yelled at people, I hurt people very deeply. THAT is what depression does. You aren't just sad. If you think any of that makes you a bad person then stop pretending to support people with depression. You only support palatable mental illness.

As a victim of abuse and SA I'm not saying Shelby is wrong, but this should've been kept private. We shouldn't know about this. Someone's most intimate and private mental health struggles shouldn't be broadcast online, and that includes hers. It was wildly unhealthy for her to cope this way. As a victim myself I understand the want to get revenge on your abuser, to make them hurt the way they hurt you, but this isn't going to bring her any peace nor will it bring her closure or healing. This is only going to cause her more grief. The only reason things like this should be made public is if the abuser puts other people in danger, which Wilbur (as far as Shelby has demonstrated) isn't.

I haven't watched Wilbur in a long time. I just listen to his music now, but just by listening to his music, through his lyrics, this kind of thing shouldn't be surprising to you. He sings about how he was a bad person in the past, how he struggled with relationships, why is it shocking he was a bad person in the past who struggled with a relationship?

Again, all my love to Shelby for being a survivor of abuse, but she should not have made this public. All this situation has done has made people with diagnosed depression (just like Wilbur and myself) feel like they're terrible people for what they did during their depressive episodes. Yes, take accountability for the harm you caused during those depressive episodes, but don't call them a terrible person for what they did during those depressive episodes. 

If you are reading this and you feel the same way I feel right now I have one message for you: As long as you've done all you can to fix the harm you've caused, you are not a bad person. And I'm sorry people are making it out to be like the way you act during a mental health crisis years ago says anything about your current character.",1b1tyo9,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wilbursoot/comments/1b1tyo9/the_allegations/,"['[deleted]', 'I think she has the right to talk about this as she wants, and in her vod she said she doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs the last person he would hurt like that. He‚Äôs a well-known figure, it makes sense to speak out about it if you think he‚Äôd hurt other people the same way. She also said that staying quiet was only keeping her abusers peace, not hers. \n\nFurthermore, clearly he‚Äôs hurt a lot of other cc‚Äôs based on billzo, freddie, and Niki‚Äôs statement. They all have the right to speak out as they want, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a sense of peace and freedom in seeing people speak out against the guy who‚Äôs hurt you. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to tell them to prioritize the mental health of a guy who clearly never gave a shit about theirs. \n\nNo one is owed help by people they hurt. I do believe in second chances (and more), but there‚Äôs no accountability in that apology, and Shelby said she doesn‚Äôt accept it. If you hurt people during your depressive episodes, that is a bad thing, and depression doesn‚Äôt actually excuse it.']"

Today it's the closest I have been to suicide.,"I have been in a pretty rough mental state since start of last year.

At first, I was pretty well and could handle it. And I couldn't go to high school, so I was mostly doing the studying at home (something I have wanted for all my life, as I struggle at school and cannot be homeschooled). I felt a bit worse and very lonely at the middle of 2023 (when I started school again, though it didn't bother me as much as other things), but I started writing and that kept sane. 

But around December, everything quickly started going down: I was forced to share a lot of time with my uncles which I hate due to being narcissistic assholes that constantly get my mom into trouble and traumatized me as a child, I felt insanely anxious and incompetent at everything, I constantly got either stressed or distracted so I couldn't do any of my hobbies, the dictators of my country for some fucking reason started to threaten one of their neighbors with war for no reason and a lot of other things were happening making me overwhelmed for the whole month.

Then I literally had an hour long breakdown in New Years Eve at my Aunt's house, and my bitch aunt saw me having a breakdown I said that I didn't need her help and then her son (which is a Level 2 autistic 17 year old, I am also diagnosed with autism though a less ""severe"" level of it) got confused and tried to grab my phone, this cousin was related to some of the trauma I mentioned earlier so fearing that it might worsen the breakdown or that he might just plainly take my phone, I agressively grab the phone and told him to leave. My aunt then started screeching about how I hated her son and practically calling me a bad person and family member (ignoring that I am literally one of the most caring people to her other kid), now I recognize this wasn't the best way to treat someone like him but I was already deep into the breakdown and I wasn't thinking logically at the time and just wanted to get out of the house (which I couldn't do), I tried to apologize but she believed I wasn't being genuine and insulted me again. Then she went to complain with her husband. I then got out of the house after they allowed me, and basically cried for like 20 minutes.

There I realized that I belonged nowhere in life. I never felt part of my extended family, all my friends either went away or I hated them and my only friend at the time was being abused physically by their mother and didn't want to talk to anyone, I am not religious unlike most of my country and loved ones, I never felt part of any community or part of my own country and culture. I also felt guilty and bad due to leaving the house, because I have isolated myself all my life due to my ego and autism, I said to myself at the start of the year that I would get over that but I couldn't and basically acomplished nothing during the year except getting depressed and regressing back to the self harm and breakdowns I regularly had before the quarantine (which literally saved my life and relationship with my sister and parents).

Since then I just have been going even deeper into the spiral, I have mental breaks due to small things every few days (including at school), my mind cannot stop bringing back my trauma and guilt from an event when I was 8 when I masturbated next to my sister thinking about her (I think I am not an incestuous scumbag, I was 8 and had no awareness of sex or masturbation, she didn't realize that I was doing that and I have shown no signs of incest since then and I am deeply disgusted by the event and 
by incest in general. That still doesn't remove the fear, though) and I recently have started to have suicidal and intrusive thoughts and disassociating. I have tried to use comedy to cope (this is always one of my healthier coping methods, the other ones include things like excessive eating or drinking) but it isn't really working and I cannot manage to be funny without getting stressed over the reaction of others to my attempts at comedy or getting sad because I don't feel that I am as creative with it as before.
 
I hit rock bottom today however, I am recovering from a nasty fever and throats irritation which left me at my room isolated for a week. And now I get anxious every time I get out of my room. A few minutes ago, I had yet another mental break that included paranoia, flashbacks from trauma and disassociation. I usually become frantic and talk very quickly or weird during or after one of these attacks. My mom came back from her work stressed and tired and was very angry at the mess I made the house (I was alone and didn't have the energy to clean) she heard me talking weird and said to me that I stopped talking and acting crazy and complained about me being messy, then she brought up that I have like 10 works to do for school. I got mad at her (I didn't yell or anything her, I just left the room)  and then I passed by the stairs of my house. And then almost jumped trying to fall, I stopped myself. But I have never been that close to suicide in my life (being suicidal is also not new to me as I have been suicidal since 10 and I think I subconsciously attempted suicide at 11 via putting a metal object in the outlet).

I don't know where to go now, everything around me seems hopeless and I feel like I have nowhere to go or anything to do. I am currently awaiting a therapy session but it was delayed and I feel I cannot handle much more. I am also facing extreme paranoia, stress and anxiety over my inactive long time paraphilic disorder (the first instance of it was at 6), which I feel might be starting to affect my psyche and giving my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder over the shit I saw and consumed due to it. I also cannot talk about it to anyone, as it wold drive away my only loved ones (I swear it's not anything illegal though it is extremely messed up and reached a very creepy degree).",1b1tv8v,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1b1tv8v/today_its_the_closest_i_have_been_to_suicide/,[]
Aaron Bushnell reactions is making me sick in the stomach,"I dont usually get effected by wordwide politics  in any physical way. But this is diffrent. Im feeling myself getting more radicalised, more doompilled and more cynical then ever. I feel sheer hatred and disgust rushing through my spine while im reading comments about this situation in other subreddits.

The complete mocking, indiffrence, projecting, lying and speculating on Aaron Bushnells motivations and mind is straight up inhuman.

Its not lost uppon me that the whole point of self-immolation is to be as brutal as possible and shocking. And that real people all around the world experiences the same brutality and death on a daily basis. And that im making this about me and my feelings.

But still i cant believe people are not willing to give an ounce of charitability to someone who felt such a strong sense of empathy for his fellow man that he publicly took his own life in the most brutal way possible to bring attention to the injustice.

Suicide is not easy. Its horrible in all ways imaginable. And as long as they dont take anyone else with them, nobody deserves to be mocked and laughed at for it.

Idk why these comments effected me so much more then they normally do. Right now i just feel like throwing up and never have faith in humans ever. Fucking disgusting.

I really don't think I can do college,"I (18F) feel so lost in what direction I want my life to go. I just want to escape my abusive family and be happy.  
  
I was one of the most hardworking, overachieving, active students in high school. I was in the Top 10% of my class, I took APs, I worked, I was the leader of multiple clubs, and I took an active role in advocating for my school district. After working hard for so long, it became worth it when I got into a very competitive, highly ranked school with great financial aid. I didn't even have to maintain a certain GPA, just pass my classes, get a degree, and get into a good job afterwards.  
  
I majored in Electrical Engineering because of the high demand and great pay, and I was interested in working with circuit boards and building things. I worked so hard for all of this because I thought that's was I was going to be, independent at this far away school where I could get away from my abusive (emotionally and physically) family. Everyone would always tell me what a great opportunity it was, and it did start out great.  
  
I was making friends, I joined clubs, I went out often, and I was attending my classes. Everything on the outside seemed great, but I ended up taking a leave of absence after a suicide attempt in the first semester. I felt so overworked and burnt out, I couldn't pay attention in my classes, I didn't have the energy to do any work, and the course load was overwhelming. I tried everything to improve my situation. I was working with my academic advisor, I kept in frequent contact with my professors, I went to office hours, I went to tutoring, and I was in therapy through the university, but nothing got better. I even tried taking less classes, switching classes around, and switched majors a couple times. Eventually, I just ended up taking a leave of absence after my suicide attempt.  
  
After I left, I ended up in a psych ward for 2 weeks, and was in a partial care program after for about a week. Even though my mood definitely stabilized after that time, I still was struggling trying to figure out what to do. While I was there, I tried talking to a bunch of different adults I met, but they really only said things like ""you're young, you have time to figure things out don't worry about it"".  
  
Since then, I've been working back at my high school job at home, and fell into another depressive episode in December. I just feel so lost and aimless, and I've been fighting with my family because they want me to go back to college. I ended up attempting again in January, and ended up at another psych ward for about a week. I'm now in a different therapy program as well as having regular appointments with my primary therapist (I've had her for around 4 years now).  
  
I just had another appointment yesterday, and my therapist wants me to go back to school as well. I genuinely don't think I can tolerate being in that environment again, but I'm scared about what else I can do with my life. More than anything, I want to get out of this house and maybe move into an apartment with my gf (18f) by the end of this year or early next year. Honestly though, I'm scared that might be unrealistic given the state of the economy. For now, I've just been applying to other jobs and thinking about getting into investment.  
  
I'm just at a loss for what to do, it feels like I've been doing nothing but I don't want to go back to school. Is everyone else right?",1b1tr0e,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1b1tr0e/i_really_dont_think_i_can_do_college/,"['No, you are totally right. Even young adults have the right to have a depressive episode. What you can do is to try and go to college IF you feel comfortable. You should be able to stand that thought before going back to college. Right now you should wait and see if that opportunity comes. If it does, take less classes per semester, manage your time, and try to keep it good! Hope you go through the episode.']"

Boyfriend refuses to give me instructions on how to not be abused,"Ive been abused by my boyfriend for the past 8 months on the basis that I developed depression and became suicidal. I recently stopped discussing my suicidal tendencies, depression, or any negative feelings at all in hopes that he'll stop abusing me, as he said he only abused me because of those things. His new reasoning for his abuse is that I ""used to talk about those things and the scars will never heal"" and that ""the love I show him is fake and clearly done out of fear"". I requested instructions on how I can be better so there could be a chance he'd abuse me less, but he refused, even when I asked for them as a birthday gift. I understand that abusers will always find a reason to abuse someone, but I am hoping that if I can be good, he'll at least abuse me LESS. I am willing to be with him, even if he still continues to abuse me this much. I'm just hoping I could finally get him to abuse me less, like maybe once every other day instead of daily.

P-3: The Case for Midas,"Yeah, yeah, I've seen the screenshot. I know Hakita has come out saying that having a character named Midas would be stupid.

That being said, as far as I'm aware he's never actually explicitly stated that it won't be the case, so why not have a bit of fun?



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Let's start off with the obvious reasons why this could be possible. Popular Greek king in line with the other Prime bosses, extremely well-known and understood. Great. That being said, his golden touch would likely clash with the Greed aesthetic, and there's already someone there.

Except... the story of Midas and his golden touch is only one half of his story. The best-known half, to be sure, but not the only half.

The first part of Midas' story is simple. The satyr Silenus, a companion of Dionysus, gets drunk and passes out in a field. Several peasants find him laying there, and bring him to the king of Phrygia, Midas. Recognizing the satyr, Midas makes sure to treat him well, entertaining him while providing all the gifts of hospitality. In thanks for his actions, Dionysus grants him a single wish.

As we all know, Midas wishes to turn whatever he touches into gold, and ends up turning his daughter into a statue.

Now, this is a greedy wish for sure, but in the end, Midas never truly did anything so worthy of punishment. Beyond attempting to gain more than he was owed, Midas' actions were still benevolent, and as such, he was spared to an extent. Dionysus ends up allowing Midas to cleanse his own curse by washing himself in the Pactolus River, which also allows him to bring anything he golded back to life.

The point I'm trying to make here is simple. Midas did not carry his sin beyond his life. His greed was quite literally washed away, and he never relapsed back into it. Honestly, I wouldn't be too surprised if a Midas boss didn't have gold powers at all. It's something that he overcame, not a sin that was buried with him. It wouldn't make sense to lump him in with Sisyphus, who was greedy to the very end.





Now, if his golden touch is not an option, what's left to use?

Well, the second part of Midas' narrative. His donkey ears. Yes, you're seeing that right.

Basically, Midas ends up becoming a follower of the satyr/music god Pan, and is asked to judge a music contest between him and the god Apollo alongside the mountain god Tmolus. Off the bat, Apollo is the much bigger deal here, given his power as one of the twelve most important gods in Greece, but he's also the bigger god of music.

When they play, Pan's melody is very appealing to Midas, but it's still a very rustic melody befitting his status as god of the wild. Then, Apollo strums his lyre.

Immediately, Tmolus awards the competition to Apollo, but Midas stands firm, asserting that he enjoyed Pan's playing better. In typical Greek god fashion, Apollo gets pissed and remarks that Midas must have ""the ears of an ass!"" This immediately comes true as Midas sprouts a pair of donkey ears from atop his head.

Obviously, this greatly embarrassed Midas. He's a king, and he can't be looking like that in public, so he covers it up with a pair of donkey ears. There's only one person who is allowed to see the top of his head: his barber, who swears to never mention it again. He fails to keep his promise.

One day, the barber can't take it anymore, digging a hole into the earth in which to speak the secret. He doesn't intend to say it to anyone, but given this is a greek myth, nothing is ever simple. From the covered-up hole sprouts a bunch of reeds, which whisper Midas' best kept secret every time the winds whisper through them. The rumor spreads, Midas is ashamed, and eventually takes his own life.





Let's break this down. Off the bat, Midas died to suicide, one of the sins punished in the layer of Violence from Dante's Inferno. On top of that, his suicide was caused by the betrayal of his barber, who spilled his secret. Treachery.

Now, when I first thought about this, I wasn't super convinced by the above. It's an indirect connection, and it could be someone else. However, when I took a deeper look, I found something that immediately tipped me off to the possibility.

The way Midas committed suicide has been suggested by several sources, from Plutarch to Strabo, but there's a fairly consistent theme among them. Midas poisoned himself with powdered realgar, a substance high in arsenic. This compound wasn't called realgar at the time, instead going by a very particular name...





Bull's blood, a substance that was often used as a red pigment for paints.

Around this time it was my first semester in college and I insisted in using my left hand for everything but then it got so tired and eventually the same exact problem occurred. I felt like everything was over and I would fail my classes but I turned out to ace my classes and meet a bunch of friends. Fast Foward to a week before the semester ends, I somehow injure my foot through soccer and was forced to walk on it my last week of classes. My entire winter break sucked because of my foot and I tried to go second semester but I just couldn‚Äôt, I was forced to withdraw and it‚Äôs been 3 months and I have been unable to walk. I‚Äôve been at home but i‚Äôve been going out and i‚Äôve overused my left foot. I‚Äôve been trying to stop but yesterday it got to the point where i can‚Äôt even  put pressure on my left foot. I was hopeful that things were finally getting better for my right foot but yesterday I just got shut down again. I don‚Äôt know what to do, it doesn‚Äôt feel like any of this will go away, especially since some of the symptoms i have might be of Nerve related issues. I‚Äôve just been laying in bed but I can‚Äôt even enjoy things like video games or guitar anymore because I still have issues with my weak wrists. I wanted to resolve my wrist issues but all of a sudden my foot issues came up. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll be able ever to walk like i used to and i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll be able to enjoy the things i used to love. It feels like everything is over for me, i can‚Äôt really do anything anymore. I know i‚Äôm only 18 but it seriously feels like everything is over. I feel like such a burden for my family, especially financially because i‚Äôm seeing doctors almost every week. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore i‚Äôve been having suicidal thoughts but I don‚Äôt even want that, I just want to be normal again.

Can I be happy in life without going to college?,"I (18F) feel so lost in what direction I want my life to go. I just want to escape my abusive family and be happy.  
  
I was one of the most hardworking, overachieving, active students in high school. I was in the Top 10% of my class, I took APs, I worked, I was the leader of multiple clubs, and I took an active role in advocating for my school district. After working hard for so long, it became worth it when I got into a very competitive, highly ranked school with great financial aid. I didn't even have to maintain a certain GPA, just pass my classes, get a degree, and get into a good job afterwards.  
  
I majored in Electrical Engineering because of the high demand and great pay, and I was interested in working with circuit boards and building things. I worked so hard for all of this because I thought that's was I was going to be, independent at this far away school where I could get away from my abusive (emotionally and physically) family. Everyone would always tell me what a great opportunity it was, and it did start out great.  
  
I was making friends, I joined clubs, I went out often, and I was attending my classes. Everything on the outside seemed great, but I ended up taking a leave of absence after a suicide attempt in the first semester. I felt so overworked and burnt out, I couldn't pay attention in my classes, I didn't have the energy to do any work, and the course load was overwhelming. I tried everything to improve my situation. I was working with my academic advisor, I kept in frequent contact with my professors, I went to office hours, I went to tutoring, and I was in therapy through the university, but nothing got better. I even tried taking less classes, switching classes around, and switched majors a couple times. Eventually, I just ended up taking a leave of absence after my suicide attempt.  
  
After I left, I ended up in a psych ward for 2 weeks, and was in a partial care program after for about a week. Even though my mood definitely stabilized after that time, I still was struggling trying to figure out what to do. While I was there, I tried talking to a bunch of different adults I met, but they really only said things like ""you're young, you have time to figure things out don't worry about it"".  
  
Since then, I've been working back at my high school job at home, and fell into another depressive episode in December. I just feel so lost and aimless, and I've been fighting with my family because they want me to go back to college. I ended up attempting again in January, and ended up at another psych ward for about a week. I'm now in a different therapy program as well as having regular appointments with my primary therapist (I've had her for around 4 years now).  
  
I just had another appointment yesterday, and my therapist wants me to go back to school as well. I genuinely don't think I can tolerate being in that environment again, but I'm scared about what else I can do with my life. More than anything, I want to get out of this house and maybe move into an apartment with my gf (18f) by the end of this year or early next year. Honestly though, I'm scared that might be unrealistic given the state of the economy. For now, I've just been applying to other jobs and thinking about getting into investment.  
  
I'm just at a loss for what to do, it feels like I've been doing nothing but I don't want to go back to school. Is everyone else right?",1b1ti72,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1b1ti72/can_i_be_happy_in_life_without_going_to_college/,[]
Why do I smell?,"It all started in junior year of high school I became very sweaty more than normal. I never knew why but because of this I stink from my underarms. I can't smell it personally because I've had it for so long I'm 31 now but was told I have hyperhydrosis. I've used lemon juice, benzoyl peroxide, a prescription baterica cream, every deodorant you can think of plus two miradry treatments and I still stink but the sweating has stopped under my arms. This is a cry for help any doctor willing to help me please reach out. I'm on the verge of suicide I try to not think about it but people at work think I don't take showers which I do every day using the products every day in the shower but the smell remains with me. I've been told I smell musty all the time. I literally tried everything and idk what to do. I've accepted the fact that the only option to stop stinking is to die. I ask myself what did I do to deserve this?

Does God forgive suicide?,"First of all, let me clarify that I am not suicidal. 
However, a few years ago my Dad took his own life. Within the last 6 months, I have given myself to God - and at first I was reluctant to do so due to the fear of accepting that my Dad would not be in Heaven due to his choice to end his life prematurely. His anniversary is approaching and I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot - does God forgive people for giving into their negative thoughts (which are the word of the devil) and ending their life? ",1b1thg3,15,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1b1thg3/does_god_forgive_suicide/,"['why would God forgive us of all sins except for the one we have no time to ask forgiveness for?

So no, I don't think suicide means your dad is in hell. Surely God would be merciful, your father must have had some kind of mental illness going on."", 'Yes. The only person who walked the earth that was sinless was Jesus. His blood covers all sins.', 'If you look at it like a Catholic he can. He probably didn‚Äôt have full consent as a mental illness or someone kinda took control of his mind/thinking', 'Just peeking at this forum I\'ve realized how much people hate that God forgives ALL sins, and not the ones that self-righteous pharisees don\'t commit or haven\'t commited yet. Sadly for them, they still have broken the whole law according to God\'s infallible Word. James 2:9-10 says: ""But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.""\n\nNo one can merit or earn salvation with their works, behaviour or repenting of sins. Repenting is changing your mind from trusting in yourself and your behaviour, works, to be saved. You\'ve already broken the entirety of God\'s law. You can only be saved by trusting in Jesus Christ alone to save you from the penalty of sin, which is hell and death. And you have eternal life the very moment you believe, so salvation cannot be lost. There\'s so many verses that make this clear and simple. John 1:12-13, John 3:14-15, John 3:16, John 3:18, John 3:36, John 5:24, John 6:28-29 (the only work of God that we must do to be saved); John 6:37, John 6:39-40 (doing the will of the Father), John 6:47, John 10:25-30, John 11:25-26, Ephesians 2:8-9, Galatians 2:16, Romans 4:5, Acts 16:30-31, 1 John 5:13, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, etc etc. If you want a larger list of verses on salvation and eternal security you can dm me.', 'There are people who survive suicide attempts and have near death experiences where they go to heaven', ""I imagine he does. But dying means you'll be entering the afterlife. So everyone who's committed suicide has probably had a stern talking to with the big man upstairs."", 'Ik i might not be around Christianity but this can likely define a reason why i have a soft spot for Christians besides growing up so close to it i dont think separation will happen anytime soon and that it will just sit in the back of my head like a cross', 'According to the Bible, there is no just reason to commit suicide. However, a truly saved person cannot lose their salvation even if they commit suicide, but it is certainly a serious sin.', 'Suicide is murder.\n\nLet me tell you that there is no purgatory to cleanse yourself after death. The spiritual work is here on our present life through spiritual awakening. There is no repentance after death. After death, the soul is already separated on whether it\'s good or bad. Good souls will be picked up by good angels and bad souls will be picked up by ugly angels. \n\nAdditionally, there is nothing written in the Bible that says other sins are forgiven after death. Luke 12:10, ""And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.""  \n\nAgain, the Bible verse talks about those people who blaspheme the Holy Spirit as not forgiven but there is nowhere in the Bible that says other sins will be forgiven after death. Obviously, the blaspheme of the Holy Spirit are the worst sin but other sins are still sins. God will still judge them for that.\n\nRevelation 22:14, ""Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.""\n\nRevelation 22:15, ""For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.""\n\nSinners are not still allowed to enter the city for the New Heaven and the New Earth!

"28m, dont know what to do","im a 28 year old male. Have had a fairly priveleged and good life so far, But I think Ive hated the majority of it, and it doesnt seem to be getting better and Idk, I dont really want to do this. I dont know if I want to quit on life or maybe Im burnt out and need a break or what.

somehow I feel Ive made a loop in my head in which I cant be satisfied with anything and atp, I just feel incapable of enjoying life. I had such ambitious, huge goals and plans, after failing at them for 5+ years now, I dont really think I can reach my gigantic goals, at least not by the time I wanted to, and I dont think I can be happy with mediocrity, which is ironic because Im probably not even at that level

people always say to change your attitude and the way you see things, but frankly Ive never been sure what that means. Not sure I can trick myself to think differently than I do? I just dont get what that means

I fear that I have some kind of personality disorder or neuro divergence that is preventing me from moving forward. there just feels like somethings missing, and even though Ive tried and tried with self medication (bad) proper medication, I tried my best with a therapist, and then tried two more. I went to my doctor practically begging them to inspect me, and frankly it was a horrible experience, and they didnt really get me any help. I may have to try it again, but what an incredible display of incompetence. Now I really dont know what to do to get help, and I dont think I can afford it anyway. Im starting to really fear bipolar disorder, given how cyclical my moods are, every 2 weeks ish, I get so demotivated and depressed, and then I become delusional and what I would think is pretty manic. Sometimes, I feel like Im prying away from reality.

then like.. if its true, and I do have one of these mental disorders, I dont want to do put up with a lifetime of dealing with it, especially not pass it on to kids. I know many people do, and maybe its cruel of me to say that Id rather go away than deal with it.. but.

Right now, I have two jobs, hate them both, Ive hated almost every job Ive had, even the ones I thought I was genuinely passionate it.
I dont make enough to support myself. Ive tried my hardest to stay consistent with my passions but I just cant. my brain feels fried now. All Ive done for the past 5-8 years is try to make a living and get out of my parents basement and I have like 6k total net worth, financially dependent on my parents. 

Ive made so many steps towards a healthier and better life, and Ive made progress, but somehow it seems my life gets emptier and shittier with every improvement. 

honestly I dont get it. It seems like everything Im supposed to do, completely goes against the grain of my existence. 

I really really fucking hate the rat race of life, and my biggest fear is being sucked into the norm. ironically, that would be healthy and its probably something Im not even strong enough to do.

I also have been to college 3 times, dropped out after a semester the first time, went to automotive school to get an associates/learn a trade, after about 2 years in the trade I started hating it and decided once again to wisely follow my passion and follow video/design. spent the last two years getting an associates, now I cant get hired because either the job market or im simply not good enough, skill wise. Plus Sora AI came out and now im questioning what the job market for creative will look like at all in 10 years. I was basically handed a shitty job in video that I do now. I just film legal depositions. its incredibly unchallenging yet stresssful, and boring. Im not ungrateful for the opportunity and the trust that my instructor has given me, but this isnt what I want to do, or objectively a good gig

Ive thought about this alot, but I think its possible that 80-90% of the time Ive felt joy in my entire life has been from drugs, sex, videogames or any of these other powerful doses of dopamine. 

But today, and the past few weeks, I have really really fallen into a dark place. All I can think about is just taking a giant risk or dying. I just dont want to do this anymore. I dont want a career, I dont want to work, I dont want to better myself anymore, I dont want to self diagnose and try to figure out why Im not more productive, I dont want to learn new corporate bullshit lingo, I dont want to pretend to give a shit, I dont want to manifest. I dont want skills or to prove my worth in the marketplace and compete. I dont want to network.

I really dont know what to do, because I dont think I even really care to pull myself out of this rut. Ive cried for help, like 50 times in the past few years. nobody can help you. Everyone I care about most in my life is just annoyed with me at this point, and dont want to tolerate me. All I can get is generic advice Ive heard 1,000 times. get a career, something meaningful that supports your life, get exercise, eat healthy, get enough sleep, get relationships.

 The worst part is my life is my responsibility, I realized too late and squandered it all. 

my upbringing was too comfortable, my dreams were too lofty, and now I cant bear to be myself in this world. its my fault and it makes me hate myself so much

Ive spent all of my free time in the past 5 years trying to become a youtuber, this childish pathetic fucking goal. Ive worked for like 60+ hours every week at a job I dont like, and building things on the side. researching businesses, various side hustles. paid for social media marketing courses, masterclass, hundreds of youtube videos. Ive made probanly over 400 videos now and cant even get work as a professional while some dipshit records themselves with a $10 lavalier and can get paid

even as an auto tech. I fucking swapped my engine and transmission, spent literally every hour of my days working on cars for years, and never even managed to make a liveable wage? I leveraged new employment and dedicated more than god damn anyone I worked with to that craft. 17$ an hour.

how can I be so incompetent that I spend all of my free time trying to become financially independent and I get nowhere fucking close

but of course, ""ThaTs JuSt How LiFe iS!""
cool, dont like it, dont want to do it then

I feel like my brain is completely broken. I wont even listen to people because Im fucking delusional

All Ive thought about lately is just saving up like 5k at some shit dead end job, buying a van and just bumming around until I die. 

it continues to be true that the only two things standing between me and death are my parents and the slight fear I have of the afterlife, and how suicide might affect it

I had a near death experience when I was 21, and was blessed with an incredible gratitude, drive and optimism, and it seems like despite my efforts, I have squandered it just 7 years later

I dont even know where to begin on how to become a healthy, well adjusted adult and frankly Idk.

I just envy people who can tolerate life so much

Is college my only option to be happy?,"I (18F) feel so lost in what direction I want my life to go. I just want to escape my abusive family and be happy.  
  
I was one of the most hardworking, overachieving, active students in high school. I was in the Top 10% of my class, I took APs, I worked, I was the leader of multiple clubs, and I took an active role in advocating for my school district. After working hard for so long, it became worth it when I got into a very competitive, highly ranked school with great financial aid. I didn't even have to maintain a certain GPA, just pass my classes, get a degree, and get into a good job afterwards.  
  
I majored in Electrical Engineering because of the high demand and great pay, and I was interested in working with circuit boards and building things. I worked so hard for all of this because I thought that's was I was going to be, independent at this far away school where I could get away from my abusive (emotionally and physically) family. Everyone would always tell me what a great opportunity it was, and it did start out great.  
  
I was making friends, I joined clubs, I went out often, and I was attending my classes. Everything on the outside seemed great, but I ended up taking a leave of absence after a suicide attempt in the first semester. I felt so overworked and burnt out, I couldn't pay attention in my classes, I didn't have the energy to do any work, and the course load was overwhelming. I tried everything to improve my situation. I was working with my academic advisor, I kept in frequent contact with my professors, I went to office hours, I went to tutoring, and I was in therapy through the university, but nothing got better. I even tried taking less classes, switching classes around, and switched majors a couple times. Eventually, I just ended up taking a leave of absence after my suicide attempt.  
  
After I left, I ended up in a psych ward for 2 weeks, and was in a partial care program after for about a week. Even though my mood definitely stabilized after that time, I still was struggling trying to figure out what to do. While I was there, I tried talking to a bunch of different adults I met, but they really only said things like ""you're young, you have time to figure things out don't worry about it"".  
  
Since then, I've been working back at my high school job at home, and fell into another depressive episode in December. I just feel so lost and aimless, and I've been fighting with my family because they want me to go back to college. I ended up attempting again in January, and ended up at another psych ward for about a week. I'm now in a different therapy program as well as having regular appointments with my primary therapist (I've had her for around 4 years now).  
  
I just had another appointment yesterday, and my therapist wants me to go back to school as well. I genuinely don't think I can tolerate being in that environment again, but I'm scared about what else I can do with my life. More than anything, I want to get out of this house and maybe move into an apartment with my gf (18f) by the end of this year or early next year. Honestly though, I'm scared that might be unrealistic given the state of the economy. For now, I've just been applying to other jobs and thinking about getting into investment.

going too far ,"i‚Äôm not sure if this is even depression anymore, or something else, but i have dealt with depression since i was young, i had my first suicidal thought at 9 years old. before i even knew what that meant. my whole life ive spent feeling consistently sad, all of the time, nothing else. i‚Äôm 20 now, and the past couple months have gotten worse. i don‚Äôt feel anything anymore. i don‚Äôt feel happiness, excitement, sadness, guilt, pleasure, empathy. i don‚Äôt love or even like anyone. all i feel is contempt and annoyance. i dread seeing my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, i dread talking to people, even hobbies i once found pleasure in have become more of an annoyance.

i don‚Äôt care about anyone or anything they might go through or say, my entire time spent awake is pretending to care what people say and carefully choosing my responses. i keep people around me as they will be useful in my future, but i would much prefer to spend my life completely alone. 

i have found myself thinking bad thoughts about people, strangers and loved ones, which i never would have thought of months ago. intrusive thoughts, that i just can‚Äôt seem to shake. i find myself wanting to hurt my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and family, emotionally, and i do not know why. 

i feel like a shell of a person, just someone who other people can project onto and create a version of me they would prefer, and i cater to it. because i am not a person, so i change who i am around different people. i be who they want me to be and it serves me. 

i‚Äôve lost dozens of friends in my life, i grow close to them and cut them off suddenly with no warning. i do this everytime. in the past month ive cut off one of my closest friends and i do not feel anything. they are quite upset and ruined by this but i just do not care.

Releasing a patch every week and causing more bugs to surface only drives me and other players away. Unlike the avengers game it was on top of the bugs mostly and actually could run a server until they were shut down obviously. But I really enjoyed the hell out of this and they to get a grip and release a whole update were it fixes the main things we complain about. Sending emails and bug reports just to get the same email from a generated email account is absolutely ridiculous. Us gamers who have spent money time and effort just to have a buggy non playable game is bs.

Is it bad that I feel guilty for not being able to love my parents?,"I, 21F, am struggling with some personal issues right now (depression, drinking) while living at home. I am still working but at home I usually (and have basically always) spent most of my time in my room‚Äîsomething my mom has always nitpicked me for.

I‚Äôve never felt comfortable around my parents and have never really felt like I ‚Äúloved‚Äù them. Fairly recently I went out with them to eat which I haven‚Äôt done in a while, which I thought made them happy. And I felt pretty proud of myself when I actually had the energy/motivation to make my bed/shower/ and clean the bathrooms as my mom told me to do days ago (‚Äúbecause, you know, I don‚Äôt make you pay rent‚Äù). I‚Äôve been putting off a lot of things lately including a lot of schoolwork and even basic hygienic things. So I felt kinda proud about that.

But today my dad tells me he wants to talk to me after I come out of the shower. I thought he was just gonna tell me to like fill the fridge with pop or something but instead he‚Äôs like ‚Äúme and your mother are concerned about you, you never smile anymore. Are you drinking again?‚Äù And that was really strange because this guys never the one to initiate that stuff, he just lays on the couch all day and dry heaves and screams at our dogs. It just ticked me off because I knew deep down they didn‚Äôt really care, they just want to know if I‚Äôm drinking so they another thing to yell at me for. And I never liked being around them, because it‚Äôs not enjoyable. I always have felt like a disappointment and a burden around them, so why would I want to put myself in that situation? I just wanted to get off the couch and leave as soon as possible. 

But I thought about it and I know I struggle with feeling guilt and shame about a lot of things, but I hate that I‚Äôve never been able to say I genuinely love them, because I don‚Äôt. And I hate that they act so concerned because I feel like it‚Äôs just fake and surface level. I would never talk to them about any of these things because it would make me feel too vulnerable and weak and I probably just couldn‚Äôt do it anyway because they are the root of why I have such bad core beliefs about myself (feelings of worthlessness, looming sense of doom, suicidal ideation, I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy, I‚Äôm not going to have a future).

Sample Farming Runs,I feel like this sub could benefit from a flair or a sister sub that is all about finding groups to do sample farming runs with.

An Honest Discussion ,"Solo's in Battle Royal is already a difficult mode to play successfully on due to EOMM.(Engagement Optimized Matchmaking) not actually balancing the game mode and deliberately making your opponents better than you in order to stretch playtime but there are two common problems this Season that completely eliminate the verdict of skill and often give the player with them a free win.
Those being the current TMNT weapons and most egregiously the insanely overpowered NPC's added this season that allow solo players to essentially team.
Firstly I will admit that the TMNT weapons were fun to try out and use for about 3 times.
At first air jumping/dashing around and hitting successful hits is fun until you realize the inconsistency of the weapon at close distances and how difficult it is to micro-adjust your dashes without a keyboard and mouse.
However If you have a true hold over to your movement then you will become unstoppable in a way the other player could never manage.
Close range attacks from the weapons are near impossible to react to due to limited aim and 
Cursor movement when they are that absurdly close to you.
The joy of having these weapons also soon ends when you realize just about all of the weapons do functionally the same thing and all kills with them are guaranteed under previously mentioned circumstances.

Secondly is the god awful NPC'S added to the game.
For the simple and easily obtainable price of just 500 you can pay for a teammate with rediculous aim,boosts such as free and easy heals,enemy pinging, and suicide bombing your opponents with cluster clingers.
I've seen so many cases of these where not one person past the last 8 is utilizing an NPC and camping until the NPC does the work for them.
It doesn't help that 45% of NPC's are hirable and easily obtainable.
The NPC's also literally never die ever.
I've never killed one without killing who hired them and  I can't even remember if I've ever broken ones shield.
It's literally to closest to teaming in solos as possible and is actively worse in many ways due to free items.
But that concludes my rant..",1b1t943,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1b1t943/an_honest_discussion/,"['Everyone has access to the same weapons and everyone can go hire an NPC.

Everybody goes away in the end,"Hey idk where else to go but this has been weighing on me heavily for awhile now.  

Several years ago, I moved away from a town I'd lived in for almost 10 years. I never let myself make any close friends there at first bc I always saw the move as temporary. Well, I got comfortable and made a friend. We started hanging out and got fairly close, going to the gym a few times a week and just hanging out. Maybe two years pass and my spouse gets a job out of state and we move. I keep up with my friend. We text and chat daily. Send each other stuff. I visit them. We send video chats. They go through a hard time with their spouse. I support them. They have fertility issues. I give advice. They eventually have a baby. I'm so happy for my friend.

Well, the baby is born and they hire a babysitter. Become good friends with the babysitter. All they talk about anymore is the babysitter. They quit their job. Become a stay at home parent. Hang out with their new friend several times a week. Communication goes dry. I'm so sad. I miss my friend. I feel ditched and I'm a full grown adult. I work full time so it's hard to make friends outside of work IRL. Idk what to do. My depression has been really bad, work has been awful, and I've been having thoughts of suicide ideation. I'm so damn lonely. I have my spouse and my kids, thank goodness. They're the only good parts of my life anymore. 

I'm sorry for the pity party. I just needed to get that out. ",1b1t8r7,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1b1t8r7/everybody_goes_away_in_the_end/,[]
Confidentiality: Non Suicidal Self-harm in Adolescents ,"Hi. I‚Äôm talking with a colleague tomorrow but anxiety is eating me, so here we are. 

My client engaged in self-harm. Not major, but not insignificant. Multiple shallow cuts. 

In my previous work in CMH I was urged to always inform the parent if a client engaged in self-harm. But is that always the case?

I assessed risk. The client committed to safety and stated the self-harm was more about relief than wanting to die. 
They are VERY averse to telling/involving the parent. Therapy is one of their only spaces they feel they can be honest about SI and self-harm. 

Should I involve the parent? :s

I want to be collaborative/ empowering/ respect the client‚Äôs wishes, but I also want to make sure they are safe (and, of course, CYA.)

I also want to know if my own anxiety is getting the best of me. 

I am an early career therapist in MI, if that is relevant. 

Thank you in advance!

Other times we make a plan to tell them eventually if they‚Äôve refrained for some time (and I‚Äôm just now finding out for whatever reason). I‚Äôm upfront with my teens from the beginning that they‚Äôll almost always know I‚Äôm telling their guardian something before I do.\n\nEdit - I also explain to teen clients that discussing suicide and self harm doesn‚Äôt scare me so it will be a normal conversation and not me immediately trying to hospitalize them.

For instance, cutting has the risk of being unintentionally fatal and even if it's not, depending on the cut, it could get infected if untreated. However, part of our informed consent up front with the clients is that we'll have to inform the parents if they disclose SH. So they are aware before they tell us. Personally, I don't like it. Clients have a right to privacy, and I think the fact that we'll disclose to parents may actually prevent clients for being honest with therapists. It's amazing how many clients are referred to me for SH but haven't harmed at all since they've been seeing me. I ain't that good.""]"
‚ÄúWatch out - it‚Äôs the suicide pasty bomber!‚Äù - Anti Cornish Republican Army Cartoon - 2017,"The Cornish Republican Army (also known as the ‚ÄòCornish National Liberation Army‚Äô) was a short lived militant Cornish nationalist group focused on the independence of the Celtic county of Cornwall within England between 2007 and 2017 

context:
the cartoon here depicts a campaign set about by the group in 2017 whereby they attacked Stein‚Äôs, Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsey owned restaurants in Cornwall with fire bombs (as seen with the two frightened chefs in the cartoon) as well as tearing St George and Union Jack flags displayed in people‚Äôs gardens to send awareness about and to actively fight culturally English presence in the region. 
Cornwall is most well known in England for the Cornish pasty, a pastry that is the shape as in the cartoon, with the outer layer being belike that of a sausage roll‚Äôs pastry layer or a croissant, often filled with a steak, chicken or macaroni filling, which is the reason for its use here as a way to stereotype the Cornish militant woman. 
The ‚ÄúKernow Lives Matter‚Äù sign is a pun on the ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù slogan, with the term ‚ÄòKernow‚Äô being the Cornish language term for Cornwall and is used often by Cornish nationalists even when speaking English

How to stop? Desperate,This is the most intense FP I‚Äôve had in a while and it‚Äôs worst and kind of new to me. Other FPs I‚Äôve had were like my female teachers who paid attention to me or were kind to me.

It‚Äôs like a drug having FP and u just crave it but with teachers I could only get so much so I wasn‚Äôt as obsessed.

I just want a friend.,"Honestly, idrk why I‚Äôm even posting here, or why I‚Äôm on my main, but I‚Äôm honestly about to give up hope. I‚Äôve been dealing with depression for a few years. A couple months back it started getting a lot better. I finally started getting a into a good routine, instead of sitting around on my computer and not even being able to get the energy or motivation to shower or eat, I started working out for an hour a day, practicing guitar for an hour a day, I was going to bed at a decent time, I applied to the military and had my aptitude test and medical exam. 

And then it all came crashing down.


Basically, ants. They invaded my room. To the point where I moved to a room upstairs. They were the the final straw that broke the camels back. I sprayed some stuff and they disappeared for two weeks. But now they have appeared again in the room opposite where they were originally. And when I saw them again today, I genuinely thought about ending it, and that scares me. To add a little; I‚Äôve tried to kms once before, I‚Äôm high school, I was in a bad spout with drugs but I got through it. This feels different. I truly am so pissed off that this is what is setting me over the edge. But I‚Äôm about to give up, I have no one to talk to when I feel like this. I have no one to reach out to, to feel comfortable with. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

There‚Äôs a shit ton of stuff that I think is contributing to my depression and suicidal thoughts, but I‚Äôm not gonna list every single thing, however just for an example of some of the feelings I‚Äôm going through;

I don‚Äôt have any irl friends, well I have one, I suppose, but we don‚Äôt communicate enough and he lives about 2 ish hours away so it‚Äôs not easy to hang out. But yeah all of my friends are online, and it‚Äôs a small group of us, maybe 7 or 8 at most. But the issue is, I do not feel comfortable enough with them to share these thoughts and feelings. I love them, but I just can‚Äôt expose myself to them that way.

There was a girl who I had been friends with for about two years, and we started getting really close, and I fell hard for her. To the point where I genuinly still feel now, over a year later, the same way I did when I first had feelings for her.
Things didn‚Äôt work out, and we drifted apart, and it‚Äôs been over a year, close to 2 now, and it‚Äôs killing me. I tried reaching out, but no avail. 

Im so lost, As I mentioned I tried to end my life once, but this is worse. I feel so much more scared now, I think it‚Äôs because I have no one there for me.I truly don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this, or at least, what I hope to achieve in posting this. But anyways, thanks for listening I guess.

Today I met someone extremely homophobic and I didn‚Äôt know what to say?,"I was at college and had a talk with someone I just met about general stuff and then somehow the conversation turned into a gays vs heterosexuals debate and I couldn‚Äôt make a counter argument even though he made no sense, the convo went as following:

Him: I am not really a supporter of lgbt, I actually consider myself anti-gay.

Me: What do you mean?

Him: I don‚Äôt think we should really support gays, I think it is a mental illness and bad for the community.

Me: I think that is very homophobic and inconsiderate 

Him: Why would you think so, I have proof it is a mental illness

Me: And what is that?

Him: Would you consider someone suicidal mentally ill?

Me: Yes but what does that have to do with anything?

Him: (ignores my question) Why would you consider him mentally ill?

Me: well he wants to kill himself

Him: And what is wrong with that?

Me: where are you trying to go with this?

Him: Okay hear me out, a suicidal person is considered mentally ill because killing yourself means that you lost your survival instinct which is a human default that preserved the human race, similarly losing interest in the opposite sex and not having the urge to procreate with them is a human default that if you lack makes you mentally ill.

Me: This makes no sense people are born gay

Him: No one is born gay, everyone is by default heterosexual, gays are just people affected by external factors that made them gay wether it was child abuse or porn addiction or whatever 

Me: That is not enough proof it is a mental illness

Him: I believe it is, you will also notice that in many cases a certain mental illness like social anxiety could cause other mental illnesses like depression, people who are gay are almost all suffer from other mental illnesses.

Me: This doesn‚Äôt sound right, I have a lecture I got to go.

i feel numb (14f),"just need to rant, honestly. sorry if it‚Äôs long.

there is nothing in my life going on right now that should make me feel how i do and i hate myself for it. there are so many people in worse situations than me. i have good grades, good home life etc.

but i just feel numb. i don‚Äôt even know if sad is the right word anymore. a few nights ago i relapsed self harming (2 years) and i liked it. ive been doing it more and i can‚Äôt bring myself to feel any guilt whatsoever about it. i also don‚Äôt want to stop. i can‚Äôt bring myself to cry, i want to so badly; but everything just feels stuck.

i like my friends and i want what‚Äôs best for them. they think im funny so i go to school and i want to see them smile and laugh, because they deserve it. then i get home and don‚Äôt know what to do, so ill get into bed at 8 but not sleep until the crack of dawn. i don‚Äôt even feel anxious or anything, i just lie there awake because my body doesn‚Äôt want to sleep.

ive tried reflecting on myself, and i don‚Äôt think i even really know who i am anymore. i don‚Äôt know my favourite colour. i couldn‚Äôt tell you my favourite food or movie, or my dislikes. i do not know. im not sure when i stopped knowing.

i don‚Äôt know what to do. life feels so wrong, i just wake up everyday and wait for it to be night again. i go to school to see my friends smile. i can‚Äôt think of anything else. i used to finish a book in 3 days, haven‚Äôt picked one up in weeks. i don‚Äôt want to watch a show, i don‚Äôt want to talk to anybody. i don‚Äôt want to do anything. 

i have a history with mental health, but i can‚Äôt remember those times much. i remember getting sent to a hospital when i was 9 for suicidal thoughts, but those memories don‚Äôt feel as real as now. this feels very different. i promised myself i would never be suicidal again because i saw how sad it made everyone around me, and im not suicidal now. sometimes, though, i wonder what would happened if i did die. i don‚Äôt want to kill myself but i can‚Äôt imagine myself in the future. it‚Äôs weird.

#  Part XV: We're Stellaron Hunters!

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind getting some payback on them‚Ä¶ DDoSing the station again would be pretty funny. Sounds fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúDDoSing?‚Äù Blade narrows his eyes at Silver Wolf‚Äôs jargon.

‚ÄúYou know you have a phone that you can look things up with, right?‚Äù

Blade pulls his phone out and just stares at it. ‚ÄúHow do I do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way you don‚Äôt know how to‚Äì You know what? There‚Äôs a perfect feature for people like you. Just hold down the power button, say ‚ÄòOkay, phone,‚Äô and ask a question.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/z8gj7rab68lc1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81582c72ce0db7ea811f8fdeb17efd647d4370c1

‚ÄúOkay, phone.‚Äù Blade squints at the device in his hand. ‚ÄúWhat does ‚ÄòDDoSing mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúDefinition: ‚ÄòDDoS,‚Äô a cybercrime in which the attacker shuts down a service, system, or server by flooding it with artificial digital traffic.‚Äù

I look between the two and their surreal interaction. So this is their relationship now‚Ä¶ I clear my throat and try to steer the conversation back onto topic. ‚ÄúSo, um, Silver Wolf‚Ä¶ Do you think you could get us on Herta Space Station then?‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/lff6da0d68lc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4148ce92c201b658d3a437b0dc62127095fa6b1a

She raises an eyebrow at me. ‚ÄúYou both want to come along?‚Äù

I exchange glances with Blade. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶ Well, if it was just myself, I would‚Äôve tried a stealth approach, but‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt really smuggle you two in like that.‚Äù Silver Wolf furrows her eyebrows, staring down at the ground for a while before finally blinking. Another smirk creeps onto her face. ‚ÄúAlthough, if both of you are coming, there‚Äôs no need for stealth. We can just show up, and what are they gonna do? Fight you both?‚Äù

Blade and I exchange another look, a little more concern this time before turning back to Silver Wolf. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we want to make worse enemies of the Genius Socie‚Äì‚Äù

She begins laughing. ‚ÄúYou two could probably just destroy the entire space station in an instant if you wanted! We can just barge in there and take what we want!‚Äù

I try my best to hide my grimace as Blade simply glares at Silver Wolf. ‚ÄúS-Silver Wolf?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut wait‚Ä¶ Would it still be fun that way‚Ä¶?‚Äù Silver Wolf places a hand on her chin and narrows her eyes in contemplation once more. ‚ÄúHow do we give them a fair chance to win‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúJust get us onto the damn space station.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay! Okay‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll approach this with the ‚Äòbig stick diplomacy‚Äô method. You two are the big sticks, and I‚Äôll do the talking.‚Äù

‚ÄúSilver Wolf, respectfully, you‚Äôre not good at talking.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I have to agree with Blade here‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm great at talking!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between being good at talking and talking too much. Kafka‚Äôs good at it. You won‚Äôt shut up.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/81xvwdye68lc1.jpg?width=812&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aca9d2bae1800ecba9a625b89aa6dcc98e288913

‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù I think they‚Äôre starting to give me a headache‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSilver Wolf, when do you think you can get us in?‚Äù

‚ÄúMmn‚Ä¶ We should be ready to go tomorrow morning. I‚Äôll just need to double check some beacons.‚Äù

I let out a sigh and begin making preparations to recalibrate Sam to his shaper. Why do I already feel exhausted‚Ä¶? I‚Äôll have to go sleep this off in my pod later‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs right. A good night‚Äôs rest and sweet dreams before a day out with Silver Wolf, even if it‚Äôs, uh‚Ä¶ robbing a space station for equipment? It‚Äôs not really stealing if it‚Äôs stealing from IPC funds, right?

In the morning, Silver Wolf gathers us together and opens a quantum rift in space directly onto the space station, and upon stepping into the Master Control Zone, we turn a corner to immediately find a girl with ball joints glaring up at us. ‚ÄúWhat the hell do you lunatics want? You couldn‚Äôt have shown up at a worse time!‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/jxlnjx1h68lc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=892b66a7fa957f1f67ce33fa3b4dc88965caea69

Silver Wolf chuckles with a smug grin. ‚ÄúAw, what‚Äôs wrong, Herta? I did give you a heads-up that we were coming. Be a little more hospitable to guests, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúA heads up!? Yeah, by brute forcing your way past the firewalls! You tipped off every alarm possible! I don't have the time to play these little games with you right now, Silver Wolf.‚Äù The puppet girl places her hands on her hips as her eyes narrow with indignation. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a gathering of geniuses in less than 24 system hours for a Simulated Universe update, and I‚Äôve got one hell of a situation on my hands! Now either tell me what you lot are here for or get the hell out!‚Äù

I step forward, wanting to be as efficient and direct about it as possible. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be taking some equipment from the station.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/5808lbrj68lc1.jpg?width=1190&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=344f383b27d51edde780785fb572de64e6cafdd7

Despite Sam towering over her, Herta simply glares back up towards me with unimpressed contempt and no sign of fear. ‚ÄúOkay? Go.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, you‚Äôre just gonna give it to us?‚Äù Silver Wolf steps forward and takes a stance next to me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no fun!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt have time for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Stellaron Hunters! We don‚Äôt take handouts!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe get a monthly stipend from Elio.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs different, Blade!‚Äù Silver Wolf turns back to Herta after protesting Blade‚Äôs unnecessary exposition. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs gotten you so worked up today?‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/4ownsp9l68lc1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ede9b3371514f18837748c8f900005631633a0cf

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs gotten me so worked up?!‚Äù The doll‚Äôs eyelids widen so much that it seems as though her eyes are going to fall out of their sockets. ‚ÄúHa! I‚Äôve got a workplace suicide on my hands that I‚Äôve got to clean up before my peers arrive for an important meeting, and then some of the most wanted terrorists show up onto my space station! What‚Ä¶ do you think has me so worked up!?‚Äù

A cold silence dawns upon the atmosphere. I slowly turn toward Blade and Silver Wolf to gauge their reactions to the situation we‚Äôve walked into. Although Blade continues wearing his usual, stoic expression, there seems to be a hint of solemn respect while Silver Wolf purses her lips in regret.

She takes a deep breath and finally breaks the tension. ‚ÄúAwkward‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSilver Wolf!‚Äù I fully turn to her, wishing my glare could be seen through my helmet. ‚ÄúYou did not just drop a cheesy gag-movie one-liner to that news!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù She shrugs. ‚ÄúI held back from saying something way more inappropriate!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat could you have said that was more inappropriate than that?!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis.‚Äù She strides directly up to Herta. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna lie, Herta, if I had to work for you, I‚Äôd probably kill myself too.‚Äù

‚ÄúSILVER WOLF!‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/1b7blpfr68lc1.jpg?width=849&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01445f38b9add09215ab2133606b52be386a9404

‚ÄúHey, you asked!‚Äù

Blade clears his throat. ‚ÄúSilver Wolf, what‚Äôs that word you used to express sympathy?‚Äù

‚ÄúMood?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, mood. Committing suicide‚Ä¶.‚Äù Blade crosses his arms and closes his eyes, taking his usual stoic pose. ‚ÄúI mood with that.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/iq89hf7u68lc1.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c575f95142bd1c2ffc02218ad474742ac47547b

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not using it right.‚Äù Silver Wolf stares blankly at Blade before turning back to me. ‚ÄúLook, I get it. Tragic someone took their own life. But you act like we‚Äôre not going to rob them anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúY-Yeah, I mean, yes, we‚Äôre still going to rob them, but at least be respectful!‚Äù

‚ÄúSam, we‚Äôre interastrally wanted criminals. You‚Äôve never been worked up like this over all the other atrocities we‚Äôve committed.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust because the IPC labels us as criminals doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre monsters!‚Äù

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot now, Blade.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam, just how many IPC wagecucks have you incinerated at this point?‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/qktp97yv68lc1.jpg?width=849&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1501686a0e8fbe306ecc30e2cbd9681cff31a01b

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a ‚Äòwagecuck?‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I know we kill people, but we can still give our condolences when a tragedy strikes! Suicide should not be taken lightly!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a ‚Äòwagecuck?‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúCooking someone alive shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly either, but that‚Äôs just a Tuesday for you, isn‚Äôt it? How many people do you think died when we incited the Jepella Rebellion?‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/e0ksf6qy68lc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b85318a5c8e6ea962570bc44f6b2cb849ef6b35d

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs beside the point! Missions are missions! It can‚Äôt be helped!‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, phone. What‚Äôs a ‚Äòwagecuck?‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt quite catch that. Could you repeat the question?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, I get it. It was insensitive of me. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôll pretend we care.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, phone‚Ä¶ What‚Ä¶ is a ‚Äòwagecuck?‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúBlade, stop asking what a ‚Äòwagecuck‚Äô is.‚Äù

‚ÄúDefinition: ‚ÄòWagecuck,‚Äô originating from internet forums. A term used to describe people living paycheck to paycheck with the connotation that they are being taken advantage of by the large corporations that employ them. It is a portmanteau of the words ‚Äòwage,‚Äô referring to a salary and ‚Äòcuck,‚Äô meaning‚Äì‚Äù

I snag Blade‚Äôs phone out of his hand and turn it off before turning to Herta again. ‚ÄúListen, we‚Äôre sorry for your loss, but we‚Äôll be taking what we need and leaving.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes receiving a monthly stipend make us wagecucks?‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/y0lkd7t178lc1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ad185d26691001f1ee40f9b84779ec92360c636

‚ÄúSilver Wolf, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this and not the other way around, but you‚Äôre a terrible influence on Blade. Can we please just‚Ä¶‚Äù I sigh with frustration and turn back to Herta. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre better than this, I swear. We care about people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must agree with Sam. Matters of life and death are sacred and must be treated with utmost respect. We don‚Äôt want to kill people. Unless destiny demands that we do, in which case, we kill indiscriminately. Without a second thought. It‚Äôs a necessary sacrifice for the greater good.‚Äù Blade smiles at me with pride. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve seen Sam back on Jepella. Unlike me, he doesn‚Äôt just send people to hell; he brings it to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúBlade, you‚Äôre not helping.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo need to be modest, Sam. You‚Äôre very efficient at killing.‚Äù

‚ÄúHumility isn‚Äôt the problem here!‚Äù

I‚Äôve been like this for the past 7-8 years and for the most part it was just an underlying desire I would indulge in if I was feeling stressed, apart from a few long and particularly bad periods surrounding painful family/life events. I used to fantasize about what my life would look like if I could just keep pushing through it, but every time I think I see a life raft and try to cling to it it evaporates and I sink deeper

I‚Äôve been trying to keep up appearances with the friends and family I still have, but I don‚Äôt have the energy or ability to maintain my facade and I‚Äôm starting to alienate them.

No more birth control options left. Help! ,"Hi! F21, 57kg, 5‚Äô4, Australia

I was on the combination birth control pill (skipping the sugar pills) since I was 15 to stop my painful periods and PMDD symptoms. In september 2023 I had a migraine with an aura which is when my GP took me off the pill for stroke concerns.

When my periods came back they were excruciating, extremely heavy and leading up to the periods I was suicidal/depressed and was having to take emergency contraception too often. Which is when I decided to go back on a birth control.

When my GP explained all my progesterone only options, the depo provera shot sounded like the only one that was guaranteed to stop my periods. I got this done in early december 2023

i‚Äôm now about to get my second shot of the depo, but the side effects are horrible, i have cystic acne all over my chin, jawline and neck and i am experiencing fluctuations in mood quite often along with spotting. 

I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs anything else out there that will not only most likely stop my periods but also stop me from getting pregnant, it sounds like the depo is my last option.  

Medical History

Black History Month Day 27 Amethyst Kiah,"Bum bum bum. Final countdown.

Today we are going to have a talk about the Queer folk artist Amethyst Kiah, one of the members of  Our Native Daughters.(notice a trend? ü§´)

Amethyst Kiah was born in 1986 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Her father was a percussionist for a band and her mother sang for the church. Being exposed to Eastern Tennessee‚Äôs folk culture, Kiah taught herself guitar and banjo while she studied at an arts school.

Unfortunately for Kiah her first public performance was quite unfortunate. Kiahs mother committed suicide when she was 17, leaving Kiah to host her first performance at her mother's funeral. Later in her years she wrote ‚ÄúWild Turkey‚Äù with her story of overcoming the pains from her loss.

Kiah kept playing music, eventually enrolling in East Tennessee State University in which she studied in a Bluegrass, Old-time and Country music program. Eventually joining the schools marquee old-time band.

Kiah has been touring with her band, Her Chest of Glass since 2010. Though occasionally performs with other members of ‚ÄúOur Native Daughters‚Äù.

One of her compositions for the group, ‚ÄúBlack Myself‚Äù went on to be awarded for the 2020 Grammy Award Best American Roots Song nomination. 

Kiah‚Äôs music touches across many genres, rock, country, old-time, bluegrass. But she herself identifies her music as ‚ÄúSouthern Gothic‚Äù which is quite different from many artists we‚Äôve talked about.

Kiah without a doubt has a very unique but powerful voice that brings a lot of emotions and soul into her music. I wish I had half her talent hahaha.

Anywho here's her playing her rendition of Darling Cora

"Made a terrible decision, I see no way out but to kill myself and I desperately need help","Hello,

I have never been suicidal before and I've always cherished life and thought that I would never ever think of killing myself, I love life and I strive for improving my situation no matter what is going on. But this all changed and I've hit the lowest point of my life ever.

I'm 27, a software engineer and I've done well in life and some level of success (despite some traumatic events in my upbringing) and I navigated my world with resilience and hard work even though I've had some level of anxiety from time to time (let's say in the form of mild episodes but infrequent), I graduated and landed a great job and worked really hard, got promoted and few raises, I was also living on my own in a nice place, life was GREAT. Unfortunately I have also made bad decisions such as smoking weed heavily and participating in building a startup on the side with some people which left me really overworked. 

All that has been ongoing for 2 years, until the day I had a panic attack out of nowhere. That shattered my world and I have gone from someone who's active, energetic, charismatic and overflowing with confidence to a shell of a person, I have suffered from periods of depersonalization/derealization and life was a living hell. I have gone to a psychiatrist of course and I followed up with the treatment and started taking anti-depressants for 6 months until I could get a little better. It was hell but I pushed through it and kept my job luckily because the workload was really low for me at that time.

About a year after that panic attack, I was much better but not entirely healed, I have started gaining my confidence back. But I made a TERRIBLE mistake, the worst mistake of my life, I had an opportunity to take a job at a prestigious company with a big raise (53%) but with much more stress and insane workload, I have been hesitant about it but I took it and left my comfortable job, mind you at my comfortable job I was well respected for my great contributions and had many privileges of remote work and flexible hours and low workload. At the new job it was HELL, insane workload, very long hours (9am - 9pm) and work was very tight deadlines. I lasted 3 months there before I crashed down and quit, I have sustained a lot of damage from that and my anxiety went over the roof and I just couldn't keep going.

Now I'm back to living with my parents just recovering from all that (I've only quit like a month ago) and the regret of changing jobs is killing me, I feel like I ruined my life with that decision, I feel like I didn't prioritize my mental health and got greedy and thought I could just make it work.

I'm battling with suicidal thoughts every day and I'm sinking lower and lower and I've become very serious about it to the point of planning exactly how I would do it and I feel like that's where I'm headed.

Any help would be really appreciated",1b1sl99,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1b1sl99/made_a_terrible_decision_i_see_no_way_out_but_to/,['It sounds as if you are truly in a crisis of confidence.

I have no reason to go on living,"This is probably the first and last post I will ever make on reddit. I am still in late middle school but I have no reason to continue living my life. I‚Äôm planning to jump off a bridge about 20 minutes from me on April 7th. I was a bad person when I was younger, my friends and I would bully kids regularly. When we were interviewed about the things going on with us, all of my friends blamed me for what we all collectively did. Now, years later, in late middle school, it still haunts me. I was outcasted for the things we all did and I lost all my friends. I walk the halls of my school knowing that everyone thinks I‚Äôm a complete asshole to everyone I know, even though I‚Äôve changed as a person. I walk with my head down and I struggle to interact with anyone because I developed severe social anxiety after being shut out by all of the people I cared about. I live to go to school, which I‚Äôm already getting progressively shittier grades in. I have no friends and nobody to open up to. I am going to kill myself. Edit: I am 13 and have been stopping suicides and bad mental health since I was 10 years old. I never received any help in return.

Exactly how far does anonymity go?,"I've been sober for almost 3 years now. I believe that this question is not from a newcomer.

I believe that there are probably not any enforceable¬†laws about this (nor easy answers), but does AA govern itself the same as HIPPA laws regarding therapists or other mental health professionals that must report the likelihood of harming self and/or others? At what point is it proper to break the anonymity¬†of someone who shared something as horrible as wanting to murder her family or commit suicide or both? A harm to him/herself and/or others? Is there a hard line, should we adopt HIPPA standards, or is it fuzzy like shades of grey? Is the answer dependent upon Tradition Four?

My personal belief is that we know when a line is crossed, and the authorities need to be involved. Having said that, please answer all of the above. Should there be a standard of determining when to call the authorities on a fellow AA? No. I believe that Tradition Four is prophetic. Each of us in our own communities can respect Tradition Three (meaning little-to-no racism and such nonsense), but we all know when somebody's diddling a kid, and stop the guy.

Girl likes me way too much.,"Okay, im not a Redditor and I do not visit this page daily, I just needed someone who had similiar experience to help me out a little bit.  
I've met this girl couple of nights ago on a night out, we talked to each other and we were both kinda drunk (not wasted but yk).   
I am not looking for a relationship and she seems way too nice to have a one night stand with her. I do not wanna hurt her doing that.  Also we exchanged IG's and she DMed me next day. Since then she litteraly wont stop texting and she is responding to me like 2 seconds after my message. I am not even the one pushing the convo forward but she is the one doing it, plus she tries really hard to flirt.   
Im responding slowly because Im thinking that way she will lose interest but she legit keeps coming back. I've learned that she had a hard childhood and wants love but I cannot provide it to her and she is trying really so hard to push this as much as she can.  
So to sumarize if I understand this correctly : **girl needs love really bad, I feel bad if I reject her because I never saw anyone in my entire life try this hard for a relationship, also I do not wanna just have sex with her and then leave because no cap I think she would end up suicidal.**

My PCP called the police on me simply for saying I had returning SI,"My PCP called the police on me. My rights were completely violated to have the police show up at my home.

To back up, I had been told I need to come off my antidepressant (that eviserated my depression) because it is causing elevated liver enzymes.

All I said on the telehealth call is are my liver enzymes really that bad because in tapering off, I already feel my depression and SI returning. 

Rather than address my enzymes or evaluate my suicide risk (which was zero since I was not in crisis) she said you should go to a psych ward and I just said that‚Äôs ridiculous and unhelpful and not what I was asking about so I‚Äôm going to end this call (telehealth) and hung up.

What was he wanting to say?," 

We tend to see things from a one dimensional point of view in regards to *why* the killer in Idaho took the lives of 4 uniquely special, beautiful, talented, innocent, young people. He stole them from the world with no justified provocation and certainly no authority to do so. In trying to ascribe motive to that, there is a narrowing of reason that we cannot apply here. It is taken out of our perceptions and that really isn‚Äôt applicable, it must be filtered through the mind of the killer. There are categories, classifications and there are other killers we make comparisons between, but really there are no neat boxes to put a killer into. Each one has a very specific to them motivation. Something they were wanting to say to the world. 

This post is about how: **Personality really factors into motive.** 

`-An emotion,desire, physiological need, or similar impulse that acts as an incitement to action. =motive` 

A¬†mass murderer or serial murderer¬†can have multiple motives for committing crimes. The motives can be very difficult to determine.

Many attempt to make out what the killer wouldn‚Äôt do. It is almost inconceivable to go into a home and kill four people. It is easier I think to decide it was unintended. Maybe it‚Äôs safer. 

>!Crime that doesn‚Äôt follow a rationale, a rational goal or a payoff to a rational end, does not have a rational motive.!< If it is not clear what the reason for killing is, that usually means the motive is individualistic to the person and their view, something they were interested in doing and/needed to express. It lets you know they simply wanted to kill but not *why* they wanted to kill which can lead to who they wanted to kill, but not always.

We do not know of any connection between the accused Idaho4 killer and the victims. The killer of the Idaho4 made it personal by their choice of weapon, use of aggression and choice of victims.

>choice of weapon 

A knife is an intimate way to murder someone. It provides a closeness to the victim. It was not grabbed in its utility in the moment. The killer chose it and brought it with him. We have to assume expecting to use it, based on results. 

Sure a gun could be loud. It would also not afford the killer the hands on taking of a life, which is the ultimate control. It was important to the personality of the killer. In the data killing with *other* *than a gun* has a driver. 

>use of aggression 

The anger that he directed through the force of the stabbing and number of additional wounds with the knife was directed upon each victim. Even though the victims did nothing to deserve it and the rage was from the killers mind he projects it onto them. He caused undue pain to the victims so he likely wanted them to suffer for his own personal satisfaction. 

>choice of victims 

The victims were targeted, which is another word for chosen, personally by the killer. The reasons the victims were chosen fall into one or all of three categories: vulnerability, availability and desirability. 

Here is a nuance. This is true of *victim selection* but can be independent of MOTIVE. Saying he decided to kill MM for example because he saw and liked her picture does not mean his motive was born and it was to kill her. Both victim selection and motive are variables. 

Killers are often killing a ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù of something or someone. Dr. Gary Brucato calls it a ‚Äúprototype‚Äù. Because we don‚Äôt really understand the motive attempts are made to determine *who* the ‚Äúreal target was‚Äù.

Sometimes it seems like we are working the wrong way. Choosing who the target was and moving backwards into a motive. When really there is likely something that happened of significance in the killers life well before the crime. **There‚Äôs no reason to kill these people in this way unless to send a message or to express a fantasy and/ play out something emotionally.**

This reason likely existed before the victim or victims was ever selected. Trauma is the single recurring theme in the biographies of most killers. As¬†a consequence of this trauma, they suppress their emotional response. That is not a justification but is a commonality. 

# This crime is, by definition, a MASS MURDER. It does have elements of a person who would have a chronic and overwhelming psychological need to commit murder again, and again. 

There has been a lot said about the motive being school bullying or the inability to date women, sexual frustration, something along those lines. What we have seen in some more current culture mass shootings etc. 

When we look at the more typical traits of a mass murderer we see someone who is:

Vengeance seeking, usually directed against society at large

Marginalized 

Needing to Regain control 

Frustrated

Expressing a wicked rage for recognition

Feeling unappreciated: Is seeking attention they need and feel they deserve 

Personality Disordered: Narcissism, Psychopathy, Anti Social, Schizoid 

Exhibiting a fascination with the weapon of choice 

We can see that these traits could fit into this crime and the personality accused of the crime. 

The role of fantasy would also be important in a mass murderer creating a temporary refuge and/or a permanent escape. There is more usually a transcending fantasy that we do not see in this crime. 

What we do see are some of the same sub motivators, possibilities include: revenge,; and misogynistic payback; attention-seeking/reaction seeking‚Äîthe drive for infamy. These all are tied to **ego**. 

In a mass murder you can see methodical targeting of specific victims but a lot you see a murder-by-proxy. The Idaho crime could be by proxy and targeted as a vulnerable location. (Like a gun free zone can be a target or a place with a large gathering of people) The mass murder as the murder by proxy is usually not chosen out of any desirability making it less personal. Already outlying the things that do make the Idaho 4 killings more personal, there are other factors that make it look like a mass murderer who would go on to kill again. 

&#x200B;

* the killer disguised himself
* the killer made effort to get away with the crime 
* the killer did not commit suicide 
* the killer returned to the scene 
* the killer planned beyond the event 
* The killer did not present a manifesto

The larger portion of mass murderers are wanting to settle the score, with that being the final thing they do. 

This tells us there was something that he wanted to get out of committing these murders that he intended, this speaks to his personality and was part of the dominate motive and what he was saying. His ego told him he is important enough to do what he did and stay around and reap the ‚Äúrewards‚Äù as he would see it. Possibly even do it again and make it go even better. Perfect the methods. 

The nuance is, this probably wasn‚Äôt a one off like a school shooting. 

This killer does likely, as a mass murderer can, hold a grievance, the way it is more commonly used in criminology is it is more than just *being angry.* A grievance is a more longstanding and intense feeling that you've been wronged. So it's more than just anger. It doesn't dissipate. This is why I don‚Äôt believe he was actually motivated by a one time or sustained rejection from Kaylee, Madison or Xana. I see it more as brooding with an invitation of evil. Something may have occurred, but it wasn‚Äôt the start. It was more the aim for remedy.

The grievance can compel a mass murderer to act, but usually more in finality. 

This Idaho4 killers grievance combined with the fantasy life, that seems to have been an escalation of voyeurism, and his attempts to get away with the crime, would speak to the killer going on to commit murder again. It became more than just the bullying or inability to date. It was more than fixation on one girl. It is something in his **personality** that the killer wanted to relish in, some aspect of the crime and the aftermath of the crime. We will likely learn he injected himself into the discussion. He considered it an accomplishment no matter if he intended 3 and killed four or whatever. He wouldn‚Äôt have thought what have I done. 

There could have been a real or perceived slight from one of the girls. A wound to the ego would have happened though within a matrix of thoughts and ideas and wounds that already existed. Those wounds are what I think may be his focus. Endless failure makes you bitter and vengeful. He could never get people to like him, to not leave him. He would be motivated by his own wounded ego. He thinks he is something to behold but is made to feel like he is nothing. There is possibly a certain wound I believe that was a catalyst to the remedy being killing that he was visiting primarily on one of the girls. I am not convinced it was MM. If it was, I don‚Äôt believe it was her personally. It would be what she represented to him and could be applied to all the victims. If it was the one that doesn‚Äôt look like the other ones I think it was related to a specific wound. 

If he went on to offend again he would have chosen another prototype after an emotional cooling off period going through trolling and victim selection again. Would we be able to point to one person if he killed 4 people again? Would it be based on social media pictures or a letter in the window? I don‚Äôt believe so exactly. It would be based on a combination of the mentioned vulnerability, availability and desirability. Could he again *select* a location with easy access or in an environment of no alarms, coverage in the back, an ideal group with set schedules or similar, yes. But the reason he would select the victims based on desirability goes back to something he was expressing. There is something deeper going on and something that he was wanting to say through these murders, maybe all of them. Maybe all but one of them. 

This would be the correlation between personality and motive. 

His expression in life was he couldn‚Äôt quite figure people out. He couldn‚Äôt make them predictable. He tried to reduce it to a science. If I do this or that. He failed at it in general. I believe there was one failure he never recovered from. This is the one he was reeling from and never got over. His expression in killing was to make that person predictable and never be able to leave him. Something like, because he took the life of someone who symbolized them, for that reason they would always be his. He may have imo also chosen someone associated with that person or someone who stood in his way of him getting at that person. Mass murder. 

**IF THIS WAS ALSO MORE OF A SERIAL MURDERER TYPE** 

>!The first phase!< of a killer is to delve deep into a world of fantasy. 

There could be a grudge he held for a very long time. The grudge could have nothing to do directly with any of these young women or young man at all. The fantasy is one of getting back for the insult or injury or resentment for the wrong. It is usually aimed at women and it becomes entangled in sexual material and can become a fantasy that produces sexual gratification. It is complex and the sexual motive can be secondary.

In >!the second or trolling phase!< of a serial murderer they are assessing prey and they are looking for a victim or they are scouting a location in one or all of the mentioned categories: availability, vulnerability and desirability. 

This crime is more predatory than we see in most mass murders where they are focused on vulnerability and availability. In this crime one of the victims would likely be incorporated into the fantasy to ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù the ability to get back again what the killer sees he lost or what the killer wants that he doesn‚Äôt have. This is why the desirability component of victim selection is so specific to the killers psyche. It may end up being the person everyone seems to find most obvious but it isn‚Äôt predictable that way. **And it is why serial killers can still kill if they find the other two components, an opportune, vulnerable victim.** 

That‚Äôs the nuance. The reason he would have selected one of them, (if in fact it was only one) the why of that, could be who his prototype may be. Again this is independent of motive to kill but could be related*.* A prototype is an original model on which something is patterned.

Finding a picture on the internet of one of the girls and fixating on them is not *the* motive. It is not the causes of what made the killer to act. Watching one of the girls through her window for long periods of time was not *the* motive. It was not the causes of what made the killer to act. One of the victims looking like an ex is not *the* motive.It was not the causes of what made the killer to act. 

The motive in this crime based on what is known of the methods of the killer and the crime scene, along with the M.O. or the how of what he did, blitz attacking in the night people in a vulnerable state with a knife, speaks to a need for total power, control and domination. There is usually a dominant motive and the other motives are secondary. Because the overt sexual assault is absent it says that it was more predominantly motivated by **ego**, and more specifically a wound to the ego. Probably longstanding. 

A person would want to do this if they felt out of control if they wanted to level up if they had been left powerless by some person or situation. 

Is that the *why?* It may or may not directly attach to one of these victims. 

This is probably boring for most but for me, It is about, what was he wanting to say?

(Spoilers Extended) Yet another parentage theory (sorry): Ned fooled Varys," This theory is more of a loosely formed set of observations and ideas that center around the post-Robert's Rebellion shenanigans in Dorne. I am approaching this theory from the standpoint of *If this is false, can I find contradictions in the text?* I welcome people to comment and contribute anything that might weigh in one way or the other, as I don't think this theory is bulletproof or in a finalized form yet. I also suspect someone has thought of all this before me or might just know the timeline well enough to disprove it. I haven't been able to kill the idea so far and it's nagging me enough to write this up.

A couple premises this theory assumes to be true from the start:

**1.	R + L = J. I won't support this with evidence as it's been done already 1000 times over**

**2.	Varys knows R + L = ?. He is aware Rhaegar and Lyanna had a child. Below I will work to support this premise.**

**3.	Ned knows or suspects that Varys and/or others know about R + L = ?. I will also work to support this premise.**

**4.	Ashara Dayne had a child with a Stark. I will not support this with evidence as it has also been discussed 1000 times over in more detail elsewhere. I will softly support that this Stark is Brandon, but am open to Ned as an alternative.** 

Evidence for premise #2: Varys knows R + L = ?

Varys was known to be hired with the purpose of spying on the Mad King's family, including Rhaegar.

*""Convinced that the smallfolk and lords were plotting against his life and fearing that even Queen Rhaella and Prince Rhaegar might be part of these plots, he reached across the narrow sea to Pentos and imported a eunuch named Varys to serve as his spymaster""*

It is an in world theory/assumption that Rhaegar used the Tourney at Harrenhal as a cover to conspire against his father. Aerys is stated to have believed this himself and it stands to reason he would have ordered his spymaster, Varys, to surveil Rhaegar.

*""The prince, it is said, had no interest in the tourney as a tourney; his intent was to gather the great lords of the realm together in what amounted to an informal Great Council, in order to discuss ways and means of dealing with the madness of his father, King Aerys II, possibly by means of a regency or a forced abdication.""*

*""Above all, King Aerys II was suspicious: suspicious of his own son and heir, Prince Rhaegar""*

Varys would obviously know about Rhaegar crowning Lyanna queen of the tourney and also know  when later the next year Lyanna would be traveling with Rhaegar in an *""infamous abduction""* of some sort. I have no textual evidence that Varys knew the location that Rhaegar took Lyanna to, but it stands to reason that he would have had spies reporting on Rhaegar's location, or at least attempting to. Varys would also likely know aspects of Rhaegar's personality, possibly including the extend to which Rhaegar was obsessed with having three offspring to fulfill a prophecy. All of this alone is reason enough for Varys to deduce that Rhaegar likely impregnated Lyanna. At this point Rhaegar would have to be extremely skilled to keep Varys from knowing this information. He just created the biggest news story in Westeros by abducting Lyanna, whom he also publicly declared his love for, and then manages to disappear? Nah. He wasn't alone either.

**It is simply incredibly unlikely that Varys knows all of the above and doesn't at least consider that Lyanna died in birthing a child.** He knows Rhaegar publicly announced her queen of love and beauty, publicly abducted her, raped her (according to Robert), and that she died, and that Ned leaves Dorne with a little Stark baby. Frankly it's amazing half the court doesn't know R + L = J. It's only an obscure thought because George is working overtime to obfuscate it from the reader, but to these in universe characters, especially ones with a massive spy network that is already surveilling half of the R + L equation, this should be obvious. Once you accept the premise that Varys SHOULD know about R + L, there are sort of only two paths: he knows, and now we need to explain his actions in that context, or he doesn't know and GRRM is just thumbing the scale a bit so R + L = J can still be a secret.

Evidence for premise #3: Ned knows Varys knows

Ned disdains Varys, before meeting him at the start of AGOT.

*""The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered""*

Ned and Varys would have likely crossed paths before after the sack of King's Landing, as they were both present in the city. We know that Ned did not hang around KL long, as he was disgusted by Robert's acceptance of the Elia Martel situation, but there is a potential the two interacted here. Also in AGOT he seems to know Varys by reputation as well. Varys's reputation alone is enough for Ned to suspect Varys knows. I don't have a lot of textual evidence for this, but I think it is fairly logical for Ned to realize that if he leaves Dorne with a baby then prying eyes are going to guess that baby came from Lyanna. He isn't the type to have bastards, which is something people know about him, and he arrived specifically to retrieve Lyanna. Lyanna is dead. He suddenly has a baby. Was he even in Dorne long enough to knock someone up and have them give birth? The story has holes and any adult in Ned's shoes would realize it. He's down in Dorne with a lot of dead friends, few options, and a little baby with royal blood that will be murdered if people figure that out. He desperately needs a cover story for this baby and ""it's mine"" is only going to fool the average person. So who does he turn to to get another cover for this baby?

Bulk of the theory:

**TLDR: Ned bought even more cover for baby Jon's identity by making it appear that Jon was actually Ashara's child, by him or Brandon. This makes Jon appear to be half Dayne half Stark, and he looks like a Stark, so it works. Ashara's child, who would be half Dayne, half Stark and possibly have Dayne features (purple eyes, blonde/silver hair) would be the perfect substitute for anyone looking for a Stark-Targ baby. This is the baby Varys eventually raises to be Aegon, commonly called fAegon. Ned tricks Varys into thinking Aegon is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar, and Jon is just the bastard of Ashara and Brandon (or Ned himself). So Ned and/or Ashara pull a fast one on anyone observant enough to know about BOTH these kids: they take advantage of the rumors (or truths) about their romance, pretend it resulted in one of these children- the Stark looking one. They act like real nobility would in this scenario- act embarrassed, keep it hush hush. Varys believes he knows their secret and won't look much farther and discover THE secret. Ned effectively faked the origin of his child, Jon, as Starfall and not the Tower of Joy.**

Exactly what point Varys falls for this or obtains custody of Aegon is not clear, perhaps Ned even voluntarily sent Aegon with Varys/his agents. 

&#x200B;

Things that fit nicely with this theory:

‚¶Å	Aegon's appearance can be explained by his Dayne heritage

‚¶Å	Aegon's temper, which Tyrion interprets as a Targaryen aspect, is actually the ""wolf blood"" of his father Brandon

‚¶Å	Fits nicely if Ashara is Septa Lemore theory - she gets to raise her kid in Essos

‚¶Å	Fits nicely to explain Ashara's suicide if that actually happened - Ned really did steal her kid

‚¶Å	Cersei got fooled by this move- she thinks Ned stole a baby from Ashara

‚¶Å	Makes the situation parallel the ADWD babyswap even more. Have one baby with dangerous identity and one without. Swap babies and send one far away.

‚¶Å	The pisswater prince story is dodgy. Varys saved only Elia's son, during the sack, last minute? 

‚¶Å	There is still a compelling reason for Varys and/or Illyrio to lie and pretend Aegon is Elia's son. That child was not a bastard and would have a much stronger claim to the Iron Throne

‚¶Å	This is consistent with several character's confused and contradictory information on the whole Ned/Lyanna/Ashara/Rhaegar/Brandon situation

‚¶Å	There is still motivation/means for Varys and/or Illyrio to court the Golden Company. If they think he's a Blackfyre, all the better.

‚¶Å	In Vary's speech to Kevan, he makes no statements about Aegon's parentage or whom he inherits his claim from. Kevan assumes Varys is talking about Aegon of Elia Martel.",1b1sco5,5,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1b1sco5/spoilers_extended_yet_another_parentage_theory/,"['Why would Ned protect his sister‚Äôs child but not his brother‚Äôs (or his own)?', 'You lost me at Ashara‚Äôs child being a Stark.

What Do You Like About Trench?,"I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind.

I had a limited awareness of Twenty One Pilots when Blurryface first came out in 2015. I was thirteen and suicidal, so they were massively popular among my demographic, but the music I listened to was mostly Vocaloid and J-pop, so I only heard Ride and Stressed Out on the radio and liked them well enough.

Around early 2017 my mental health conditions got much worse and I started spiraling into religious psychosis. I started listening to Twenty One Pilots more, going back through their discography, and absolutely fell in love with their music. So many of their songs spoke to exactly where I was in life and what I was goin through, and even the ones that didn‚Äôt were still really good, in my opinion. Here are some of my favorites and least favorites on each album:

**Self-Titled**  
Faves: Johnny Boy, Oh Ms. Believer, Fall Away  
Least Faves: Addict With a Pen, A Car, A Torch, A Death, Isle of Flightless Birds

**Regional At Best** (the ones not repeated on later albums)  
Faves: Ruby, Lovely, Anathema  
Least Faves: Slowtown, Kitchen Sink, Be Concerned

**Vessel**  
Faves: Ode to Sleep, The Run and Go, Trees  
Least Faves: Car Radio, Semi-Automatic, Fake You Out

**Blurryface**  
Faves: The Judge, Tear in My Heart, Polarize  
Least Faves: Not Today, Message Man, Doubt

When Trench was announced, I was over the moon. I followed the ARG religiously. I bought the very first Trench hoodie and t-shirt that showed up at my local Hot Topic. I made OCs and speculated about Dema, and the album appeared in my dreams multiple times. Suffice it to say, I was hyped. 

When Jumpsuit and Nico and the Niners came out, I listened to them on repeat for hours, but I thought they were just okay. I figured that the rest of the album would be better, as the singles from Blurryface weren‚Äôt my favorites either. When Levitate came out was when I started to get a bit worried, though, as I didn‚Äôt care for it at all. When the album officially came out, I gave it a listen as soon as the songs were uploaded on YouTube.

Guys, I hated this album. I still hate this album. I truly do not understand how it‚Äôs ranked so high on everyone‚Äôs lists and labeled Twenty One Pilot‚Äôs ‚Äúmasterpiece.‚ÄùWhen I first discovered this subreddit I was actually shocked by how many people hold this album in such high esteem, because I thought it was so obviously subpar that I didn‚Äôt even consider that some people would love it.

This is legitimately not meant as a dig, or meant to be shady or backhanded or passive-aggressive or anything like that. I just honestly don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt see this album as being a huge step back for them. I still enjoy some of their older music and think they‚Äôre very capable of making good music, I just don‚Äôt see that in Trench. There are maybe two songs on there that I think are decent, but I never go back to listen to them, and the subject matter always read as a lot more nonsensical than their older albums.

So, Trench fans, what do you like about the album? It could be something sonically or lyrically, or maybe just some good memories you have attached to the album. I want to get a variety of different opinions so that I can hopefully come to appreciate it more, even if I‚Äôm not going to like it personally.

(For the record, I did listen to Scaled and Icy and thought it was just okay, if slightly better than Trench. Here are my rankings for that and Trench!)

**Trench**  
Decent The Hype, My Blood, Legend  
Worst of the Worst: Pet Cheetah, Cut My Lip, Levitate

**Scaled and Icy**  
Faves: Shy Away, Choker (minus the rap part, I find that atrocious), Formidable

I have a question about unalive,"So  ""unalive"" is the acceptable term for suicide
... But why?

I have always used the term murder. 

Example:
I am going to murder myself.
I tried to murder myself. 
I murdered myself. 

I feel that fits a bit better than unalive.

One part of me took the time and effort to plan, scheme and carry out a murder against my sad, depressed, non working self in hopes it would lead to joyous feelings. 

Unalive sounds like another word for stillborn.

do i just prepare myself to lose someone to suicide? i‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore,"my boyfriend (19) tells me he never wanted to be alive. he doesn‚Äôt want help. he says he doesn‚Äôt think anything could help him. i just feel so at loss because he is. he‚Äôs attempted before and every once in awhile he goes into that dark place where he feels like he can‚Äôt even live for us. i try to convince him to get help and i always tell him im here for him. he sleeps all day until he works and then when he comes back from work he goes back to sleep. as much as i want to believe he can make it out of this, he doesn‚Äôt seem to believe in himself, which makes me question like am i going to me supporting him through our life together or supporting him till he eventually snaps. i love this man with my whole heart and i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. i don‚Äôt want him to think i‚Äôve given up and im NOT giving up, but i just don‚Äôt know  what to do at this point.

My best friend left me for 2 boys.,"Me, and my friend (let‚Äôs call her wini) are both 13 year old girls. I have met her in 7th grade and we had been best friends ever since. Recently, she started slowly ignoring me and seemed annoyed by me. While she was doing this, these 2 boys (let‚Äôs call them Brad and Jeff) started to give her attention. Brad and Jeff were like this to wini since 7th grade, and had a fat crush on her. I hate these boys, because they are racist and make rape jokes, one even sending her a weird picture. The problem is, one day  wini sat far away from me, and sat in between these boys, COMPLETELY ignoring me. I found this weird at first, because she stopped talking to them because they got too weird, and now she won‚Äôt stop laughing at their jokes (very unfunny jokes üòí). I tried talking to her about this but she acts stupid and sees nothing wrong with this, or just laughs and says mhm. I honestly just want to be best friends again, but when I try go up to her she runs away ( and no, I did nothing wrong or different. It was just a normal day for me, until she just left me.)

Today in class, wini was not here today. Jeff (the worst one) would NOT leave me alone. He kept touching me, trying to be funny, and sat beside me in every class. I was very uncomfortable, and tried to make that clear. He knows I hate him, but he won‚Äôt leave me alone. When ever I move, he follows me everywhere. I hate him, because when I try to stick up for wini, he calls me a bitch, hopes I kms, etc. I don‚Äôt know what to do right now, because my best friend hates me and is acting like a pick me, and if I even talk to Brad or Jeff, she gives me this look I can‚Äôt describe, like she hates me and just wants me to die. Jeff won‚Äôt take a hint that he‚Äôs a creep, and Brad swarms wini. I‚Äôm very scared about this, because I told wini all my secrets and this could ruin everyone‚Äôs view of me.

I feel like minion AI has gotten so awful and it‚Äôs never talked about ,"For reference, I am a former diamond player coming off of a long term break. I have played this game since season 2. My main account is HateDaddy, I have been farming blue essence on my Smurf AdmiralShaykul because I have everything on my main (own all champs, have a ridic surplus of blue essence, that happens when you‚Äôre as old as dirt like me). Both accounts are NA. 

Now that verification is out of the way, I just have to say oh my flipping gosh. Minions have no consistency at all in targeting champions, enemy minions, and routing. For absolutely no reason at all, a melee minion will be whaling on another enemy minion then decide to completely forgo all life‚Äôs glory and suicide under tower when nothing even remotely aggro‚Äôd him. They also stack up under tower now in no sort of rhythm or synchrony, it‚Äôs like watching a drunk toddler stack building blocks on a steep ramp - I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. Further I have no idea how to even start targeting minions, whether under tower or not, because they may decide all at once that my existence is futile and I am not allowed to move again as I get flash froze in minion block that I didn‚Äôt even consent to.

(36) I just had the most VALIDATING session with my therapist!," 

Hey there,

I am a 36 year old AMAB and had my egg cracked wide open 6 months ago. I am in a loving heteronormative relationship with a younger lady and the egg cracking has caused some issues, especially since I want to explore with men and other dick havers.

I have been going to therapy for the last 6 months with a gender identity specialized care provider and have had access to HRT for 5 of those months but I have been taking them for a week and then stopping. Cis, trans, cis, trans. My mind kept flip flopping to one extreme to the other. From wanting to be with my partner and having a ""normal"" life with her and maybe having kids (not biologically because I had a vasectomy at 30 due to not wanting to pass on my mental illnesses) and then to full blown hypersexual trans feelings. I was having extremely suicidal thoughts this morning, journaled them down and then went to my therapist early because I had no where else to go and was crying, miserable (like it was before I got medicated for Bipolar Type 2 and Borderline Personality Disorder which my meds have been working great except the last 6 months).

I go into the session and she asks if I want to go first or she may have uncovered something that might resonate with me. I told her to go first and she began to tell me how she came across something called ""autogynephilia"" which is a type of sexuality that some trans women have and causes them to transition. It is a hypersexualism where an AMAB fantasizes and wishes to experience sexual things as a woman in an intense and obsessive manner. Much of my desire to transition is very sexual and many other people have been telling me that is not what trans is about it is about gender identity. Which I agree, but to hear that my desire born from an intense sexual desire was ok and kind of sort of studied was very validating and realized I wasn't alone.

Not sure how the trans community feels about this as I am relatively new, but it made me feel so much better about my desires and who I wanted to be and who I wanted to have sex with.

"Advice on ex-bisexual friends and toxicity at home - London, UK note: mentions of abvse and bisexuality."," 

This info is all females (including myself), other than the mentioned males (i.e. my father, brother, etc):

When I was younger, I identified as bisexual. This was partly due to friends who were at the time too.

Anyway my friends and I have since identified as straight, and we all know this is the case.

I do not consider myself homophobic in the traditional sense, and neither are my friends. To explain my personal views, I wouldn't cut contact someone simply because i found out they were gay. It would be an issue, and i may distance myself slightly, but would not cut contact over one character flaw. I think the act is haram, but no one can stop bad thoughts (speaking as someone who was borderline suicidal.) So fine, think whatever. Do anything else, and then sinful.

&#x200B;

The issue lies within my parents - who want me to cut contact with these friends over a mistake they made as kids. Yes, they did partially influence me. Yes, it was my final decision.

When they found out about this when i was 17, they were abvsive (or at least i think of the period as such. my brother said they were right to act the way they did, so i question it).

They physically beat me once that meant i had a limp for two weeks. I was alienated at home, and not given food the same time as my family. They threatened to kick me out. I don't remember much of it, due to getting sick with Corona the same time and my grandfather dying not long before - its a bit of a blur, but some things i remember distinctly.

Anyway, now... 3 years later my parents don't understand why i'm friends with them. They don't understand how I can respect people like that. I don't know how to make them realise that my friends are good people (one's dad is a local imam, the other's mum teaches at an Islamic school and is helping me with Quran. they and their parents have supported me with my own relationship with Deen, listening to my struggles, encouraging me and supporting me and reminding me of Allah).

My parents are horrible to me as a result of this. 

What do I do?

Why are you friends with them? Even if it is halal, which in your case I highly doubt, you do not have to be friends with them or anyone.\n\nWhy not distance yourself from people who are a bad influence? \n\nDon't confuse your anger at your parents with haram and halal. Many rebellious kids would take a drug addiction just to spite their parents. Don't need to tell you that the person you are hurting most is you.\n\nKeep halal and pious friends, avoid others.

Why not start with who they are rn and the fact that they have good families and help you with quran.\n\nSecondly, I realize you've been through a lot with these friends and have all seemed to turn a corner, your parents perspective is kinda valid. Struggling alcoholics are advised not to hang out with friends they used to drink with even if they've stopped drinking. It can be a situational cue. If you're sure that it won't be a problem for you, keep talking to your parents and keep trying to convince them. Keep calm and polite and patient. Most of all, make sure you catch them at a good time so as to not be annoying.\n\nThirdly and perhaps most importantly, your parents beat you up where you had a limp for aa week?! It sounds like a dangerous situation. And if you're in danger, disregard what I wrote previously and find a safe place for yourself. Do you have family you can reach out for help?""]"
"maybe heart attack coming, not going to Dr or telling anyone","This will be long and rambling for sure, because so many things I want to say, and don't have the energy to sit and write in in a cohesive way.  I actually think I'm a fairly decent writer, I just am venting and don't care anymore about anything.

I (50M) keep having weird feelings in my chest, over the weekend I walked up a small hill and got super out of breath.  Had a similar weird feeling yesterday.  My grandfather had a heart attack and died at 41.

I can't believe how out of breath I got, it was scary.  I was an athlete, I did sports all my life and always had good stamina.

I owned a business and was self-employed for 13 years.  I lost my business during covid.  I also went through a divorce at the same time.  My ex-wife and I were not in a good place, I wanted things to work, but I caught her with another man.  I don't think I ever recovered from these two simultaneous losses.  Ever since then, I am pretty apathetic to most things.  I work a bullshit job now just to pay bills.  It's hard to find something when you are 50, don't have a college degree, and were self-employed for that long, so you don't have job references etc they can call.  I also don't have insurance, and been neglecting my health because I felt ok most of the time until recently.

I went through a lot of stuff growing up, abuse, bullying, etc.  My parents marriage was bad, and there was a lot of chaos in the home.  I had a best friend as a kid, who had a similar home situation, we would play together in the woods as much as we could, and not be home unless we had to.  When I would be away from the house, I would forget my problems, but when it was time to go home, I was always afraid.  What happened while I was gone?  What would be happening when I got home?

I have been spending time with a lady for about 3.5 years, I love her incredibly but I feel it's not mutual.  She treats me very nice, but never expresses her feelings, and seems like she is uncomfortable when I try to.  I feel like everybody around me takes me for granted.  I am mechanically inclined, I can fix cars and most household things, so most of the time people want me to do stuff for them, or explain stuff to them.  Never just call/text to see how I am doing.  They always want something.  I have cut off a lot of people for this reason.  I only consider that I have 2 friends, they both live out of state.  Even my cat is kind of an asshole to me now, he is 13, had him since he was a young kitten.

The best time of my life was when I was training, I trained for 12 years with some famous fighters.  I fought but was not famous.  I was able to be a fighter because I had experienced violence from a young age and it wasn't a big adjustment.  Those were the best relationships I ever had.  I reached out to my trainer today, he asked how I was doing, I said ""honestly I am struggling"", but I did not respond when he asked me what was going on.  

I have numerous injuries from training, I walk like an old man from my back, neck, knees, etc, and I can't do things like I used to.  My hands hurt from punching, and holding tools.  I have bumpy ears, a slightly crooked nose, and a missing tooth.  I also worry about dementia, etc, both my grandmothers had dementia and didn't get punched in the head for 12 years.  I have told people I would commit suicide if I was diagnosed with dementia, and I meant it.  It was horrible to watch, and I couldn't go through that.  I used to feel that's how I would die, until lately. 

I loathe superficiality, and I am not fake.  If I don't like someone I can't pretend that I do, and many times my life would have been easier if I could accomplish this.  I can't connect with people, I'm sure this is due to my childhood and keeping people at a comfortable distance, but also the training thing, I just feel like I went through something so intense that most people don't understand.  One of my 2 friends was in the military, he says similar things about the relationships he had with Marines he served with.  He understands me.  My other friend also trained, went through an abusive childhood, so he gets me, but I don't want to tell them how defeated I am.  It's hard being unable to connect with ""normal"" people.  My ladyfriend says I have social issues or whatever, yeah I'm sure I do, but don't make me feel like a bad person because I can't sit around with her friend's husband/boyfriend/whoever while they get drunk and talk about the job they work together the whole time, and exclude me from the conversation.  I just zone out and think about what I could be doing with my time.  But I am good enough to fix their cars.  And I do this to please her, when I should say ""no"" if I am so unlikeable.  She says I need counseling.  I just wish she could have listened to me.  

If I am going to die soon, I am fine with that.  It will be a relief.  I don't have the courage to end my life, so it gives me an easy out.  I just wish one person in my life could have allowed me my pain.  I wish one person could have listened to me, and understood.",1b1s0cz,20,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1b1s0cz/maybe_heart_attack_coming_not_going_to_dr_or/,"[""Thank you for pouring out your heart, mind and soul in your post.\n\nI definitely see your perspective and can understand the extreme strain being put on ones physical and mental state is when you feel betrayed, untrusting, disappointed from pretty much every aspect of your life, physical mental and professional.\n\nWish i could give you a hug and sit down n chat with a nice single malt ! :)\n\nOkay this may sound like I'm trivialising your post but trust me not the intention....

"just wanted advice : facing Family problem ,Emotional Abuse ,and study prblms"," 

I'm a 19-year-old girl, currently preparing for the JEE. Two years ago, I was caught with a boyfriend, and you probably know how it goes in Indian families, especially middle-class ones‚Äîit was like a tragedy. The drama continued for a year at home, where I faced beatings, verbal abuse, and emotional torture. I wasn't even allowed to have my phone for a year. Eventually, things calmed down a bit, but the discrimination based on gender by my family persisted.

Life was tough, especially as my JEE january session exams approached, but I couldn't score well. Despite trying to cope, I couldn't bring myself to break up with my boyfriend yet. When I attempted to end the relationship, he threatened to call my parents, fearing another round of drama, so I continued talking to him daily for 30 minutes while also working hard on my studies. Life was kind of okay, but tension always lingered between my family and me because of their discrimination between me and my brother.

Just ten days ago, I got caught chatting with my boyfriend again. My mom is extremely narrow-minded and has been restricting me since childhood, not even allowing me to talk to my cousin brother or make decisions for myself without their approval. After getting caught, my studies took a nosedive, and my phone was snatched away again. Now, with the JEE exam(april attemp) just 30 days away, I'm struggling to deal with it all. On top of that, my mom verbally abuses me, calling me names like ""ladkebaaz ,and even ""whore."" My dad, who used to be loving until two years ago, has also changed by getting influenced by my mother . He now hits me when I speak up and constantly tells me to commit suicide and pray ki i should die.

Breeders are basically saying its ACCEPTABLE for the unlucky FEW to SUFFER for the lucky MANY in this world.,"We all know Utopia is impossible and some people WILL suffer, badly, totally net negative lives. 

Note: Some breeders even deny this, lol, they claim that even the worst sufferers are somewhat happy about existing. So basically no such thing as unhappy sufferers for them, the 800K annual suicide deaths, 3 million repeated attempts and 100s of millions of incurable sufferers are ALL somewhat HAPPY and GLAD to be alive, according to their very ""FACTUAL"" claim. LOL 

They wont admit it, but when you push them for an answer, they will eventually say the risk is worth it, the statistic is worth it, the suffering of the unlucky few is worth the happiness of the lucky many. 

Note: How many is many? No idea, breeders cant give me a number. Maybe 80% of people on earth? I doubt its that high, lol. More like 30% in my opinion. 

This is WHY they breed, because the probability of creating an unlucky sufferer is low enough for them, so even if it happens to their children, its STILL worth it, because STATISTICALLY its worth it. lol 

Does this sound moral to you? 

What will they say to the few suffering children/adult they've created? lol

I 18M want to break up with my girlfriend 16F but I don‚Äôt know how to ( we have been together for 1 year and 5 months),"A little background: I was born and raised in a certain country in Africa ,I was a quiet kid who kept to myself a lot although  I had a lot of friends cause of school so I was never lonely . I attended school from elementary up to the first year of high school, where I then moved to the USA to attend my 2nd year of high school and this was the time COVID hit making us go into quarantine (during which I barely communicated with people outside except for my cousins who I was staying with at the time, one was in high school with me and the other one was still in elementary school, I like to think that I grew more anxious, nervous  and introverted during this time due to no socialization, I didn‚Äôt have no friends to talk to or socialize) .I  only attended 2 weeks of my sophomore year , all junior year I was still in quarantine and went back to school in my senior year but the first semester had a lot regulations and I still had to wear a mask which kinda impeded me from speaking cause people wouldn‚Äôt hear me cause of my accent. The second semester, most of the regulations were lifted but I had no social skills so I never really talked to anybody except for some immigrants who I met close to graduation. 
After graduation, I moved to my mom‚Äôs apartment in a different city , which felt like a whole new beginning. I decided to take a gap year because I was really scared of joining college at the time.  At this time I got my second job at a pizza and deli restaurant nearby where I met my gf( let‚Äôs call her Essence) . She showed me the ropes and as she was a loud , talkative individual, she got to know me a lot by asking me a lot of questions, I got comfortable around her before my other coworkers, but we soon all became friends.
Essence then asked me for my instagram and we started texting there, I was kinda excited cause I had never gone this far with a girl , she then asked for my phone number and we started FaceTiming , but I was a still kinda awkward and silent , so we didn‚Äôt ft a lot. But then one day she asked me on a date but she told me that the responsibility of planning for it will be on me .We had a movie date. 
On the day of the date , I picked her up with my mom‚Äôs car and drove her to the theater . While the movie was going on , she made the first move and held my hand, I kinda tensed up and started thinking of a way to match the energy. After the movie , on our walk back to the car, I gently grabbed her chin and kissed her. I drove back to her place and we smoked someüçÉ she had then I went back to my place. ( I was still new to smoking so I was really faded) . After I got home , she FaceTimed me and after talking for a while , she asked me, ‚Äú What are we ?‚Äù . I answered back that I didn‚Äôt know and I needed more time to think . She then hang up the phone.( I remember this conversation  only because  it kinda lowered my high but I was still very high as my head was really spinning)
She then called back a few minutes later and said the she just got off the phone with her then boy best friend ( let‚Äôs call him Luke) . She told me ,‚ÄùYou don‚Äôt know how it feels when you like somebody but they don‚Äôt like you back.‚Äù And she had to go talk to Luke about it . She said all this while crying. There was a silent moment, and I was feeling really terrible at this moment hearing her cry so I asked her to be my girlfriend and she cheered up. So since then we have been dating , I tried to break up with her once around sometime last year but my reason was not valid( I wanted to break up with her cause I wanted to mess around with some other girl) so we got back together like a week later cause I said we should stay friends and keep FaceTiming. Which i know wasn‚Äôt a good plan and the reason we got back together so fast. 
The relationship has been rocky , like a usual relationship, but around the 5th month in, I started questioning if I really liked her , I have never gotten any type of feeling that suggest so but I‚Äôve stayed in the relationship with my main reason being , ‚Äú that it would be nice to have a wife who I have had a relationship with since our teenage years. At the same time I‚Äôve been smoking üçÉ for most of our relationship and she has been smoking way before we even met. Another reason I have stayed is cause she is a really depressed girl, and I don‚Äôt want her to ever commit suicide cause I broke up with her. Her relationship with both her parents is not good . She lives with her mom and her younger sister and all of them smoke including her mom. I‚Äôve been over to their house a couple times and it is not in the best state. Essence has told me that I am one of the only people who are the reason to why she doesn‚Äôt kill her self. She has self harmed twice while in the relationship, and I‚Äôve tried my best to be there for her and most of the time I‚Äôve succeeded but It never felt like it‚Äôs out of love but more like caring about  her as a person, cause I personally don‚Äôt believe nobody should go through depression alone. 
I recently joined college and haven‚Äôt smoked üçÉ since the start of the year as a personal goal of myself for self improvement. In this time I have really been thinking about a lot of things especially this relationship. I have made goals to make my life better day by day through self improvement as i don‚Äôt want to fuck up college .( it‚Äôs a lot of money which we don‚Äôt haveüòÖ) but I‚Äôve made a promos to myself to world hard so I can get that degree and hopefully get a good job where I can support my mom and the rest of my family back in Africa and pay off the debt am gonna haveü•≤. 
But since I‚Äôve stopped smoking üçÉ I‚Äôve felt more in control and more conscious. So I realized this relationship is not what I really wanted , I probably just stayed in it and tolerated it for long cause I was lonely and she is the only person I talked to. The only people on my call log are literally her and my mother . 
And am not going to lie, I also realized my type of girl and she is not it .
Here are the moments I realized that am not in love with her: 1. I never have anything good to say when someone asks me about our relationship, 2. I am never excited when I‚Äôm about to talk to her 3. A lot of times I really don‚Äôt listen to what she be saying ( and she be talking a lot) 4. My heart has never raced or skipped a beat when I see or meet up with her . ( I once met this girl at another job I worked late last year and we became friends, and all the time I saw or talked with her, I felt some type of way plus my heart always raced when I was near her. I think this is what really sealed my mind about Essence) 5. She be getting on my nerves a lot with the things she either do, or says , and they are the regular relationship stuff like her being clingy , or her hugging me for really long .
I would like to break up with her when I go back home for spring break but her grandfather just passed away and she has been excited for my return , I‚Äôm not though.  
But don‚Äôt get me wrong, she is a good girlfriend, She has talked about how much she loves me , but I think it‚Äôs an attachment thing . She has cooked for me, she always says she loves me I‚Äôve said it back and always tried to mean it but I‚Äôve never felt any heart behind the 3 words . Like if I tell my mother I love her, I feel the weight of the words but with Essence it feels empty (if y‚Äôall know what I mean)
We have slept together before but I‚Äôve never enjoyed it  ( we were both virgins before we met ) so I also feel like that is a major factor . And I always go soft after some minute but if I beat my own meat , I can last for long. 
She is plus size too , but It‚Äôs never really bothered me , but I heard from somewhere that if I truly love someone I will never want them to change, but I‚Äôve been wanting her to change her self since the early days although I never tried to force it on her or talk about it . 
So I want to break up with her soon , I know it‚Äôs going to be hard , more on her than me , but y‚Äôall think it‚Äôs a good idea to break up with her on my spring break? ( it‚Äôs 2 weeks away)

TLDR : Basically I want to break up with my gf as I learnt that I am not really in love with her as I thought , and she is a depressed person . ",1b1rtor,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/comments/1b1rtor/i_18m_want_to_break_up_with_my_girlfriend_16f_but/,[]

I‚Äôve been like this for the past 7-8 years and for the most part it was just an underlying desire I would indulge in if I was feeling stressed, apart from a few long and particularly bad periods surrounding painful family/life events.

It gets harder to fantasize about a better future the more time passes and as your body keeps breaking down. \n\nA massive problem when you feel this way is stagnation. Its agonizing, and it builds up tremendous resentment towards yourself. When you\'re a child, things are always changing/progressing because your body is changing/progressing. We have to learn how to make change and progress for ourselves now as adults.  You already know that you need to keep it moving so i wont harp on that. But look at it this way.

Life was tough, especially as my JEE january session exams approached, but I couldn't score well. Despite trying to cope, I couldn't bring myself to break up with my boyfriend yet. When I attempted to end the relationship, he threatened to call my parents, fearing another round of drama, so I continued talking to him daily for 30 minutes while also working hard on my studies. Life was kind of okay, but tension always lingered between my family and me because of their discrimination between me and my brother.

Just ten days ago, I got caught chatting with my boyfriend again. My mom is extremely narrow-minded and has been restricting me since childhood, not even allowing me to talk to my cousin brother or make decisions for myself without their approval. After getting caught, my studies took a nosedive, and my phone was snatched away again. Now, with the JEE exam(april attemp) just 30 days away, I'm struggling to deal with it all. On top of that, my mom verbally abuses me, calling me names like ""ladkebaaz ,and even ""whore.""

"PUK ""end of titration review"" tomorrow/today and anxious","Hi all,

In true ADHD fashion, I am worrying away about what the ""end of titration review"" will involve from PUK. I have filled out all the monitoring forms, and I don't know what else there is to say. I need to mentally prepare myself for it. It is currently feeling very difficult.

There's medication shortages currently and have been formally told on-record to ""ration"" what little medication I have left, so anxiety all over the place, mood and emotions everywhere, feeling a mess to be perfectly honest. These hoops we need to jump through, despite lack of availability in appropriate treatment is appalling.

What does the end of titration review involve? I know I need another Microsoft Teams appointment for it, but what does it actually involve? Got all sorts of screwed up concerns and anxiety about it. I just need to know what they are going to expect from me and ask of me. How long does it last? It's a new person as well, not who I was diagnosed by, because they don't work there anymore. Anxiety off the charts about it.

Also not sure what to say regarding the state of play. Yes, the medication definitely improves my life to an appreciable extent, but the shortages are terrible, and it doesn't fix everything in my life, and obviously being off of it when I run out again or having reduced doses in the meantime is rough-going.

The titration nurse said that due to shortages, the best she could do was write a prescription for a generic that's 25% less than my usual dose, and just a single extended release, and not the patented Concerta XL release mechanism (Xaggatin), but still the same number of top-up doses. Reading online about people saying Xaggatin ""hits you like a tonne of bricks"" and has made some people feel ""suicidal"" versus Concerta XL. That does ***not*** sound pleasant. But then again, in worry-about-all-the-things mode.

I know, I should be grateful I'm being treated, but it honestly feels like the quality of care in this country is inadequate. I actually asked my titration nurse a few days ago if she would recommend extending the titration process and trying a different medication that might be available more consistently, but got no response. It's a total rollercoaster with this ""here's this thing that helps you, oh wait, we're out of it"" thing again and again.

Is this really what the future is going to be like with worrying about availability of my medication constantly?",1b1rod7,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1b1rod7/puk_end_of_titration_review_tomorrowtoday_and/,"['It looks like this post might be about medication.\n\nPlease remember that whilst personal experiences and advice can be valuable, Reddit is no replacement for your GP or Psychiatrist and taking advice from anyone about your particular situation other than your trained healthcare professional is potentially unsafe.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

BPD is destroying my life,"I (20F) have BPD. I was diagnosed only last year though I've been investigating the possibility of having BPD since I was 17. I've had mania episodes that lasted weeks, once I had an episode that lasted almost a month. It's never easy, it's always the same, I suddently go into a profound depression idealizing suicide every single time. I've had problems with self harm since I was 12, though I've been clean for almost 3 months thankfully. 

Thing is, I've been on therapy, meds, communities aimed to help, even tried having a religion, nothing worked. My therapist says it's unforunately a life long disease with barely nothing capable of helping and it gives me even less hope. I've tried everything, most things that works for other BPD people doesn't work for me. It's difficult for people to bear with me or understand me, relationships never last because it's literally impossible for me to control my emotions during an episode. Yeah, I can manage to tone it down but it's never enough.

Knowing I'll live my whole life like this, being alone, snapping suddently, getting week's long idealizations of suicide and constant self harm relapses makes me want to live even less. I wish something worked for me or that at least someone was patient enough to try and understand me.",1b1ro3v,4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1b1ro3v/bpd_is_destroying_my_life/,"[""Are you willing to share what meds you are on.

"As someone who isn't a Superman fan, I can't wait for Superman: Legacy. ","Whoa Whoa Whoa. No need for the pitchforks, let me explain. When I say I'm not a fan of Superman, I don't mean that I dislike him (I don't) nor do I mean that I don't like him (I do like him). I'm simply not very familiar with the character and love other characters more. I've read exactly three Superman stories, and enjoyed two of them. 

So why Am I excited for Superman: Legacy? I think mainly because it's appropriately a new hope for all DC fans. I admittedly prefer Marvel a little bit, mainly because the MCU is what got me fully into the superhero genre and because Spider-Man is my favorite hero, but I have been losing passion for the MCU slowly since Endgame wrapped up the Infinity Saga. Mind you, I enjoyed a lot of projects post-Endgame to varying degrees, but I think a part of me feels like I already got my ""fix"" of Marvel films with so many good ones in the Infinity Saga. 

DC though? Well, there aren't many films I liked in the DCEU, and I think a part of that is because my favorite heroes weren't really in it. With the Superhero fatigue settling in, we know that being ""decent"" or ""fun"" just doesn't cut it anymore. You need really good films to make an impression, like The Batman, Guardians of The Galaxy vol 3 and  Spider-Man: No Way Home. Superman: Legacy has to be *great* to help restore the DC brand and pave the road for other projects. 

Do I want Superman: Legacy to succeed simply to pave the road for other characters and projects? Not at all. Like I said, I do like Superman, even if I like other characters more. And while I think his humor is a bit hit or miss for me, I think James Gunn has made arguably the second-best MCU trilogy, and I hope he can have the range and flexibility to do a great Superman movie. Supes obviously needs a rather different tone from Gunn's previous comic book movies, but I am encouraged by the fact that James has stated that the film *won't* be a comedy and that he won't be taking his usual creative liberties when it comes to Superman considering Supes is very high-profile and needs to be done by the book (in terms of characterization) compared to GotG and Suicide Squad. 

Eitherway, a great movie or show always brings in new fans of the source material. Let's hope Superman: Legacy can be that adrenaline shot DC needs to get back into the game.

A humble request to the little gay people in my phone,"TW: talk of suicide below

I don't know where else to ask this so here goes. I have a friend who lives in another country. His depression has hit an all time high, and he is not doing well. He doesn't have the money to seek professional help. I try to help in any way I can by being there and listening to whatever he has to say, but aside from repeating some things my own therapist told me I'm bad at giving advice. It has gotten pretty bad. I brought up the idea of getting him to write a suicide help plan for when he feels at his lowest because he's mentioned suicide a lot, but aside from that I am pretty clueless on what to do.

Does anyone know of any apps (or any other free, accessible thing) that could possibly help him out? Even just a little?

There is no way out,"I was tryin my best, I really was. For 38 years. I come from broken alcoholic family, mother hated me, abused me and called me names, father never wanted me, step father sexually harrased me. I lived with grandparents who were fighting constantly. Rest of the family was just waiting till one of them dies, they took home, sold it and left me homeless. I was such a good student, never did drugs, alcohol, nothing. Yet, they didnt care. My grandmother went mad in head and with their 'help' killed my precious rabbit and dog. She later commited suicide. I left to abroad for work, lasted 3 years before I broke down with depression and panic attacks and had to go back to poverty homeland, I lost my job and it took 1 year and my savings to be able to somehow function again. All the men I had lied to me, cheated, some attacked me physically too. I had one very close man, but his family didnt want him to leave house and be with me. When we went abroad, his dad commited suicide, he turned it against me, accused me its my fault too and now I am alone, ill with post covid, with no family, no love, no pet, nothing. I am close to being homeless, I suffer so much I cant work full time, only part time, Im hungry, exhausted, always worrying about roof over my head, I rent one room with strangers in house, I have no true friends, the only one died of suicide, the other one of cancer. I have huge port wine stain on my leg, marks on my face, laser wont touch it. People called me ugly, for some men I was good enough only when I was thin, when I put on weight on antidepressant, they didnt like me anymore. I have scars from being bullied at school. I cant do this anymore. I cant carry on this life, Im so alone in this world, there is noone I can trust, I was also robbed of money and I hurt so much inside this is beyond repair. No doctors know how to help, medications have bad side effects on me because I also have MCAS. I really tried to rely on God, to be a good woman, but I became bitter and so negative that now noone would even want me. I cant change anything, whatever I try, it turns out even worse than before. I really think some of us shouldnt have been born, my whole life is pure suffering. I wont survive another year, I have noone to help me.

I hate my job, I have no friends. Yesterday I went on a date with a guy and he was perfect but today he's not really interested anymore. I feel like a piece of meat, a good for nothing bitch.

Please help,"I (18M) have been struggling with an intense mental state for years now, idk when it began. Almost two years ago, I saw a therapist for my symptoms and she suggested Borderline Personality Disorder. It never made it to my official diagnosis list as I was diagnosed with autism soon after and nothing was ever said of it again.
But I‚Äôve been doing research recently and I‚Äôm having thoughts again. I can‚Äôt even begin to fully describe the mental hell I‚Äôm in. It‚Äôs so exhausting. I also struggle with GAD, MDD, mild PTSD, and OCD (current diagnoses), but what I‚Äôm going through feels outside the range of this.
The first and maybe worst symptom I experience is in regards to drastic mood swings. I feel content and pretty joyful, confident even, which is incredibly rare for me as my self esteem is in ruins. One day I‚Äôll feel worthy, attractive, cool, whatever, and then back to feeling like I deserve death after a small trigger. The most minor incident or dispute will send me spiraling. Like, I‚Äôm talking considering suicide. I don‚Äôt think I could ever actually do it, as I do have a will to live and a fear of death, but it gets intense and rarely leads to some form of self harm when I have a total breakdown/rage. 
The way I see people close to me drastically shifts too. My mind seems to self sabotage. My partner and I occasionally have some arguments over little things, nothing severe, but it makes me SO upset that I‚Äôll feel angry towards them, or as if they hate me and will leave me (irrationally). That said, I do have a severe fear of abandonment and rejection. Then as soon as they hug me, I feel as if everything is perfect again and my opinion switches drastically. I can‚Äôt take these ups and downs. I can‚Äôt keep going from hot to cold, from wanting to live and feeling like I have a future to feeling like dying and that I‚Äôm worthless the next day. It‚Äôs so unstable. I keep ruining my life by acting on impulses that are rewarding in the moment but ultimately harm me. I also need to be assessed again for ADHD due to chronic attention and hyperactivity issues, so I wonder if that‚Äôs connected as well, considering the similarities between it and BPD.
(Important: My depression and anxiety are genetic, my OCD and PTSD are trauma induced from what I know. I‚Äôve had a few awful experiences that affected me outside my genetics) 
I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm not asking for a diagnosis of course, but those who have BPD, does this align with what it‚Äôs like? I‚Äôm considering seeking help again and maybe bringing up the possibility to a psychologist. I can‚Äôt keep doing this. It hurts so bad I just want to scream, and I can‚Äôt kill myself because I love so much in this world but I‚Äôm in so much pain. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy sometimes. I want to escape.

Open letter to 1BCT 101st,"Dear Daddy Air Assault,

I‚Äôd like to help you with some issues and open your eyes. Since we got back from our great deployment, there have been 3 suicides and 12 attempts. In addition to that, some battalions are having a DUI almost once a week (and a good majority of soldiers getting DUI are senior noncommissioned officers). Soldiers are going to PMO and having positive drug tests left and right; these are metrics that I‚Äôll let you know are not good and you don‚Äôt want on your OER/NCOER. The tasking and uptempo has been non-stop the moment we got back, and you can say, ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt have made it a day back in my army days,‚Äù and I would tell you to pull out a mirror and notice the problem‚Äîit is you. I‚Äôve always heard the best way to get someone to do something is to demotivate them, and the new air assault ideas of driving non-qualified individuals to AA school and having them run back will definitely help meet your goals of instilling an air assault culture. I‚Äôve been at Fort Campbell since 2021, and in that time, the OPTEMO has never stopped. You can ask yourself why we have the lowest retention in the 18th airborne, and I can tell you it‚Äôs because soldiers have been beat down and haven‚Äôt had any opportunity to truly reset or have time away from work (two weeks of block leave does not counter an 9-month deployment). Within my time at Fort Campbell, I have personally been away from my house more than 50% of the time due to JRTC, two DTDs, Bastone Phoenix, deployment, and all the random things like live fire ranges, and I honestly could have just lived in the MP and saved some money and not pay for a empty house on base oh and losing money. Either way, YOU won‚Äôt change things; clean clubs, R2E and the new Bastogne mindset will save the day, and the West Point mission will inspire everyone to air assault their way out of 1BCT. I‚Äôd rather take my chances with a recruiter spot and enjoy less toxicity in my workplace.

"Weird Symptoms after Polypectomy / Turbinate reduction, Am I on the path to ENS?","I had a nasal polypectomy with turbinate reduction 3 years or some ago.

3 Weeks after that I had something weird spontaneously happen on my right nostril and I felt how air got trapped? between my right nostril sinuses and my chest (almost seemed like a heart attack i got tunnel vision and palpitations / anxiety / fast heart beat etc for like a couple of hours).

Since then I have had head pressure that does not go away, chest discomfort, throat discomfort ALL on the right side and cognitive symptoms like memory issues, vision issues brain fog, which get better with medicine and exercise etc, I had a septoplasty that also helped the symptoms. (These symptoms have gotten notably better with lifestyle changes/medicine (anti inflammatories steroids pill and spray) and the septoplasty but not 100% back to normal.

Apparently after some CT scans and seeing an ENT specializing in noses, they diagnosed an interior right nasal valve collapse, caused by the polypectomy / turbinate reduction, she was quiet furious my other ENT that did the septoplasty didnt repair the nasal valve collapse.

ENT also said I had my turbinates reduced a lot and diagnosed atrophic rhinitis / dry rhinitis, she said she can repair the valve but she stated that she isnt sure they will relieve my symptoms, which made me worried I will have to live like this.

I do not feel like my nose is dry and I can take deep breaths normally even with my right side obstruction, I do not have hyper ventilation and I can still smell, nose doesnt feel dry, I sleep breathing through my nose even though my sleep quality is still kinda shit (gotta fix this with sleep studies?)

My worry is these symptoms of nose / frontal sinus pressure with no infection confirmed by CT scans, does ENS cause sinus pressure like that? I am hoping the valve repair will help me relieve this symptoms as everything points to that right side nostril issue being the cause of everything because living with this head pressure is crazy, its not like suicide inducing but jesus sake its extremely uncomfortable.

Latest CT scan of my nose below.

ENS is just a syndrome which means that you experience a certain combination of specific symptoms after surgery, which the ENS6Q tries to define. Sinus pressure is not on this list but of course it can happen and certainly does for some patients, it just is not a hallmark symptom of ENS but rather a very common symptom which applies to a lot of nose-related conditions. \n\nSince you've stated that your nose does not feel dry and you can take deep breaths and you didn't mention openness or suffocation, it does not feel too much like ENS to me. I'm surprised you were diagnosed with atrophic rhinitis / dry rhinitis while saying your nose does not feel dry (especially since ENS and secondary atrophic rhinitis are sometimes used interchangebly or are at least share similarities). You currently can't diagnose ENS from a CT, especially from a single slice, so the scan is not really helpful, but I can see that they've been reduced. It is probably mentioned below most posts here, but please calculate your ens6q score, it is very easy to do and will provide a reliable overview.""]"
What on earth is wrong with me?,"Sorry if this is all jumbled and doesn't make too much sense, I have so many thoughts I don't even know where to begin.

I (F 27) have been suffering with depression for a good part of the last 10 years but I slowly think I am descending into just full blown madness.

I used to have low mood, low energy, no motivation for life, was a people pleaser, terrified to lose anyone etc. However in the last 3 years I've experienced  a traumatic break up with my daughter's (2F) father, the loss of my closest grandparent, going no contact with narcissistic father and my sibling going to prison. I began to make suicide plans January 2023 and decided fuck it I'll start frittering my money away, having unprotected sex, leaving work unexpectedly/not turning up, telling the horrible people in my life what I truly think of them (I.e being a massive bitch). 

After a good few weeks engaging in this behaviour I realised, hey I actually quite enjoy life when I just do whatever the fuck I like, but then something will make the realisation hit; get further into debt, realise I've pushed all my friends and family away with my unkind words, got myself in some unsafe situations sleeping with men I don't even know. So I sob and attempt suicide, I sit on a bridge or train track debating my choice, I unpack all my medication and sit considering an overdose. Then I remember my daughter, the good times, the very few people that love me, and I decide to live.

Then this cycle repeats, over and over and over. 

I so desperately want to die but I also want to live. I have so many conflicting thoughts and behaviours I don't even know who I am. One minute I am the home goddess mother of the year, making home cooked food, planning to make my life better. Then the next I am screaming with rage, hitting myself, falling out with anybody close enough to get to, etc. this switch can happen within a matter of days.

Just a week ago I seriously debated my life and after an hour long call with the Samaritans I decided to live (again, how pathetic). A mere 24 hours layered I'm in a coffee shop with my mum and daughter buying a jigsaw n debating what to have for tea. 

I have tried to research what is wrong with me and most importantly what is the fix, but I seem to identify with everything, depression, anxiety, adhd, BPD, bipolar. All I know is the sertraline I'm on currently is clearly not working, I feel like my death is the only escape because I cannot live in this state forever. I hate myself.

Also just to add, I do not ever put my daughter in a position of harm or where she is not safe. Most of my ""breakdowns"" happen when she is with her father and I can truly ""feel"" my emotions. I love her with all my heart and she is my only motivation for living on.

I am receiving support from my GP but I am not due to speak to her until 27/03 as she wants me to up my sertraline and see how that changes things.

What do I need to do to break this cycle and just be normal?

What‚Äôs up with all these high level players breaching every time they get into a fight?,"Why is it that most of the players seem to be completely unaware that the biggest targets are not the biggest threats. This is especially true on the terminid side. 

One thing I‚Äôm experiencing almost on repeat in pug matches on around level 6-8, is players being completely blind to the mobs that cause breaches. I literally witnessed multiple people swear that 500 kills and 9 deaths in a match was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for 6 diff. It‚Äôs not even normal for helldive. It means you can‚Äôt initiate without breaching. I personally think, even though this is gone over in the tutorial, they really need to emphasize target prioritization far more in training. 

Not even kidding, I just played a match where 3 other 30+ players on diff 7 thought a dozen BTs,  30 chargers and probably over 50 spewers was just normal. They constantly ignored scavs. Didn‚Äôt close holes etc etc. They‚Äôd initiate, leave all the scavs alive and run while they breached repeatedly behind them. It was wild. I‚Äôve seen it MANY times.

Why is this so common? How did these players even get to nearly 40 like this? Why do so many of these players get mad when you try to explain they‚Äôre looking at this wrong? 

No lie, I‚Äôve had easier runs soloing helldive than 4 manning suicide and that‚Äôs wild. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

105 days sober from Weed. Considering moderation soon.. ,"Hello community! 
This thread has kept me going through the roughest cravings and even the many moments I felt suicidal going through withdrawal, especially since weed was my medicine for 10 years. 
Over 100 days without and I can confidently say I feel emotionally in control of the habit like I could choose how I use it or not. I like to think I would have that same mentality if I decided to take a bong rip every now and then without slipping into daily use again. 
I know I can‚Äôt smoke like I used to. I was living with daily nausea, terrible stomach cramps before going to the bathroom and probably extra lingering anxiety. And eventually back to back hypermesis episodes that required ER intervention. All of that is gone now but I still miss it and would like to try moderation at some point soon. I want to be able to smoke once a month or so. That‚Äôs it- daily smoking wasn‚Äôt great for me anyway because it would make me so tired and messed with my appetite.

I think everyone is suicidal a tiny bit. Maybe too afraid to tell it, share it, breathe it, so they pretend they never were. That it never was. I am not. I am suicidal in every thought I think, every breath I breathe. I am suicidal when there is something there is something I don‚Äôt want to do. I am suicidal when I cannot sleep at night. I am suicidal when I cry with the door locked. I am suicidal while watching the happy faces around me. I am suicidal. I was not‚Äînever‚Äîmeant to be. I have no desires, no passions. I desire absolutely nothing. I do not desire to meet new people or spite those I hate. I do not desire getting a job or pursuing any passion. I have no desire for a wild sunny adventure or a dance in the wildflowers. I have a desire to feel my bones crack and splinter at the bottom of a bridge. I have a desire to throw up all over my favorite shirt after downing a bottle of pills. I have a desire to see bright blinding lights before the train hits me.


I cry a lot. It starts when the distractions wear off and dinner has been ate and I am laying alone in my dark room. It starts in my eyes, they start to feel heavy. The world around me blurs. It spreads to my arms. They coil tightly around my favorite stuffed animal. They trace patterns on my own arm, seeking a semblance of warm comforting contact. (It is not warm. My hand are dry and cold. It reminds me I need to pretend.) it spreads to my legs after that. They curl up, up and up until they meet my chest and my hands grip them so tight my knuckles whiten, trying to disappear. It moves to my chest. It burns a hot angry spot in the middle. It spreads from that spot to my hands that curl up in weak pitiful fists. It is all hot and angry by then. It moves to my eyes and by then even my tears feel angry, because how could anyone ever deserve this? 


My beside table is riddled with pills and bandages. My room holds the stench of desperation and pity. At night it all wraps around me as a lullaby and I fall asleep knowing this is all I will ever be and all I could have ever been. 


Living is not something of an enjoyable experience for me. It sets all my nerves on fire and makes my fingers shake. It‚Äôs cruel and has no pattern, I cannot read it, I fail to figure it out at all. I do not believe I ever will. 


 My mind is not the only thing falling apart anymore. No matter how much I try to stop it, my body splinters and cracks, only it bleeds red tears


I think I‚Äôve run out of beginnings. I am a tragically reimagined Icarus. I fall and I fall, gazing up at what it could of been and what it will now never be. (I get up, I don‚Äôt listen, I fall. I get up, I listen until all I hear are lies, I fall. I don‚Äôt get up. I don‚Äôt get up.)


My presence is stale. That‚Äôs all. There‚Äôs something about me that‚Äôs stale. My words, my jokes, my being. I have nothing to give, nothing to offer. The air around me is dry and I drain those around me, I just sit there and stare, occasionally I stand there and stare. 


I hope one day, with a book in hand and braided hair and warm sun littering the ground, I climb a tall, beautiful tree. I take a step too risky, too high. Crack. Thud. Silence. Sirens. Silence.


Rule one. Don‚Äôt fight it. Push them away. Stay up every night staring at the ceiling. Lose interest in the things you love. Hate yourself. Don‚Äôt fight it or it‚Äôll fight back. It‚Äôll hit and hit until you can‚Äôt get up. and just when you think it‚Äôs done it‚Äôll come back to spit at your crumpled form.  Don‚Äôt fight it. Become a secondary character in your own story. Drink black bitter coffee. Learn to love the taste of it dripping down your throat. Find comfort in the sour feeling coming from your stomach. Don‚Äôt fight it.


(If you read all these thank you! Now, let me give you a guide on how to live another day. Take a shower (don‚Äôt sit down), listen to happy music while you do.

I think I'd rather kill myself than deal with my ODD child anymore,"I'm at the end.  I can't take it anymore.  I hate drama and it's all my life is anymore.  I cry every day.  I scream every day.  

My daughter is 13 and in constant trouble.   I mean...constant.  

She was diagnosed with ODD.  I don't know about the diagnosis; I've heard it's controversial and often hastily arrived at, although the description fits her.

Stealing, lying, lying and more lying.  Sneaking out at night, stealing $1,400 (pretty much everything I saved from working 60-70 hours per week all fall), problems at school, I've had to report her as a runaway twice in two months. Drugs, more lying.  Thousands of dollars in damages to the house. More lying.  Caught her twice in the last week creeping around in my bedroom after I went to sleep.

We just got off a virtual court hearing for a truancy probation violation and she tried to go ""sleep"" which means lying on her bed and sitting on her phone.  She has a flip phone now because she couldn't behave on a smartphone.  I took the phone and told her she could have it back after she gave me the password and I could review the usage, because I suspect she's been talking to and is sexually involved with an older guy.

She in turn grabbed my phone and erased all the data.  So I turned around and reported her to the sheriff for felony theft.  I've been thinking of it since I discovered the $1,400 missing from my account about a month ago and my boyfriend has been trying to get me to report it, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

I can't keep my cool anymore.  She laughs at me when I tell her to do something, says no, and yells ""CPS report"" if I touch her.  CPS was already called about a false accusation in November.  They want to talk to me again about another allegation made after I caught her sneaking out of the house last week.  We had a serious row that night and we are getting more and more volatile as she gets older and meaner.  I've been putting them off because I seriously can't take much more of the calls, appointments, police meetings, etc.  It's EVERY FUCKING DAY.  Her bullshit has sucked up three full workdays between last week and today.  I go to work, but get less than the bare minimum done.

I seriously hate my life and I don't think I can do this much longer.  I think about suicide daily.

"Let's talk about the psychological impact of PSSD (or PAWS, for that matter)","I'd like to develop more resources for people especially those who are possibly new or whose mental state has worsened after getting PSSD and/or PAWS. I want to be understood clearly that I am not saying PSSD is psychological.  The majority of people who are wanting to feel better, or who do feel better, leave the forums, because they are trying to de-stress, and it's very important to also recognize that many people have extreme medical trauma when they learn this happened, it's pretty understandable to go off the deep end with stress and upset due to the psychological shock that's something bad could have happened or is happening. I've attempted to write the FAQ for this. More of those people have been coming back and sharing their story and updating after more time has passed which is a positive development, I have seen probably 10 or 20 of those in the last few months.

I was personally diagnosed with severe post traumatic stress disorder due to the complete shock and terror of developing numb genitals overnight. I also felt extreme betrayal for trusting my doctor who attacked, minimized, belittled, and gaslighted me as well as overtly blamed me when I brought it to her attention. which is literally emotional abuse. [What Is Medical Trauma? (verywellmind.com)](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-medical-trauma-5211358) I've improved a lot overall in these last 12 years unfortunately significant genital sensation loss as well as partial orgasm/libido loss persists; I do have real PSSD. So also before someone takes this post wrong please recognize that I used to have the full parade of terrible symptoms for years also including bad anhedonia, brain fog, DPDR and extreme fatigue. This is not a ""just cope, bro"" post and it's not intended to be blaming people for any reason. I'd just like people to feel as OK as they possibly can.

I've recently gained benefit from browsing r/HealthAnxiety which discusses how medical trauma can cause a form of extreme anxiety aka obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) focused on attunement to health. This could look like constant monitoring of symptoms, constant checking of posts/comments, constant reassurance seeking, and constant mental spiraling about the worst case scenario, obviously this HA subreddit is of generally limited value given that we actually do have a real health problem, but I encourage you to explore it and recognize that stress can exacerbate the nonsexual symptoms.

[Is it health anxiety, or medical trauma? : HealthAnxiety (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/14ra6lm/is_it_health_anxiety_or_medical_trauma/)

[Is HA just a form of OCD? : HealthAnxiety (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/16m2p4v/is_ha_just_a_form_of_ocd/)

 [is health anxiety a form of OCD? : HealthAnxiety (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/zfi93e/is_health_anxiety_a_form_of_ocd/) 

Obviously if you don't struggle with obsessive anxiety about your PSSD then scroll past this and consider it not relevant to you. Also obviously this is a coping technique I'm not saying we should all accept PSSD we should fund research and promote awareness so that we can get an answer in the meantime it's miserable to obsess on it 24/7. ***""As someone explained below, symptoms checking is obsession and googling/asking for reassurance/justifying symptoms is a compulsion. The cycle repeats itself with more symptoms. The point is you need to learn to live with uncertainty, cannot Google/reassure yourself and learn being uncomfortable not knowing 100% what‚Äôs going to happen. ""***

I plan to self administer ERP therapy to try to feel better about PSSD stress, and I think it can definitely help lower the distress I feel about fluctuations in my symptoms, I watched this really interesting video about how OCD is different from normal anxiety it basically involves a compulsion to ruminate or seek reassurance but that doesn't actually help the person calm down it just makes them spiral worse with their anxiety long term. If people give in to the obsessing and the trauma it really risks ending up in a suicide or just a very bad quality of life. Even with fall on anhedonia also, it's still important to try to leave the house even if someone can't feel things normally as well. With the neuroplasticity aspect it's important to try to keep exercising those healthy brain paths. Again please have nuance and recognize that I'm not saying that people should just cope with this we need research and we need awareness so that we can get a physical cure in the meantime please try not to feel even worse with stress/anxiety.

Even still living with significant general sensation loss I am going to try pelvic floor therapy, and I am glad that somebody shared that here even if I don't get my sensation back 100 percent at least I can be more functional in a relationship and work around it is my hope. Anyway people also get super upset saying that people are saying that PSSD is psychological that's obviously not what we're saying what we're saying is that the necessity and benefits of trying to manage your mental health doesn't go away just because you have PSSD and in fact it may become even more critical. There's a lot of systemic problems with therapy and psychiatry but we can't let them just leave us abandoned we have to keep fighting for a better life in any way we can, I don't think people who have not improved are at fault, Also I had over four years of PTSD therapy for this and I think that's the reason I didn't go off the deep end I had prolonged exposure (PE) therapy as well as CPT, I also had DBT to learn coping skills.

**Also, that being said with our current theory that PSSD may be an autoimmune or inflammatory condition, stress management is critical.** Dysregulation of the HPA axis can depress your immune system and imbalance your microbiome as well as many other symptoms. Even if it's the SSRI that put us in this state of extreme stress recognize that we can try to lower it.

[Stress Response Hyperstimulation - AnxietyCentre.com](https://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-disorders/symptoms/hyperstimulation/)

Before people get mad at me and lash out, again I've been living with this for 12 years and again it's gotten way better in a lot of ways (I have friends, I work, I have hobbies, I enjoy food and music, I try to carry on). Stress is a huge contributor to flare ups even of normal diseases, where the person is neurotypical and has never taken an SSRI. Constant obsessing and stress is only bad for your health, for anyone. Again I will clarify for nuance I am not saying that destressing will solve everybody's problems especially not overnight. There are people who are seriously physically disabled by Ssri's and that is real I am talking about the aspects of mental health that are controllable or influenceable on some level in the circumstances. Also regardless of health, sometimes these people go off the deep end when something suddenly changes ([for example family men who lost their life savings and salary in the USA market crash of 2008 and committed suicide](https://money.cnn.com/2013/09/18/news/economy/financial-crisis-suicide/index.html)) so it's really important that we recognize psychological shock in our community.",1b1qyln,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/comments/1b1qyln/lets_talk_about_the_psychological_impact_of_pssd/,"[""**Please read our pinned FAQ, rules, and sidebar before participating**.

"Is ALL life actually valuable, or what the life does thats valuable?","For the past many years I've been in deep thought regarding certain beliefs or aspects regarding life (and death), and one that became a major thorn in my side is the value of life. When ever people talk about murders or suicide, someone always says something to the general affect of ""Their life was so valuable!"" Now my question is, is the life itself valuable, or is it what the life accomplishes thats of value?

Here is my logic: lets use Hitler and Kurt Cobain (first guy to pop in my head) as examples.

Assuming ALL life is valuable, then people would have cried when Hitler died. Now I know some did, but the majority of people probably didn't. Anyhow, this could kind of prove that the life itself isn't of value, but what hitler did with his life is of value. He didn't save people; he killed 6 million jews and started a world war that killed 60 million people. He didn't oversee the creation of many scientific marvels for the betterment of humanity; he oversaw the pioneering of intercontinental rockets and jets, all of which had the sole purpose of killing people.

Then there is Kurt Cobain. He was just a rock star who made music many could relate to, and became the voice of a generation. He didn't kill people; he made people feel better. He didn't oversee the creation of weapons of mass destruction; he oversaw the creation of an entirely new kind of music: grunge and alternative.

By the logic that all life is valuable, both Hitler and Kurt Cobain would both be sitting on a pedestol with people loving them. But only one has love while the other has become the personification of hate. Hitler used his life to do bad, and he is viewed as garbage. Kurt used his life to do good, and he is in the pages of rock history and the minds of most gen-x'ers as someone they could relate to.

But on the other hand, if the life has to do some good to be considered valuable, then I'm of no value because I haven't acheived much in my life. Ergo, if I die tomorrow, no one should weep or mourn my sudden passing.

29F

I have BPD and can‚Äôt quite get a hang of my anger and go into impulsive rages sometimes after confrontation. 

Long story short, I impulsively took 250mg of quetiapine and 250mg of tramadol together with 2g of paracetamol and 200mg of topirimate. 

I‚Äôm not even suicidal; I just don‚Äôt think straight at all and can‚Äôt control myself. One minute I‚Äôm out of control and the next I‚Äôm like ooops
Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have taken that. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre fairly safe doses, not something to repeat of course but just want to check?

Urgent (17 F),"I am seventeen and female. I live in NY, wherein I am able to consent to sex. A few months ago I met up with a guy (30) while I was presumably manic. I can never tell, as I am on a mostly successful mood stabilizer. Still, I am prone to irrational behavior during a higher mood period. I have rapid cycle bipolar disorder. I am only trying to explain my reasoning and I am NOT trying to victimize myself. Anyways. I met up with this total moron at a park and had a sexual encounter. When he first got there he called me and became very angry when I said I was too nervous to go. He said a few nasty things and he made me feel very guilty. I made a poor decision and went to meet him. I got there and he couldn‚Äôt get over how young I looked, he was ecstatic. He never checked my ID. ‚ÄúI love that you are as young as you can be without getting me in trouble‚Äù, verbatim. I met him on a CNC subreddit. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have been there. He tried to kiss me but it was just disgusting, I hated him from the moment I saw him. I told him about a relationship I had with a nurse (24 M) I met in a psychiatric hospital following a suicide attempt almost a year ago. He has that against me. I messaged him after leaving and said that I did not wish to see him again. He was very very upset with me and I am incredibly paranoid that he will try to defame me in some way. We did not have sex as I wanted to remain a ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù. Still, he brought a dildo and entered me with it and it was very painful. He was very rough with me and I bled afterwards. He was so obsessed with my appearance that I am sure he could recognize me in an instant. Come to find, my class is taking a field trip to a plant very near the one he works at. I truly want to go, but I fear that he will be there. Perhaps he got a new job at the one I am visiting? They are the same sort of business. What would I do if he learned my name and where I live/go to school? To clarify; I met him on a rape kink forum. I agreed to meet him and I am able to consent. In no way am I innocent. Do you think I should go on this trip, or will I be met with the fate I have earned? I am sorry that this is so long.

This will be the death of you, and Reddit can only play therapist for so long until you ruin your life, and even therapy won\'t help. You need to reread your post and ask yourself what you want. Help, or internet validation. Because, this shit doesn\'t add up. \n\nIf I get downvoted it is what it is. I\'m gonna tell you what you need to hear in real life. This is my problem with you:\n\nYou are hard-core, lightning quick to be a smartass to people who don\'t give you the responses you want. The rest of Reddit is already giving you the answer you need, but you\'re quick to ""clap back"" to every comment telling you that you know better than you put forward. So, I\'m torn here, and I need to know exactly what kind of help you\'re looking for here. Because, you\'re giving a hard vibe that you are seeking nothing but validation after making a VERY shitty fucking choice with someone you knew was a POS.\n\nGenuinely asking: What *exactly* is stopping you from seeking a trusted adult about this? So, you really think you accidentally planned an entire sexual encounter with a child predator because you were manic and didn\'t know what you were doing? That\'s bullshit. And, you know it.\n\nIf you have the power to make this post, seek advice, and think over everything you are told, you have the power and the knowledge to understand what\'s wrong here. You\'re still able to post online about this, but you can\'t find a trusted adult anywhere whatsoever...?\n\nDo you understand that meeting with a 30 year old man in your own power and making sure no one knows you are meeting with him, is a decision? I\'m sorry, but there is just zero accountability on your part, and as long as your mental illness is a crutch for your choices, you\'ll keep making shitty ones.\n\nI get it. You\'re 17, and youre dealing with trauma. But, I\'ll be the first to tell you: Get your shit together, and stop acting like you don\'t know what you are doing. If you have the sense to post it, and *admit you know it\'s wrong*, you have the sense to find a trusted adult. Reddit cannot save you from your reality. You are making life threatening decisions and knowingly using your diagnoses as a crutch to keep making selfish decisions, and just so you\'d know, you can still meet the wrong person. Being dead will make pity a penny in the well for you. You were brutally raped, and now you are ON REDDIT, asking what the fuck to do....\n\nGET OFF THE INTERNET AND GO TO AUTHORITIES. TELL A TRUSTED ADULT. Seek help and counseling in real life, or keep drowning in yourself because you think getting validation from Reddit is more important than securing your body and life.\n\nYou need to understand something: Consent to sex, is a choice. That is why it is called consent. You knowingly consented to a man who is sexually infatuated with underage girls, and your only explanation is being manic. You can be manic and still get STDs and permanent injuries because you can\'t get ahold of yourself, and want to make excuses. You would have kept fucking him if it went any way otherwise. Which is exactly why you are telling the internet rather than anyone else.\n\nYour illnesses doesn\'t stop you from knowing you\'re doing stupid shit, ma\'am. If you have the sense and the mind process to lay out everything you\'re doing into a post, you have the fucking mind to get your shit together and find help no matter what.\n\nBeing 17 and manic isn\'t an excuse for feeding child predators and other the shitty decisions that you are knowingly hiding and lying about before you make them. You will continue to put yourself at risk and be nothing but a liability for your parents, and a paycheck for a therapist as long as you keep acting like you don\'t fucking know any better.\n\nGood luck.', ""Just remember that you are old enough to consent but that does not mean you've lost the right to refuse.

This means although the age of consent in my state is 16, no one older than 19 can have consensual sex with a 16 year old since the age of consent federally is still 18. It protects young adults who are in similar developmental stages from being seen as ‚Äútaking advantage of a child‚Äù which can obviously still happen with power dynamics, but not purely on the basis of a 3 year age gap. Point being, being 17 in new york and having sex with a 30 year old is still likely illegal for him. I hope you find the help you need. I would try to tell a trusted adult.', 'Do not go.

Then I read you met him at a 'rape kink forum'. I wasn't even aware such threads exist openly on the internet. I don't think you consented to having sexual acts performed on you because you tell here that you said no and he tried to guilt trip. Then, he inserted a dildo into your vagina, and you say it was rough and you also bled. This signifies he was aggressive enough to cause tears inside. Honestly, through this ordeal, you would have reacted negatively, cried, or screamed or even resisted, he did not stop. You are able to consent legally, but did not actually consent.

He raped you and then also is a threat to you.\n\nInform your parents or at least an adult you really trust and take this further. He is a dangerous element.

You have already attempted suicide once in your life. I do not blame you really for being on one of those rape kink forums, your mental health is haywire. You need to seek help as well. You are undergoing some unimaginable trauma and it needs fixing. But take action against him. As for now, if you think you'll be uncomfortable on the trip, don't go.

It‚Äôs so crazy to think about if that one kid didn‚Äôt see me with a knife I wouldn‚Äôt be here to enjoy all the wonderful things life has to offer.', ""Sounds like when I found out how my option wasn't gonna work. \n\nJolly good chuckle that."", 'Dude found a IRL Easter egg', ""that's so funny. for me it was when Alfred Camus said he was going to drink a coffee instead of shot himself w/ a gun."", 'Turns out saws are designed to cut specific materials üòÖ', 'What stopped me, was the thought of me being a statistic among my demographic. I thought there had to be a different way. Because for once in my life I actually loved myself, despite bullying, losing my girlfriend, and political propaganda. \n\nSo I listened to a podcast about ""Optimistic Nihilism."" And it made me just view life differently. Made me motivated. But it\'s definitely has been a rough few years.', 'spite', 'might be clich√©, but clich√©s exist for a reason.\n\nit was my mom and my dogs. i got real close to the edge and had thoughts about it for months. but at the time my mom was disabled and we had two dogs. i knew my mom was in a tough spot mentally because her disability was from an injury and she was barely keeping it together. if i left i knew she‚Äôd probably join me not long after. and i would have no idea if the dogs would go to a good home or if they‚Äôd end up getting euthanized in a shelter. \n\nso i hunkered down, graduated high school, got my mental problems properly diagnosed, got on the right meds, and started working. and my mom‚Äôs life-long chronic pain turned out to not be so life-long after a cutting-edge (at the time) treatment.']"
